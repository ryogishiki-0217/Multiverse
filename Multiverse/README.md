## ⚡ TL;DR

Multiverse is a generative modeling framework that natively supports parallel generation for efficient test-time scaling. We provide an end-to-end ecosystem for building and deploying Multiverse models in real-world applications.

## 🎬 Demo

We showcase a Multiverse model solving a math reasoning problem, demonstrating its parallel generation capabilities.

## 🏛️ Repository Structure

This repository provides a complete ecosystem for building and deploying Multiverse models. Our structure is organized as follows:

**🗂️ `data`** → **📈 `train`** → **🚀 `inference`**

```
Multiverse
├── data/
│   └── src
|   └── run
|   └── README.md
│
├── train
│   └── README.md
│
├── inference/
│   └── engine
|   └── README.md
│
└── README.md
```

- **`data/`**: Contains the **Multiverse Curator** toolkit for dataset preparation. Use it to generate your own **Multiverse-1K** dataset for training.

- **`training/`**: Implements the **Multiverse Attention** algorithm for the efficient training of Multiverse models. We also includes the code for AR baselines

- **`inference/`**: Features the **Multiverse Engine** implementation, a high-performance inference server optimized for Multiverse models.

For detailed documentation and usage instructions, please refer to the README.md files in each directory.

## 📝 Todo List

- [ ] Add evaluation code based on lighteval
- [ ] Support context parallelism
