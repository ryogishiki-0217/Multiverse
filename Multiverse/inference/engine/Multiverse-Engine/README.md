This repository contains the official implementation of **Multiverse Engine**,  which is built up from the [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/tree/357fb2dba5543a3b40607ac43acc2582331b930c) codebase to support inference for **Multiverse Models**. For more details, please refer to our research paper:

## ðŸš€ Installation

To set up the environment, create a new conda environment and then run the following installation script.

```bash
conda create -n multiverse python=3.11
conda activate multiverse

git clone https://github.com/Multiverse4FM/Multiverse-Engine
cd Multiverse-Engine
bash install.sh
```


## âœ¨ Quick Start

The usage of Multiverse Engine is identical to the SGLang workflow. See `example.py` for a simple demonstration.

The script accepts the following arguments:
* `--model_path`: The path to the base model on your local machine or from the Hugging Face Hub.
* `--prompts_path`: A path to a JSON file containing a list of prompts.

To run the quick start example:

```bash
cd example

python example.py \
  --model_path Multiverse4FM/Multiverse-32B \
  --prompts_dir ./prompt
```

This will load the model and generate responses for each prompt in the specified text file, leveraging the Multiverse capabilities defined for the model.



## ðŸš§ Issues

We are actively working on addressing the following known issues and areas for improvement:

* [ ]  **Support KV Cache Eviction :**: Currently, KV cache offloading and reloading mechanisms are not supported. To ensure correctness, we recommend limiting the batch size to 50 or fewer.
* [ ]  **Avoid Infinite Parallelism**: We are working on implementing safeguards against infinite-depth parallelism that may be introduced by the model itself.

To avoid potential issues during usage, we recommend setting a maximum timeout in your code to prevent infinite loops or extremely long generation times.
