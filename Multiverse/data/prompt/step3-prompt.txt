**Rewriting Task: Structured Parallel Reasoning Chain**

You are given a full reasoning structure inside a `<Parallel>` block, consisting of:
- one `<Goal>` block with multiple `<Outline>` elements,
- multiple `<Path>` blocks, and
- one `<Conclusion>` block.

Some `<Path>` blocks may include a **fully nested `<Parallel>...</Parallel>` block**. These nested blocks must be rewritten **recursively using the same rules**.


### General Instructions

- You must **preserve all XML tags exactly** as they appear — do **not** remove, rename, or reorder tags.
- Only modify the **inner text** of `<Outline>`, `<Path>`, and `<Conclusion>` blocks.
- Wrap the final output in a **single Markdown code block** using triple backticks.

### Rewriting Guidelines

#### For `<Goal>`:
- Rewrite each `<Outline>` into a **concise and standalone statement of what is being computed, determined, or found**.
- **Remove any references to intermediate steps, reasoning, or methods** — only the end goal should remain.

#### For each `<Path>`:
- Maintain the original numbering prefix (e.g., `1:`, `2:`).
- Rewrite the path into a **logically self-contained paragraph**.
- Do **not** use any transitional or comparative phrases (e.g., "First," "Next," "Alternatively," "On the other hand," etc.).

- **Critically important**:  
  - **Start by counting how many sentences appear in the original `<Path>` block.**
  - If the `<Path>` contains **five or fewer sentences**, rewrite them **together as a single coherent paragraph**, ensuring logical flow and fluency without using transitional phrases.
  - If the `<Path>` contains **more than five sentences**:
    - Rewrite the **first five sentences together as a single unit**, forming a fluent paragraph.
    - For the **remaining sentences**, **rewrite each one individually**, based on its meaning, as clear and fluent standalone statements.

- If a `<Path>` contains a **nested `<Parallel>` block**, treat that block recursively using the same rewriting procedure (including for its `<Goal>`, `<Path>`, and `<Conclusion>`).

#### For `<Conclusion>`:
- Rewrite this block into a **concise summary of the outcomes** across all `<Path>` blocks.
- You may combine or contrast final results, but avoid restating intermediate steps.


### Example Output Format

```
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: [concise description of the goal of Path 1]
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: [concise description of the goal of Path 2]
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: [self-contained paragraph for Path 1, rewritten sentence by sentence]
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1.1: [concise goal for subpath 1.1]
</Outline>
<Outline>
1.2: [concise goal for subpath 1.2]
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1.1: [rewritten paragraph for subpath 1.1]
</Path>
<Path>
1.2: [rewritten paragraph for subpath 1.2]
</Path>
<Conclusion>
[summarized results from subpaths 1.1 and 1.2]
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
</Path>
<Path>
2: [self-contained paragraph for Path 2, rewritten sentence by sentence]
</Path>
<Conclusion>
[summary of outcomes from Path 1 and Path 2]
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
```

### Summary

- Preserve tag structure exactly.
- For `<Path>`, rewrite based on sentence count:  
  - First 5 sentences as a group, make sure this path starts as a separte path without any cross-reference such as "First," "Next," "Alternatively," "On the other hand,".  
  - Remaining ones individually.
- Always rewrite sentence-by-sentence based on summary of meaning.
- Apply the same rules recursively to any nested `<Parallel>` blocks.
- Ensure clarity, logical completeness, and fluency without transitional phrases
