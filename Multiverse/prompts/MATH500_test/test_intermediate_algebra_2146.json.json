  "problem": "Let $P(x)$ be a quadratic polynomial with real coefficients satisfying $x^2 - 2x + 2 \\le P(x) \\le 2x^2 - 4x + 3$ for all real  numbers $x$, and suppose $P(11) = 181$. Find $P(16)$.",
  "solution": "Rewriting the given quadratics in vertex form, we have \\[1 + (x-1)^2 \\le P(x) \\le 1 + 2(x-1)^2.\\]Both of those quadratics have vertex at $(1, 1)$; considering the shape of the graph of a quadratic, we see that $P$ must also have its vertex at $(1,1)$. Therefore, \\[P(x) = 1 + k(x-1)^2\\]for some constant $k$. Setting $x = 11$, we have $181 = 1 +100k$, so $k = \\tfrac{9}{5}$. Then \\[P(16) = 1 + \\tfrac{9}{5} \\cdot 15^2 = \\boxed{406}.\\]",
