  "problem": "An investment of $\\$24,\\!000$ is made in a government bond that will pay $1\\%$ bi-monthly interest (meaning that the investment will increase by $1\\%$ every two months). At the end of five years, what is the total number of dollars in this investment?\n\nExpress your answer to the nearest whole number.",
  "solution": "Five years make sixty months, so interest will have been compounded 30 times. That means that the investment will have grown to $\\$24,\\!000 \\cdot 1.01^{30} \\approx \\boxed{\\$32,\\!348}$, to the nearest dollar.",
  "answer": "\\$32,\\!348",
