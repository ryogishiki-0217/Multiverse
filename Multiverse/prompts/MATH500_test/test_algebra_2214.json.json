  "problem": "The solution to $-4 < 2(x - 1) < 8$ is expressed in the form $a < x < b$. Find the value of $a + b$.",
  "solution": "Since everything in sight is even, we should begin by dividing by 2.  That gives \\[-2<x-1<4.\\] To isolate $x$, we add 1, so \\[-1<x<5.\\] Since $a=-1$ and $b=5$, we get $a+b=-1+5=\\boxed{4}$.",
