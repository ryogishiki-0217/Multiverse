  "problem": "The product of integers 240 and $k$ is a perfect cube. What is the smallest possible positive value of $k$?",
  "solution": "$240=2^4\\cdot3\\cdot5=2^3(2\\cdot3\\cdot5)$. For $240k$ to be a perfect cube (and not a perfect square), $k$ must be at least $2^2\\cdot3^2\\cdot5^2=\\boxed{900}$.",
