  "problem": "What integer $x$ satisfies $\\frac{1}{4}<\\frac{x}{7}<\\frac{1}{3}$?",
  "solution": "Multiplying all expressions in the inequalities by $7$, we have $\\frac74 < x < \\frac73$. Since $\\frac 74$ is between $1$ and $2$, and $\\frac 73$ is between $2$ and $3$, the only integer $x$ between these two fractions is $\\boxed{2}$.",
