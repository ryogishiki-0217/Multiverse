  "problem": "Two fair, 6-sided dice are thrown.  What is the probability that the product of the two numbers is a multiple of 5?  Express your answer as a common fraction.",
  "solution": "Probability questions are sometimes answered by calculating the ways the event will NOT happen, then subtracting.  In this problem the $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$ and $6$ faces are paired to create $5 \\times 5 = 25$ number pairs whose product is NOT multiples of 5.  This leaves $36 - 25 = 11$ ways to get a multiple of $5$, so the probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{11}{36}}$.",
  "answer": "\\frac{11}{36}",
