  "problem": "Suppose that $f$ is a polynomial such that \\[(x-1)\\cdot f(x)=3x^4+x^3 - 25x^2 +38x -17.\\]What is the degree of $f$?",
  "solution": "Since the product of $f$ and a polynomial with degree 1 equals a polynomial with degree 4, we know that $f$ is a polynomial with degree $4-1=\\boxed{3}$.",
