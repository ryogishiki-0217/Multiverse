  "problem": "Find all the integer roots of\n\\[x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0.\\]Enter all the integer roots, separated by commas.",
  "solution": "By the Integer Root Theorem, the possible integer roots are all the divisors of 14 (including negative divisors), which are $-14,$ $-7,$ $-2,$ $-1,$ $1,$ $2,$ $7,$ and $14.$  Checking, we find that the only integer roots are $\\boxed{-2,1}.$",
