  "problem": "Simplify $(u+4)(u-1) - (u-3)(u+6)$.",
  "solution": "Expanding the first product, the distribute property shows that  $$(u+4)(u-1) = u^2 + 4u - u - 4 = u^2 + 3u - 4.$$The second product becomes $$(u-3)(u+6) = u^2 - 3u + 6u - 18 = u^2 + 3u - 18.$$Subtracting, both the $u^2$ and the $3u$ terms cancel, leaving an answer of $-4 - (-18) = \\boxed{14}$.",
