  "problem": "Solve for the positive value of $x$ such that $\\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16$.",
  "solution": "We first cube each side of the equation to get $x^2 - 4x + 4 = 16^3$.  Notice that $x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x-2)^2.$\n\nTherefore, we have that $x-2 = \\pm 16^{3/2} = \\pm 64$.  Therefore, the possible values of $x$ are $-62$ and $66,$ and the only positive value is therefore $\\boxed{66}$.",
