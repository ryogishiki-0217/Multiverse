  "problem": "A triangle $\\triangle ABC$ with $\\angle A = 14^\\circ$ is inscribed in a circle where $AB$ is a diameter. How many degrees are in $\\angle B$?",
  "solution": "If $AB$ is a diameter, that means the triangle must have a right angle at $C.$ Therefore, we have that \\begin{align*}\n\\angle B &= 180^\\circ - (\\angle A + \\angle C) \\\\\n&= 180^\\circ - (14^\\circ + 90^\\circ) = \\boxed{76^\\circ}.\n\\end{align*}",
  "answer": "76^\\circ",
