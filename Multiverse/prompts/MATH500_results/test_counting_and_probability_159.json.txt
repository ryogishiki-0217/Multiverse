Okay, let's see. The problem is about arranging 5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 1 Independent around a circular table, with the condition that all members of each party sit next to each other. And they want to know how many different ways this can be done, considering that rotations of the same arrangement are not counted as different.
Hmm, circular permutations.
First, when dealing with circular arrangements, the number of permutations is generally less than linear arrangements because rotations are considered the same.
For example, arranging n distinct objects in a circle is (n-1)! I think.
But in this case, we have groups of people who have to stay together.
So the Democrats are a block, the Republicans are a block, and the Independent is a single person.
Wait, the Independent is alone, so that person has to sit alone as a block of one.
So essentially, we have three blocks: one Democrat block with 5 people, one Republican block with 5 people, and one Independent block with 1 person.
Since it's a circular table, the arrangement of these blocks matters.
But first, let's think about arranging the blocks.
In circular permutations, arrangements that can be rotated into each other are considered the same.
So, if we fix one block to break the circular symmetry, the number of ways to arrange the remaining blocks.
Let's fix the Independent block.
Since the table is circular, we can fix one person's position to avoid counting rotations multiple times.
So, let's fix the Independent in one seat.
Then, we need to arrange the two blocks (Democrats and Republicans) around the table.
But wait, once the Independent is fixed, the remaining seats are linear relative to the Independent, right?
Wait, actually, no.
If we fix one person's position in a circular arrangement, the number of distinct arrangements is (total seats - 1)! But here, the blocks have to stay together.
So perhaps treating each party as a single unit first, then multiplying by the permutations within each block.
Wait, maybe another approach.
Let's first consider the three blocks: D, R, and I.
Since they need to sit in a circle with all members of each party together, each party is a block.
So, the number of ways to arrange these three blocks around a circular table.
For circular arrangements, the number of distinct permutations is (number of items - 1)! if rotations are considered the same.
So here, with three blocks, it would be (3 - 1)! = 2! = 2 ways.
But wait, is that correct?
Wait, actually, when arranging k objects around a circular table where rotations are considered the same, the number of arrangements is (k - 1)! So in this case, with three blocks, the number of distinct circular arrangements is (3 - 1)! = 2! = 2.
But then, each block can be arranged internally in different ways.
For example, the Democrats can be arranged among themselves in 5! ways, same with the Republicans, and the Independent is just 1.
So, the total number would be the number of circular arrangements of the blocks multiplied by the product of the permutations within each block.
So that would be 2! * 5! * 5! * 1.
But wait, hold on.
Wait, maybe there's a different way to think about it.
Alternatively, we can think of string arrangements where the Democrats, Republicans, and Independent are blocks.
Because all members of each party must sit together, so we can treat each party as a single entity.
Then, arranging these entities around a circular table.
For linear arrangements, the number would be 3! * 5! *5! *1.
But since it's circular, we divide by 3 to account for rotations.
Wait, so 3! / 3 = 2, then multiplied by 5! *5!.
So that gives the same result: 2 *5! *5!.
Let me verify.
Suppose we have three blocks: D, R, I.
In a circle, the number of distinct arrangements considering rotations as the same.
The formula is (number of blocks - 1)! * (product of permutations within each block).
So here, (3 - 1)! * 5! *5! *1 = 2! *5! *5! = 2 *5! *5!.
So that seems correct.
But wait, another way to think about it is that if we fix one block to remove rotational symmetry, then arrange the others.
Let's fix the Independent block.
Since all members of a party have to sit together, the Independent is a block of 1.
So, fix the Independent in one position.
Then, we have the remaining two blocks (D and R) to arrange around the table.
Since the table is circular, after fixing one block, the remaining seats can be thought of as arranged in a circle.
Wait, but if we fix one block, say the Independent, then the remaining two blocks can be arranged in 2! ways.
Then, within each block, the members can be permuted.
So, total arrangements would be 2! *5! *5!.
That's the same result.
So both methods give the same answer.
So that's 2 *5! *5!.
But wait, let me make sure I'm not overcomplicating things.
Let's check another approach.
Suppose we first arrange the parties around the table.
Since it's circular, the number of ways to arrange the three parties is (3 - 1)! = 2! = 2.
Then, for each arrangement of parties, we can permute the members within each party's block.
Democrats: 5!, Republicans: 5!, Independent: 1.
So total arrangements would be 2 *5! *5!.
Alternatively, if we consider linear arrangements first.
If the table were linear (a line), the number of arrangements would be 3! (for the parties) *5! *5! *1.
But since it's a circular table, we have to divide by the number of people to account for rotational symmetry?
Wait, no.
For circular arrangements, when all seats are considered the same under rotation, the formula is different.
For linear arrangements, the answer would indeed be 3! *5! *5!.
But for circular arrangements with no fixed orientation, we need to divide by the number of seats.
Wait, but in circular permutations, the formula is usually (n - 1)! for distinct objects.
But here, we have blocks.
Wait, perhaps a better way is to consider the circular arrangement as equivalent to arranging them in a line where the first position is fixed.
So, fix one block to eliminate rotational symmetry, then arrange the rest.
That's the method we used earlier, giving 2! *5! *5!.
Alternatively, using the blocks method: treat each party as a block.
Then, arrange the three blocks around a circle.
The number of ways to arrange k blocks around a circular table is (k - 1)!.
So here, with three blocks, it's (3 - 1)! = 2!.
Then, each block can be permuted internally.
Democrats and Republicans can be permuted among themselves, so multiplied by 5! each, and the Independent is just 1.
So total arrangements are 2! *5! *5! *1 = 2 *5! *5!.
So that seems correct.
So this should be the answer.
But just to double-check, let's think of another analogy.
Suppose all Democrats are a single entity, Republicans a single entity, and Independent a single entity.
So total entities: 3.
Arranging 3 entities in a circle is 2! ways.
Then each entity can be internally permuted.
So answer is 2! * (5! * 5! * 1).
Yes, that makes sense.
Therefore, the answer is 2 *5! *5!.
Calculating that, 5! is 120, so 120 *120 = 14400, then multiplied by 2 is 28800.
So 28,800.
But wait, let me confirm this with another approach.
Suppose we first arrange the parties in a line: there are 3! = 6 ways to arrange the three parties.
Then, since it's a circular table, we divide by the number of parties to account for rotations, so 6 / 3 = 2.
Alternatively, using the formula for circular permutations which is (n - 1)! so 2!.
Then, for each of these arrangements, we can permute the members within the parties.
So 5! for Democrats, 5! for Republicans, and 1 for Independent.
So total arrangements: 2 *5! *5! = 2 *120 *120 = 28,800.
So that's the answer.
I think that's correct.
Let me check one more time.
Suppose we fix the Independent at a specific seat.
Then, we have two blocks left: Democrats and Republicans.
The number of ways to arrange these two blocks around the table is 2! (since two options).
Then, each block can be arranged internally in 5! ways.
So total is 2! *5! *5! = 2 *120 *120 = 28,800.
Yep, same answer.
So that's correct.
Therefore, the final answer is 28,800.
**Final Answer** 
\boxed{28800}
</Think>

Answer: To solve the problem of arranging 5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 1 Independent around a circular table such that all members of each party sit next to each other, we need to consider the following steps:

1. **Treat each party as a single block**: Since all members of each party must sit together, we can treat each party as a single block. This gives us three blocks: Democrats (D), Republicans (R), and Independent (I).

2. **Arrange the blocks around the circular table**: For circular arrangements, the number of distinct permutations of \( k \) blocks is \((k - 1)!\). Here, \( k = 3 \), so the number of ways to arrange the blocks is \((3 - 1)! = 2!\).

3. **Account for internal arrangements within each block**: 
   - The Democrats can be arranged among themselves in \(5!\) ways.
   - The Republicans can be arranged among themselves in \(5!\) ways.
   - The Independent is a single person and has \(1!\) way to arrange themselves.

4. **Calculate the total number of arrangements**: Multiply the number of ways to arrange the blocks by the number of ways to arrange the members within each block:
   \[
   2! \times 5! \times 5! \times 1!
   \]

5. **Perform the calculations**:
   - \(2! = 2\)
   - \(5! = 120\)
   - Total arrangements: \(2 \times 120 \times 120 = 28,800\)

Thus, the number of distinct ways to arrange the Senate committee members around the circular table, considering rotational symmetry and internal arrangements, is \(\boxed{28800}\).
