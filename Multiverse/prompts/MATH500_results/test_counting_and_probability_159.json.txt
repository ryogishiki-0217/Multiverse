Okay, so I need to solve this problem about arranging Senate committee members around a circular table.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: The problem statement, the composition of the committee, and the specific seating constraint.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: The definition of equivalent seatings due to rotations and the need for a distinct counting method.
</Outline>
<Outline>
3: The initial consideration of treating parties as blocks, the need for further arrangement within blocks, and the potential complication of identical party sizes.

<Path>
1: The problem involves a Senate committee consisting of 5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 1 Independent. The constraint is that all members of each party must sit next to each other.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The problem specifies that seatings equivalent under rotation are considered the same, which implies that arrangements must be counted distinctively in a circular permutation context.
</Path>
<Path>
3: But wait, first, maybe we can think of each party as a single block.
Since all members of each party have to sit together, that would mean we have three blocks: one Democrat block, one Republican block, and one Independent block.
Since it's a circular table, arranging blocks around the circle would have (3-1)! ways, which is 2! = 2 ways.
But then, each party block can be arranged internally in different ways.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
3.1: The number of internal arrangements for the Democrat block.
</Outline>
<Outline>
3.2: The number of internal arrangements for the Republican block.
</Outline>
<Outline>
3.3: The number of internal arrangements for the Independent block.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
3.1: The 5 Democrats can be arranged among themselves in 5! ways.
</Path>
<Path>
3.2: The 5 Republicans can be arranged among themselves in 5! ways.
</Path>
<Path>
3.3: The Independent block consists of a single person, so there's only 1 way to arrange that person.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The internal arrangements are 5! for Democrats, 5! for Republicans, and 1 for the Independent.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So, the total number of arrangements would be (3-1)! * (5! * 5! * 1).
That's 2! * 5! *5! = 2 * 120 * 120.
Wait, but hold on.
Let me make sure.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The problem involves seating 5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 1 Independent around a circular table, with all members of each party sitting together. Seatings that are rotations of each other are considered equivalent, necessitating a distinct counting method. An initial approach considers treating each party as a single block, which can be arranged in (3-1)! ways around the circular table, with internal arrangements of 5! for Democrats, 5! for Republicans, and 1 for the Independent.

1: The initial calculation for the total number of arrangements is (3-1)! multiplied by 5! for Democrats, 5! for Republicans, and 1 for the Independent, resulting in 2! * 5! * 5! = 2 * 120 * 120 = 28,800.

<Path>
2: The formula for arranging n items in a circle, which is (n-1)!, is recalled. This formula is considered for the 3 blocks (Democrats, Republicans, Independent).
</Path>
<Path>
3: The Independent block consists of a single person, leading to 1 way for internal arrangement.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The initial calculation yields 28,800 arrangements. The formula (n-1)! for circular permutations of blocks and the single internal arrangement for the Independent block are verified.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
But wait, is the (3-1)! the right way here?
Let me think again.
If the table is circular and rotations are considered the same.
So, when dealing with circular arrangements where rotations are considered equivalent, we fix one position to remove equivalent rotations.
So for three blocks, instead of linear arrangements which would be 3!, for circular arrangements it's (3-1)! = 2!.
Because rotating the blocks around the table doesn't create a new arrangement.
But in this case, the blocks are distinct: Democrats, Republicans, and Independent.
So the number of distinct circular arrangements of the blocks is (3-1)! = 2.
Then, multiplied by the internal arrangements.
But wait, another thought: If the table is circular, but the blocks are arranged around the table.
So fixing one block to account for the rotational symmetry.
So if we fix, say, the Independent block, then we have two blocks left (Democrats and Republicans) to arrange on either side of the Independent.
So that's 2! ways.
Then multiplied by the arrangements within each block.
So that also gives 2! *5! *5!.
So that's the same result.
So whether we do (3-1)! or think of fixing one block and arranging the rest, we get the same answer.
So I think that's correct.
But let me check with an example.
Let's think in parallel.

</Path>
<Path>
2: For a simplified scenario with 1 Democrat, 1 Republican, and 1 Independent, there is only 1 way to arrange the blocks around the circular table when considering rotationally equivalent arrangements. The internal arrangements for each party are 1! for Democrats, 1! for Republicans, and 1 for the Independent. The total number of arrangements is (3-1)! * 1! * 1! * 1 = 2 * 1 * 1 * 1 = 2, which corresponds to the two distinct seatings: D-R-I and D-I-R. This result appears inconsistent with the expectation of only 1 distinct seating.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The calculation for the simplified case with 2D, 2R, 1I yields 8 distinct arrangements, while the calculation for the simplified case with 1D, 1R, 1I yields 2 distinct arrangements, which seems to contradict the expectation of only 1 distinct seating.
</Conclusion>

Wait, but in reality, if you have three people: D, R, I sitting around a circular table.
If all rotations are considered the same.
Then the number of distinct arrangements is (3-1)! = 2.
But here, in our formula, when each party is a block.
But in this case, the parties are single people.
So the blocks are each just one person.
So arranging the three blocks around the table would be (3-1)! = 2 ways.
Then, since each "block" is just a single person, their internal arrangements are 1.
So total arrangements: 2 *1 *1 *1 = 2.
But actually, for three distinct people around a circular table, the number of distinct arrangements is (3-1)! = 2.
Which is correct.
But why here it's 2 and not 1?
Well, because even though it's circular, the people are distinct.
So, for example, if you have D, R, I around the table.
Starting with D, then R, then I is one arrangement.
Starting with D, then I, then R is another.
But these are the only two because after that, you can't get another unique rotation.
So that does make sense.
So in that example, our formula holds.
But in the original problem, we have three blocks: one big Democrat block, one big Republican block, and one Independent.
So the number of ways to arrange these three blocks around the table is (3-1)! = 2.
Then, within the Democrat block, there are 5! ways to arrange the Democrats.
Similarly, 5! for Republicans, and 1 for the Independent.
So total arrangements should be 2 *5! *5!.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: The calculation of total arrangements using the (n-1)! formula.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: The calculation of total arrangements using the block-fixing method.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The total arrangements are calculated using the formula 2 * 5! * 5!, which equals 2 * 120 * 120 = 28,800.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The block-fixing method is applied, where one block is fixed to account for rotational symmetry. With the Independent block fixed, the two remaining blocks (Democrats and Republicans) can be arranged in 2! ways. This approach also yields a total of 2! * 5! * 5! arrangements.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
Both the (n-1)! formula and the block-fixing method result in a total of 28,800 distinct seating arrangements.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So I think that's correct.
But to confirm, let me check another way.
Alternatively, if we imagine that the circular table has fixed positions labeled from 1 to 11, then the total number of arrangements would be different because rotations would not be considered the same.
But since the problem states that rotations are considered the same, we need to divide by the number of seats?
Wait, but in this problem, the total number of seats is 5 +5 +1 =11.
However, since all members of each party must sit together, the arrangement is effectively three blocks: D, R, I, each of which is a contiguous block.
So when arranging blocks around a circular table with 11 seats, but the blocks have lengths 5, 5, and 1.
But wait, the actual number of seats is 11, but since they must all sit together, each party is a block.
So the problem reduces to arranging three blocks around a circular table, which is indeed (3-1)! =2, then multiplying by the internal arrangements.
Alternatively, if the table is circular with 11 seats, and we need to arrange the parties such that each party sits in a block, then we can fix one party to break the circular symmetry.
For example, fix the Independent person.
Since there's only one Independent, their position is unique.
Then, arrange the two party blocks (Democrats and Republicans) in the remaining seats.
But wait, if we fix the Independent person, then we have two blocks left to arrange on either side.
The number of ways to arrange two blocks is 2! =2.
Then, multiply by the number of ways to arrange the members within the Democrat and Republican blocks, which is 5! each.
So total arrangements: 2 *5! *5!.
That's the same answer.
Alternatively, if we don't fix the Independent, then we have to arrange three blocks (D, R, I) around the table, which for a circular arrangement is (3-1)! =2! ways, then multiply by internal arrangements.
But if the Independent is a block of 1, their position can be anywhere, so perhaps another way to think about it is:
First, arrange the Democrats, Republicans, and Independent as blocks.
Since circular table, fix one block to eliminate rotational symmetry.
Say, fix the Democrat block.
Then, arrange the remaining two blocks (Republican and Independent) around them.
The number of ways to arrange two blocks is 2!.
But within the Democrat block, the 5 members can be arranged in 5! ways, similarly for Republicans.
The Independent block is just 1 way.
So total arrangements: 2 *5! *5!.
Same answer.
Therefore, regardless of how we look at it, the answer is 2*5!*5! which is 2*120*120=28,800.
Therefore, I think that is the correct answer.
But just to make sure, let me check once more.
Suppose we think of the problem linearly first, without considering rotations.
So, if the seats were in a line, how many arrangements?
We have three blocks: D, R, I.
Each block can be arranged internally in 5!, 5!, and 1 way.
The number of ways to arrange the three blocks in a line is 3! =6.
Then, total linear arrangements would be 3! *5! *5!.
However, in a circular table, arrangements that can be rotated into each other are considered the same.
So to adjust from linear to circular, we need to divide by the number of seats for the circular table.
Wait, but in this case, the circular table has 11 seats, but since the blocks are of lengths 5,5,1, the arrangement is fixed in terms of their positions.
Wait, perhaps another approach is to use the formula for circular arrangements with restricted movement.
But I think that's more complicated here.
Alternatively, in a circular arrangement with 11 seats, the number of distinct ways to arrange the three blocks (considering rotations as the same) is equivalent to arranging the blocks in (3-1)! ways.
Then multiplying by the internal arrangements.
But why is that?
Well, when you have a circular arrangement with blocks, and rotations are considered the same, then the number of distinct arrangements is like arranging the blocks in a line, but considering that rotating the blocks doesn't create a new arrangement.
So, fixing one block to account for the rotation, you arrange the remaining blocks.
So if there are three blocks, fixing one block, you can arrange the remaining two in 2! ways.
Which is (3-1)! =2.
Then multiply by the internal arrangements.
So that's another confirmation.
Therefore, the answer should be 2*5!*5! =28,800.
So, I think that is correct.
**Final Answer**
the final answer is \boxed{28800}
</Think>

Answer: To solve the problem of arranging 5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 1 Independent around a circular table such that all members of each party sit next to each other, we need to consider the following steps:

1. **Treat each party as a single block**: Since all members of each party must sit together, we can initially treat each party as a single block. This gives us three blocks: Democrats, Republicans, and Independents.

2. **Arrange the blocks around the circular table**: For circular arrangements, the number of distinct arrangements of \( n \) blocks is \((n - 1)!\). Here, we have 3 blocks, so the number of distinct arrangements is \((3 - 1)! = 2!\).

3. **Arrange the members within each block**: 
   - The 5 Democrats can be arranged among themselves in \(5!\) ways.
   - The 5 Republicans can be arranged among themselves in \(5!\) ways.
   - The Independent is a single person and can be arranged in \(1\) way.

4. **Calculate the total number of arrangements**: 
   - The number of ways to arrange the blocks is \(2!\).
   - Multiply this by the internal arrangements of each block: \(5!\) for Democrats, \(5!\) for Republicans, and \(1\) for the Independent.

Thus, the total number of distinct arrangements is:
\[
2! \times 5! \times 5! = 2 \times 120 \times 120 = 28,800
\]

Therefore, the final answer is \(\boxed{28800}\).

if the table is circular and rotations are considered the same.
so, when dealing with circular arrangements where rotations are considered equivalent, we fix one position to remove equivalent rotations.

wait, but in reality, if you have three people: d, r, i sitting around a circular table.
if all rotations are considered the same.
then the number of distinct arrangements is (3-1)! = 2.
but here, in our formula, when each party is a block.
but in this case, the parties are single people.
so the blocks are each just one person.
so arranging the three blocks around the table would be (3-1)! = 2 ways.
then, since each "block" is just a single person, their internal arrangements are 1.
so total arrangements: 2 *1 *1 *1 = 2.
but actually, for three distinct people around a circular table, the number of distinct arrangements is (3-1)! = 2.
which is correct.
but why here it's 2 and not 1?
well, because even though it's circular, the people are distinct.
so, for example, if you have d, r, i around the table.
starting with d, then r, then i is one arrangement.
starting with d, then i, then r is another.
but these are the only two because after that, you can't get another unique rotation.
so that does make sense.
so in that example, our formula holds.
but in the original problem, we have three blocks: one big democrat block, one big republican block, and one independent.
so the number of ways to arrange these three blocks around the table is (3-1)! = 2.
then, within the democrat block, there are 5! ways to arrange the democrats.
similarly, 5! for republicans, and 1 for the independent.
so total arrangements should be 2 *5! *5!.

so i think that's correct.
but to confirm, let me check another way.
alternatively, if we imagine that the circular table has fixed positions labeled from 1 to 11, then the total number of arrangements would be different because rotations would not be considered the same.
but since the problem states that rotations are considered the same, we need to divide by the number of seats?
wait, but in this problem, the total number of seats is 5 +5 +1 =11.
however, since all members of each party must sit together, the arrangement is effectively three blocks: d, r, i, each of which is a contiguous block.
so when arranging blocks around a circular table with 11 seats, but the blocks have lengths 5, 5, and 1.
but wait, the actual number of seats is 11, but since they must all sit together, each party is a block.
so the problem reduces to arranging three blocks around a circular table, which is indeed (3-1)! =2, then multiplying by the internal arrangements.
alternatively, if the table is circular with 11 seats, and we need to arrange the parties such that each party sits in a block, then we can fix one party to break the circular symmetry.
for example, fix the independent person.
since there's only one independent, their position is unique.
then, arrange the two party blocks (democrats and republicans) in the remaining seats.
but wait, if we fix the independent person, then we have two blocks left to arrange on either side.
the number of ways to arrange two blocks is 2! =2.
then, multiply by the number of ways to arrange the members within the democrat and republican blocks, which is 5! each.
so total arrangements: 2 *5! *5!.
that's the same answer.
alternatively, if we don't fix the independent, then we have to arrange three blocks (d, r, i) around the table, which for a circular arrangement is (3-1)! =2! ways, then multiply by internal arrangements.
but if the independent is a block of 1, their position can be anywhere, so perhaps another way to think about it is:
first, arrange the democrats, republicans, and independent as blocks.
since circular table, fix one block to eliminate rotational symmetry.
say, fix the democrat block.
then, arrange the remaining two blocks (republican and independent) around them.
the number of ways to arrange two blocks is 2!.
but within the democrat block, the 5 members can be arranged in 5! ways, similarly for republicans.
the independent block is just 1 way.
so total arrangements: 2 *5! *5!.
same answer.
therefore, regardless of how we look at it, the answer is 2*5!*5! which is 2*120*120=28,800.
therefore, i think that is the correct answer.
but just to make sure, let me check once more.
suppose we think of the problem linearly first, without considering rotations.
so, if the seats were in a line, how many arrangements?
we have three blocks: d, r, i.
each block can be arranged internally in 5!, 5!, and 1 way.
the number of ways to arrange the three blocks in a line is 3! =6.
then, total linear arrangements would be 3! *5! *5!.
however, in a circular table, arrangements that can be rotated into each other are considered the same.
so to adjust from linear to circular, we need to divide by the number of seats for the circular table.
wait, but in this case, the circular table has 11 seats, but since the blocks are of lengths 5,5,1, the arrangement is fixed in terms of their positions.
wait, perhaps another approach is to use the formula for circular arrangements with restricted movement.
but i think that's more complicated here.
alternatively, in a circular arrangement with 11 seats, the number of distinct ways to arrange the three blocks (considering rotations as the same) is equivalent to arranging the blocks in (3-1)! ways.
then multiplying by the internal arrangements.
but why is that?
well, when you have a circular arrangement with blocks, and rotations are considered the same, then the number of distinct arrangements is like arranging the blocks in a line, but considering that rotating the blocks doesn't create a new arrangement.
so, fixing one block to account for the rotation, you arrange the remaining blocks.
so if there are three blocks, fixing one block, you can arrange the remaining two in 2! ways.
which is (3-1)! =2.
then multiply by the internal arrangements.
so that's another confirmation.
therefore, the answer should be 2*5!*5! =28,800.
so, i think that is correct.
**final answer**
the final answer is \boxed{28800}

answer: to solve the problem of arranging 5 democrats, 5 republicans, and 1 independent around a circular table such that all members of each party sit next to each other, we need to consider the following steps:

1. **treat each party as a single block**: since all members of each party must sit together, we can initially treat each party as a single block. this gives us three blocks: democrats, republicans, and independents.

2. **arrange the blocks around the circular table**: for circular arrangements, the number of distinct arrangements of \( n \) blocks is \((n - 1)!\). here, we have 3 blocks, so the number of distinct arrangements is \((3 - 1)! = 2!\).

3. **arrange the members within each block**: 
   - the 5 democrats can be arranged among themselves in \(5!\) ways.
   - the 5 republicans can be arranged among themselves in \(5!\) ways.
   - the independent is a single person and can be arranged in \(1\) way.

4. **calculate the total number of arrangements**: 
   - the number of ways to arrange the blocks is \(2!\).
   - multiply this by the internal arrangements of each block: \(5!\) for democrats, \(5!\) for republicans, and \(1\) for the independent.

thus, the total number of distinct arrangements is:
\[
2! \times 5! \times 5! = 2 \times 120 \times 120 = 28,800
\]

therefore, the final answer is \(\boxed{28800}\)
