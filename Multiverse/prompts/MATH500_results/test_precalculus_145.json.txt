Okay, so I need to find a vector v such that when I cross it with the vector [1; 2; -5], I get [90; 30; 30].
And not just any vector, but the one with the smallest magnitude.
Since there are infinitely many solutions, I have to find the minimal one.
First, I remember that the cross product of two vectors a and b is given by a formula involving the components.
Let me recall that if a = [a1; a2; a3] and b = [b1; b2; b3], then a × b is the vector [a2b3 - a3b2; a3b1 - a1b3; a1b2 - a2b1].
But in this case, we have a × v = c, where a is [1; 2; -5] and c is [90; 30; 30].
I need to solve for v.
Let me denote v as [v1; v2; v3].
Then, setting up the cross product equation:
[1; 2; -5] × [v1; v2; v3] = [ (2*v3 - (-5)*v2); ((-5)*v1 - 1*v3); (1*v2 - 2*v1) ] = [90; 30; 30]
So component-wise, we have:
1) 2v3 + 5v2 = 90
2) -5v1 - v3 = 30
3) v2 - 2v1 = 30
So that gives us a system of three equations.
But wait, we have three variables (v1, v2, v3) and three equations.
Hmm, but wait, cross product equations can have no solution, infinite solutions, etc.
But the problem states there are an infinite number of vectors.
Wait, maybe because we have three equations in three variables?
Let me check the equations again.
Wait, actually, cross product a × v = c.
If a and c are given, then v can be found if and only if a ⋅ c = 0, because the cross product is orthogonal to both a and c.
Let me verify that.
The cross product a × v is orthogonal to both a and v.
So, if a × v = c, then c must be orthogonal to a.
Let me check if a ⋅ c = 0.
Compute the dot product of [1; 2; -5] and [90; 30; 30].
That is 1*90 + 2*30 + (-5)*30 = 90 + 60 - 150 = 0.
Okay, so that's good.
So that means there is a solution.
Otherwise, if the dot product wasn't zero, there would be no solution.
But since it's zero, solutions exist.
But since the system is underdetermined or what?
Wait, we have three variables and three equations, so potentially we can solve uniquely for v1, v2, v3.
But the problem says there are an infinite number of vectors v.
Wait, that's conflicting with three equations for three variables.
Maybe not?
Wait, but cross product equations can sometimes result in dependent equations.
Let me check the equations again.
Let's write them out:
1) 2v3 + 5v2 = 90
2) -5v1 - v3 = 30
3) v2 - 2v1 = 30
So, equations 1, 2, 3.
Let me see if these equations are independent.
Let me try to solve this system.
Starting with equation 3: v2 = 2v1 + 30.
So we can express v2 in terms of v1.
Then from equation 2: -5v1 - v3 = 30 ⇒ v3 = -5v1 - 30.
Then substitute v2 and v3 into equation 1:
2*(-5v1 - 30) + 5*(2v1 + 30) = 90
Let's compute that:
2*(-5v1) + 2*(-30) + 5*(2v1) + 5*30 = -10v1 -60 +10v1 +150 = (-10v1 +10v1) + (-60 +150) = 0v1 +90 = 90
So equation 1 reduces to 90 = 90, which is always true.
So equation 1 is redundant.
Therefore, we have only two independent equations (equations 2 and 3) and thus one degree of freedom.
But wait, equations 2 and 3 are:
From equation 3: v2 = 2v1 + 30
From equation 2: v3 = -5v1 -30
But then equation 1 is automatically satisfied.
Therefore, the general solution is v1 is free, v2 = 2v1 +30, v3 = -5v1 -30.
So the vector v can be written as [v1; 2v1 +30; -5v1 -30].
So if we let v1 = t, a parameter, then:
v(t) = [t; 2t +30; -5t -30]
So the general solution is v(t) = t*[1; 2; -5] + [0; 30; -30].
Wait, let me check that.
If I separate the terms involving t:
v(t) = [t; 2t; -5t] + [0; 30; -30] = t*[1; 2; -5] + [0; 30; -30]
So that suggests that the solutions are of the form v = w + k*a, where w is a particular solution and k is a scalar.
Wait, in cross product equations, if a × v = c, then the general solution is v = v_p + k*a, where v_p is a particular solution and k is any scalar.
Let me recall that.
Suppose we have a × v = c.
Then, if we have two solutions v1 and v2, then a × (v1 - v2) = a × v1 - a × v2 = c - c = 0.
So a is orthogonal to (v1 - v2).
But since a is orthogonal to (v1 - v2), then (v1 - v2) must be parallel to a, right?
Because if the cross product is zero, then the vectors are parallel.
Wait, no, if a × (v1 - v2) = 0, then a and (v1 - v2) are parallel.
So that means that v1 - v2 = s*a for some scalar s.
Hence, the general solution is v = v_p + s*a.
So in our case, the particular solution v_p can be found, and then the general solution is v_p + s*a.
So here, the particular solution would be [0; 30; -30], and then adding s*[1; 2; -5].
Wait, but let's check if that's correct.
Let me compute a × v_p:
a × v_p = [1; 2; -5] × [0; 30; -30]
Compute the cross product:
i (2*(-30) - (-5)*30) - j (1*(-30) - (-5)*0) + k (1*30 - 2*0)
Compute each component:
First component: 2*(-30) - (-5)*30 = -60 +150 = 90
Second component: - (1*(-30) - (-5)*0) = - (-30) = 30
Third component: 1*30 - 2*0 = 30
So a × v_p = [90; 30; 30] which is c.
So that's correct.
Therefore, v_p = [0; 30; -30] is indeed a particular solution.
Then the general solution is v = v_p + s*a = [0; 30; -30] + s*[1; 2; -5].
So as s varies, we get different solutions.
Therefore, the general solution is:
v(t) = [s; 30 + 2s; -30 -5s]
Which is the same as what I had before, where t = s.
Therefore, the general solution is parametrized by s.
Now, we need to find the vector v(t) with the smallest magnitude.
So we need to minimize the magnitude ||v(t)|| = sqrt(s2 + (30 + 2s)2 + (-30 -5s)2).
Instead of minimizing the square root, it's easier to minimize the square of the magnitude:
f(s) = ||v(t)||2 = s2 + (30 + 2s)2 + (-30 -5s)2
Let's expand this:
First term: s2
Second term: (30 + 2s)^2 = 900 + 120s + 4s2
Third term: (-30 -5s)^2 = (30 +5s)^2 = 900 + 300s + 25s2
So adding them up:
f(s) = s2 + 900 + 120s +4s2 +900 +300s +25s2
Combine like terms:
s2 +4s2 +25s2 = 30s2
120s +300s = 420s
900 +900 = 1800
So f(s) = 30s2 + 420s + 1800
Now, to find the minimum of this quadratic function, we can take the derivative and set it to zero.
The derivative f'(s) = 60s +420
Setting to zero: 60s +420 = 0 ⇒ 60s = -420 ⇒ s = -7.
So the minimum occurs at s = -7.
Let me check the second derivative to confirm it's a minimum.
The second derivative f''(s) =60 >0, so yes, it's a minimum.
Therefore, the vector v with the smallest magnitude is obtained by plugging s = -7 into v(s):
v(-7) = [ -7; 30 +2*(-7); -30 -5*(-7) ]
Compute each component:
First component: -7
Second component: 30 + (-14) = 16
Third component: -30 +35 = 5
Therefore, v(-7) = [-7; 16; 5]
Let's check the magnitude:
||v(-7)|| = sqrt((-7)^2 +16^2 +5^2) = sqrt(49 +256 +25) = sqrt(330) ≈ 18.165...
But just to make sure, let's verify that this vector does satisfy the original cross product equation.
Compute a × v(-7) = [1; 2; -5] × [-7; 16; 5]
Compute the cross product:
i component: 2*5 - (-5)*16 = 10 +80 =90
j component: - (1*5 - (-5)*(-7)) = - (5 -35) = - (-30) =30
k component: 1*16 -2*(-7) =16 +14=30
So the cross product is [90;30;30], which matches c.
So that's correct.
Therefore, the vector v with the smallest magnitude is [-7;16;5], and its magnitude is sqrt(330).
But the problem asks to provide the answer in the boxed format.
Let me check the components again.
First component: s = -7.
Second component: 30 + 2*(-7)=30 -14=16.
Third component: -30 -5*(-7)= -30 +35=5.
Yes, that's correct.
Therefore, the final answer is \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\ 16 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}}.
**Final Answer**
\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\ 16 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}}

Answer: To find the vector \(\mathbf{v}\) with the smallest magnitude such that \[\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix} \times \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 90 \\ 30 \\ 30 \end{pmatrix},\] we start by setting up the cross product equations. Let \(\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{pmatrix}\). The cross product equations are:

1. \(2v_3 + 5v_2 = 90\)
2. \(-5v_1 - v_3 = 30\)
3. \(v_2 - 2v_1 = 30\)

From equation 3, we solve for \(v_2\): \(v_2 = 2v_1 + 30\). From equation 2, we solve for \(v_3\): \(v_3 = -5v_1 - 30\). Substituting \(v_2\) and \(v_3\) into equation 1, we verify that it reduces to an identity (90 = 90), confirming the system has infinite solutions dependent on \(v_1\).

We express \(\mathbf{v}\) in terms of a parameter \(s\): \(\mathbf{v}(s) = \begin{pmatrix} s \\ 2s + 30 \\ -5s - 30 \end{pmatrix}\). This can be written as \(\mathbf{v}(s) = s \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 30 \\ -30 \end{pmatrix}\).

To minimize the magnitude of \(\mathbf{v}(s)\), we find the value of \(s\) that minimizes \(\|\mathbf{v}(s)\|\). The magnitude squared is \(30s^2 + 420s + 1800\). Taking the derivative and setting it to zero, we find \(s = -7\).

Substituting \(s = -7\) back into \(\mathbf{v}(s)\), we get: \[\mathbf{v}(-7) = \begin{pmatrix} -7 \\ 16 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.\]

Verifying this solution, we compute the cross product and confirm it matches the given vector. Thus, the vector \(\mathbf{v}\) with the smallest magnitude is \(\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\ 16 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}}\).

okay, so i need to find a vector v such that when i cross it with the vector [1; 2; -5], i get [90; 30; 30].
and not just any vector, but the one with the smallest magnitude.
since there are infinitely many solutions, i have to find the minimal one.
first, i remember that the cross product of two vectors a and b is given by a formula involving the components.
let me recall that if a = [a1; a2; a3] and b = [b1; b2; b3], then a × b is the vector [a2b3 - a3b2; a3b1 - a1b3; a1b2 - a2b1].
but in this case, we have a × v = c, where a is [1; 2; -5] and c is [90; 30; 30].
i need to solve for v.
let me denote v as [v1; v2; v3].
then, setting up the cross product equation:
[1; 2; -5] × [v1; v2; v3] = [ (2*v3 - (-5)*v2); ((-5)*v1 - 1*v3); (1*v2 - 2*v1) ] = [90; 30; 30]
so component-wise, we have:
1) 2v3 + 5v2 = 90
2) -5v1 - v3 = 30
3) v2 - 2v1 = 30
so that gives us a system of three equations.
but wait, we have three variables (v1, v2, v3) and three equations.
hmm, but wait, cross product equations can have no solution, infinite solutions, etc.
but the problem states there are an infinite number of vectors.

if a and c are given, then v can be found if and only if a ⋅ c = 0, because the cross product is orthogonal to both a and c.
let me verify that.
the cross product a × v is orthogonal to both a and v.
so, if a × v = c, then c must be orthogonal to a.
let me check if a ⋅ c = 0.
compute the dot product of [1; 2; -5] and [90; 30; 30].
that is 1*90 + 2*30 + (-5)*30 = 90 + 60 - 150 = 0.
okay, so that's good.
so that means there is a solution.
otherwise, if the dot product wasn't zero, there would be no solution.
but since it's zero, solutions exist.
but since the system is underdetermined or what?
wait, we have three variables and three equations, so potentially we can solve uniquely for v1, v2, v3.

1) 2v3 + 5v2 = 90

starting with equation 3: v2 = 2v1 + 30.
so we can express v2 in terms of v1.
then from equation 2: -5v1 - v3 = 30 ⇒ v3 = -5v1 - 30.
then substitute v2 and v3 into equation 1:
2*(-5v1 - 30) + 5*(2v1 + 30) = 90
let's compute that:
2*(-5v1) + 2*(-30) + 5*(2v1) + 5*30 = -10v1 -60 +10v1 +150 = (-10v1 +10v1) + (-60 +150) = 0v1 +90 = 90
so equation 1 reduces to 90 = 90, which is always true.
so equation 1 is redundant.
therefore, we have only two independent equations (equations 2 and 3) and thus one degree of freedom.
but wait, equations 2 and 3 are:
from equation 3: v2 = 2v1 + 30
from equation 2: v3 = -5v1 -30
but then equation 1 is automatically satisfied.
therefore, the general solution is v1 is free, v2 = 2v1 +30, v3 = -5v1 -30.
so the vector v can be written as [v1; 2v1 +30; -5v1 -30].
so if we let v1 = t, a parameter, then:
v(t) = [t; 2t +30; -5t -30]
so the general solution is v(t) = t*[1; 2; -5] + [0; 30; -30].
wait, let me check that.
if i separate the terms involving t:
v(t) = [t; 2t; -5t] + [0; 30; -30] = t*[1; 2; -5] + [0; 30; -30]
so that suggests that the solutions are of the form v = w + k*a, where w is a particular solution and k is a scalar.
wait, in cross product equations, if a × v = c, then the general solution is v = v_p + k*a, where v_p is a particular solution and k is any scalar.
let me recall that.
suppose we have a × v = c.
then, if we have two solutions v1 and v2, then a × (v1 - v2) = a × v1 - a × v2 = c - c = 0.
so a is orthogonal to (v1 - v2).
but since a is orthogonal to (v1 - v2), then (v1 - v2) must be parallel to a, right?
because if the cross product is zero, then the vectors are parallel.
wait, no, if a × (v1 - v2) = 0, then a and (v1 - v2) are parallel.
so that means that v1 - v2 = s*a for some scalar s.
hence, the general solution is v = v_p + s*a.
so in our case, the particular solution v_p can be found, and then the general solution is v_p + s*a.
so here, the particular solution would be [0; 30; -30], and then adding s*[1; 2; -5].
wait, but let's check if that's correct.
let me compute a × v_p:
a × v_p = [1; 2; -5] × [0; 30; -30]
compute the cross product:
i (2*(-30) - (-5)*30) - j (1*(-30) - (-5)*0) + k (1*30 - 2*0)
compute each component:
first component: 2*(-30) - (-5)*30 = -60 +150 = 90
second component: - (1*(-30) - (-5)*0) = - (-30) = 30
third component: 1*30 - 2*0 = 30
so a × v_p = [90; 30; 30] which is c.
so that's correct.
therefore, v_p = [0; 30; -30] is indeed a particular solution.
then the general solution is v = v_p + s*a = [0; 30; -30] + s*[1; 2; -5].
so as s varies, we get different solutions.
therefore, the general solution is:
v(t) = [s; 30 + 2s; -30 -5s]
which is the same as what i had before, where t = s.
therefore, the general solution is parametrized by s.
now, we need to find the vector v(t) with the smallest magnitude.
so we need to minimize the magnitude ||v(t)|| = sqrt(s2 + (30 + 2s)2 + (-30 -5s)2).
instead of minimizing the square root, it's easier to minimize the square of the magnitude:
f(s) = ||v(t)||2 = s2 + (30 + 2s)2 + (-30 -5s)2
let's expand this:
first term: s2
second term: (30 + 2s)^2 = 900 + 120s + 4s2
third term: (-30 -5s)^2 = (30 +5s)^2 = 900 + 300s + 25s2
so adding them up:
f(s) = s2 + 900 + 120s +4s2 +900 +300s +25s2
combine like terms:
s2 +4s2 +25s2 = 30s2
120s +300s = 420s
900 +900 = 1800
so f(s) = 30s2 + 420s + 1800
now, to find the minimum of this quadratic function, we can take the derivative and set it to zero.
the derivative f'(s) = 60s +420
setting to zero: 60s +420 = 0 ⇒ 60s = -420 ⇒ s = -7.
so the minimum occurs at s = -7.
let me check the second derivative to confirm it's a minimum.
the second derivative f''(s) =60 >0, so yes, it's a minimum.
therefore, the vector v with the smallest magnitude is obtained by plugging s = -7 into v(s):
v(-7) = [ -7; 30 +2*(-7); -30 -5*(-7) ]
compute each component:
first component: -7
second component: 30 + (-14) = 16
third component: -30 +35 = 5
therefore, v(-7) = [-7; 16; 5]
let's check the magnitude:
||v(-7)|| = sqrt((-7)^2 +16^2 +5^2) = sqrt(49 +256 +25) = sqrt(330) ≈ 18.165...
but just to make sure, let's verify that this vector does satisfy the original cross product equation.
compute a × v(-7) = [1; 2; -5] × [-7; 16; 5]
compute the cross product:
i component: 2*5 - (-5)*16 = 10 +80 =90
j component: - (1*5 - (-5)*(-7)) = - (5 -35) = - (-30) =30
k component: 1*16 -2*(-7) =16 +14=30
so the cross product is [90;30;30], which matches c.
so that's correct.
therefore, the vector v with the smallest magnitude is [-7;16;5], and its magnitude is sqrt(330).
but the problem asks to provide the answer in the boxed format.
let me check the components again.
first component: s = -7.
second component: 30 + 2*(-7)=30 -14=16.
third component: -30 -5*(-7)= -30 +35=5.
yes, that's correct.
therefore, the final answer is \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\ 16 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}}.

answer: to find the vector \(\mathbf{v}\) with the smallest magnitude such that \[\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix} \times \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 90 \\ 30 \\ 30 \end{pmatrix},\] we start by setting up the cross product equations. let \(\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{pmatrix}\). the cross product equations are:

1. \(2v_3 + 5v_2 = 90\)
2. \(-5v_1 - v_3 = 30\)
3. \(v_2 - 2v_1 = 30\)

from equation 3, we solve for \(v_2\): \(v_2 = 2v_1 + 30\). from equation 2, we solve for \(v_3\): \(v_3 = -5v_1 - 30\). substituting \(v_2\) and \(v_3\) into equation 1, we verify that it reduces to an identity (90 = 90), confirming the system has infinite solutions dependent on \(v_1\).

we express \(\mathbf{v}\) in terms of a parameter \(s\): \(\mathbf{v}(s) = \begin{pmatrix} s \\ 2s + 30 \\ -5s - 30 \end{pmatrix}\). this can be written as \(\mathbf{v}(s) = s \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 30 \\ -30 \end{pmatrix}\).

to minimize the magnitude of \(\mathbf{v}(s)\), we find the value of \(s\) that minimizes \(\|\mathbf{v}(s)\|\). the magnitude squared is \(30s^2 + 420s + 1800\). taking the derivative and setting it to zero, we find \(s = -7\).

substituting \(s = -7\) back into \(\mathbf{v}(s)\), we get: \[\mathbf{v}(-7) = \begin{pmatrix} -7 \\ 16 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.\]

verifying this solution, we compute the cross product and confirm it matches the given vector. thus, the vector \(\mathbf{v}\) with the smallest magnitude is \(\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\ 16 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}}\)
