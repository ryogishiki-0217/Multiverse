Okay, let me try to solve this problem. So, we have a right triangle ABC, with angle B being 90 degrees. That means it's a right-angled triangle at B, so A and C are the other two angles. The problem states that sin A equals 2 cos A, and we need to find tan A.
Hmm, okay. Let's recall some trigonometric identities. In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the length of the opposite side over the hypotenuse, cosine is the adjacent side over the hypotenuse, and tangent is opposite over adjacent. Also, tan A is sin A / cos A. Wait, that might be helpful here.
Given that sin A = 2 cos A, maybe I can use that to find tan A directly. Let me try.
If sin A = 2 cos A, then if we divide both sides by cos A, we get sin A / cos A = 2. But sin A / cos A is tan A, so that would mean tan A = 2. Whoa, is that really it? Let me see. Yeah, because if sin A = 2 cos A, then dividing both sides by cos A gives tan A = 2. So is the answer 2? Let me confirm this.
Wait, maybe I should do it step by step to make sure. Alternatively, let's denote the sides. Let me call the triangle with right angle at B, so the sides are: the hypotenuse is AC, and the legs are AB and BC. Angle A is at vertex A, so the opposite side is BC, and adjacent side is AB. Therefore: sin A = BC / AC cos A = AB / AC tan A = BC / AB
Given sin A = 2 cos A. So, substituting the side lengths: BC / AC = 2 * (AB / AC) => BC = 2 AB
Therefore, BC = 2 AB. Then, tan A = BC / AB = (2 AB) / AB = 2. Yes, so that also gives tan A = 2. So same result. So whether I use the trigonometric identity directly or use the sides, the answer is 2. Let me check again if I made a mistake. Sometimes when dealing with trig ratios, especially in right triangles, if the setup is wrong, it can lead to errors. But here angle B is the right angle, so the sides opposite and adjacent to angle A are correct. Opposite is BC and adjacent is AB, hypotenuse is AC. Yes. So if sin A = BC / AC and cos A = AB / AC. If BC / AC = 2 * (AB / AC), then BC = 2 AB, so tan A = BC / AB = 2 AB / AB = 2. Yep, so seems correct. Alternatively, another way: since sin A = 2 cos A, squaring both sides, (sin A)^2 = 4 (cos A)^2. Then, using (sin A)^2 + (cos A)^2 = 1. So substitute: 4 (cos A)^2 + (cos A)^2 = 1 => 5 (cos A)^2 = 1 => (cos A)^2 = 1/5 => cos A = 1/√5. Then sin A = 2 cos A = 2 / √5. Then tan A = sin A / cos A = (2 / √5) / (1 / √5) = 2. So again, same answer. Therefore, getting consistent results through different methods. So the answer should be 2. Hmm, but the problem says "Solve the following math problem: In right triangle ABC with angle B = 90 degrees...", which is straightforward. The question is what is tan A given sin A =2 cos A. So yes, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe check with values. Suppose we have a triangle where the sides are such that BC =2 and AB=1. Then tan A is 2/1=2, sin A =2 / sqrt(1^2 +2^2)=2 / sqrt(5), and cos A =1 / sqrt(5). Then 2 cos A =2*(1 / sqrt(5))=2/sqrt(5)= sin A, which holds. So this satisfies the given condition. Thus, in such a triangle, tan A is 2, which matches our calculation. Therefore, all checks out. Therefore, the answer is 2.
the final answer is \boxed{2}

Answer: Given a right triangle \(ABC\) with \(\angle B = 90^\circ\), we know \(\sin A = 2 \cos A\). We need to find \(\tan A\).

First, recall the trigonometric identities for a right triangle:
- \(\sin A = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\)
- \(\cos A = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\)
- \(\tan A = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}\)

Given \(\sin A = 2 \cos A\), we can divide both sides by \(\cos A\) (assuming \(\cos A \neq 0\)):
\[
\frac{\sin A}{\cos A} = 2
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\tan A = 2
\]

To verify, we can consider the sides of the triangle. Let the sides be \(AB\), \(BC\), and \(AC\) (hypotenuse). For \(\angle A\):
- \(\sin A = \frac{BC}{AC}\)
- \(\cos A = \frac{AB}{AC}\)

Given \(\sin A = 2 \cos A\), substituting the sides gives:
\[
\frac{BC}{AC} = 2 \cdot \frac{AB}{AC} \implies BC = 2AB
\]

Thus, \(\tan A = \frac{BC}{AB} = \frac{2AB}{AB} = 2\).

Alternatively, using the Pythagorean identity \(\sin^2 A + \cos^2 A = 1\):
- If \(\sin A = 2 \cos A\), then \((2 \cos A)^2 + \cos^2 A = 1\)
- \(4 \cos^2 A + \cos^2 A = 1 \implies 5 \cos^2 A = 1 \implies \cos A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\)
- \(\sin A = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}\)
- \(\tan A = \frac{\sin A}{\cos A} = \frac{\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}}{\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}} = 2\)

All methods confirm that \(\tan A = 2\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{2}\).

given sin a = 2 cos a. so, substituting the side lengths: bc / ac = 2 * (ab / ac) => bc = 2 ab
therefore, bc = 2 ab. then, tan a = bc / ab = (2 ab) / ab = 2. yes, so that also gives tan a = 2. so same result. so whether i use the trigonometric identity directly or use the sides, the answer is 2. let me check again if i made a mistake. sometimes when dealing with trig ratios, especially in right triangles, if the setup is wrong, it can lead to errors. but here angle b is the right angle, so the sides opposite and adjacent to angle a are correct. opposite is bc and adjacent is ab, hypotenuse is ac. yes. so if sin a = bc / ac and cos a = ab / ac. if bc / ac = 2 * (ab / ac), then bc = 2 ab, so tan a = bc / ab = 2 ab / ab = 2. yep, so seems correct. alternatively, another way: since sin a = 2 cos a, squaring both sides, (sin a)^2 = 4 (cos a)^2. then, using (sin a)^2 + (cos a)^2 = 1. so substitute: 4 (cos a)^2 + (cos a)^2 = 1 => 5 (cos a)^2 = 1 => (cos a)^2 = 1/5 => cos a = 1/√5. then sin a = 2 cos a = 2 / √5. then tan a = sin a / cos a = (2 / √5) / (1 / √5) = 2. so again, same answer. therefore, getting consistent results through different methods. so the answer should be 2. hmm, but the problem says "solve the following math problem: in right triangle abc with angle b = 90 degrees...", which is straightforward. the question is what is tan a given sin a =2 cos a. so yes, seems correct. alternatively, maybe check with values. suppose we have a triangle where the sides are such that bc =2 and ab=1. then tan a is 2/1=2, sin a =2 / sqrt(1^2 +2^2)=2 / sqrt(5), and cos a =1 / sqrt(5). then 2 cos a =2*(1 / sqrt(5))=2/sqrt(5)= sin a, which holds. so this satisfies the given condition. thus, in such a triangle, tan a is 2, which matches our calculation. therefore, all checks out. therefore, the answer is 2.

answer: given a right triangle \(abc\) with \(\angle b = 90^\circ\), we know \(\sin a = 2 \cos a\). we need to find \(\tan a\).

first, recall the trigonometric identities for a right triangle:
- \(\sin a = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\)
- \(\cos a = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\)
- \(\tan a = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}\)

given \(\sin a = 2 \cos a\), we can divide both sides by \(\cos a\) (assuming \(\cos a \neq 0\)):
\[
\frac{\sin a}{\cos a} = 2
\]
this simplifies to:
\[
\tan a = 2
\]

to verify, we can consider the sides of the triangle. let the sides be \(ab\), \(bc\), and \(ac\) (hypotenuse). for \(\angle a\):
- \(\sin a = \frac{bc}{ac}\)
- \(\cos a = \frac{ab}{ac}\)

given \(\sin a = 2 \cos a\), substituting the sides gives:
\[
\frac{bc}{ac} = 2 \cdot \frac{ab}{ac} \implies bc = 2ab
\]

thus, \(\tan a = \frac{bc}{ab} = \frac{2ab}{ab} = 2\).

alternatively, using the pythagorean identity \(\sin^2 a + \cos^2 a = 1\):
- if \(\sin a = 2 \cos a\), then \((2 \cos a)^2 + \cos^2 a = 1\)
- \(4 \cos^2 a + \cos^2 a = 1 \implies 5 \cos^2 a = 1 \implies \cos a = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\)
- \(\sin a = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}\)
- \(\tan a = \frac{\sin a}{\cos a} = \frac{\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}}{\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}} = 2\)

all methods confirm that \(\tan a = 2\).

the final answer is \(\boxed{2}\)
