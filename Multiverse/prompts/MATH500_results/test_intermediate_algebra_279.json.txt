Okay, so I need to factor the polynomial \(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\) into irreducible monic polynomials with integer coefficients and then find the sum of the values of each of these polynomials at \(x = 1\).
Hmm, let me start by trying to factor this polynomial.
The given polynomial is \(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\).
First, maybe I can use substitution to simplify the polynomial.
Let me set \(y = x^4\).
Then the polynomial becomes \(y^2 + 3y - 4\).
That looks quadratic, which is easier to factor.
Let's try factoring that.
So, quadratic in y is \(y^2 + 3y - 4\).
I need two numbers that multiply to -4 and add up to 3.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>

1: Determine the factors of the constant term (-4) for the quadratic expression \(y^2 + 3y - 4\).
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: Determine the factors of the leading coefficient (1) for the quadratic expression \(y^2 + 3y - 4\).
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The constant term of the quadratic expression \(y^2 + 3y - 4\) is -4. The factors of -4 are identified as ±1, ±2, and ±4.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The leading coefficient of the quadratic expression \(y^2 + 3y - 4\) is 1, and its only factors are 1 and -1.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The factors of the constant term (-4) are ±1, ±2, and ±4, while the factors of the leading coefficient (1) are 1 and -1.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Possible factors are (y + 4)(y - 1) or (y +1)(y -4).
Let's check:
(y +4)(y -1) = y^2 +3y -4.
Yes, that's correct because 4* -1 = -4 and 4 -1 =3.
Similarly, (y +1)(y -4) would be y^2 -3y -4, which is not our polynomial.
So, it's (y +4)(y -1).
Therefore, substituting back \(x^4\) for y, the polynomial factors as:
\((x^4 +4)(x^4 -1)\).
So, original polynomial factors into \(x^8 +3x^4 -4 = (x^4 +4)(x^4 -1)\).
But wait, the problem says that each \(p_i(x)\) is monic, with integer coefficients, and cannot be factored further over the integers.
So, I need to check if these factors \(x^4 +4\) and \(x^4 -1\) are irreducible over the integers.
Let me check \(x^4 -1\) first.
That looks like it can be factored further.
Let's think in parallel.

1: The polynomial \(x^4 - 1\) is examined for irreducibility. It is recognized as a difference of squares, \(x^4 - 1 = (x^2)^2 - 1^2\), which factors into \((x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1)\). The factor \(x^2 - 1\) is further factorable as a difference of squares, \(x^2 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)\). The factor \(x^2 + 1\) is irreducible over the integers because it cannot be factored into polynomials of lower degree with integer coefficients. Consequently, \(x^4 - 1\) fully factors into \((x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)\), and it is therefore reducible.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The irreducibility of the polynomial \(x^4 + 4\) over the integers is examined. The polynomial \(x^4 + 4\) does not have any rational roots, as its constant term is 4 and the leading coefficient is 1, meaning any rational root would need to be a divisor of 4. None of the potential rational roots ±1, ±2, or ±4 satisfy the equation \(x^4 + 4 = 0\).
The possibility of \(x^4 + 4\) being factorable as a product of two quadratic polynomials is considered. An attempt is made to express \(x^4 + 4\) in the form \((x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d)\), where \(a, b, c,\) and \(d\) are integers.
The product of the two quadratic polynomials is expanded: \((x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d) = x^4 + (a+c)x^3 + (ac+b+d)x^2 + (ad+bc)x + bd\).
This expansion is equated to \(x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x + 4\), leading to a system of equations: \(a + c = 0\), \(ac + b + d = 0\), \(ad + bc = 0\), and \(bd = 4\).
The equation \(a + c = 0\) implies \(c = -a\).
Substituting \(c = -a\) into the second equation, \(a(-a) + b + d = -a^2 + b + d = 0\), yields \(b + d = a^2\).
The system of equations is now simplified to \(b + d = a^2\) and \(ad + bc = 0\), along with \(bd = 4\).
The equation \(ad + bc = 0\) is rewritten using \(c = -a\), resulting in \(ad + b(-a) = a(d - b) = 0\).
This implies that either \(a = 0\) or \(d - b = 0\).
If \(a = 0\), then \(c = 0\), and the equations become \(b + d = 0\) and \(bd = 4\). The system \(b + d = 0\) and \(bd = 4\) is analyzed. If \(b + d = 0\), then \(d = -b\), leading to the equation \(b(-b) = -b^2 = 4\), which simplifies to \(b^2 = -4\). This equation has no real solutions, and therefore no integer solutions.
If \(d - b = 0\), then \(d = b\), and the equations become \(2b = a^2\) and \(b^2 = 4\).
The equation \(b^2 = 4\) yields \(b = 2\) or \(b = -2\).
If \(b = 2\), then \(2(2) = a^2\) implies \(a^2 = 4\), so \(a = 2\) or \(a = -2\).
If \(b = -2\), then \(2(-2) = a^2\) implies \(a^2 = -4\), which has no real solutions.
Therefore, the possible integer solutions occur when \(b = 2\) and \(a = 2\) or \(a = -2\).
If \(a = 2\), then \(c = -2\), and \(d = b = 2\). This leads to the factorization \((x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\).
If \(a = -2\), then \(c = 2\), and \(d = b = 2\). This also leads to the factorization \((x^2 - 2x + 2)(x^2 + 2x + 2)\), which is the same as the previous factorization.
Thus, the polynomial \(x^4 + 4\) factors into \((x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\) over the integers.
Therefore, \(x^4 + 4\) is reducible over the integers.
The factorization of \(x^4 + 4\) is \((x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\).
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The polynomial \(x^4 - 1\) is reducible over the integers, factoring into \((x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)\). The polynomial \(x^4 + 4\) is also reducible over the integers, factoring into \((x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\).
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Therefore, the complete factorization so far is:
\(x^8 +3x^4 -4 = (x^4 +4)(x^4 -1) = (x^2 +2x +2)(x^2 -2x +2)(x^2 +1)(x -1)(x +1)\).

1: The quadratic polynomial \(x^2 + 1\) is examined for irreducibility. It does not possess any real roots, as the equation \(x^2 + 1 = 0\) implies \(x^2 = -1\), which has no real solutions. Consequently, \(x^2 + 1\) is irreducible over the integers.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The irreducibility of the quadratic polynomial \(x^2 - 2x + 2\) over the integers is investigated. It is observed that this polynomial does not have any rational roots. An attempt is made to factor it into linear factors, which would require finding integers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \((x + a)(x + b) = x^2 + (a + b)x + ab = x^2 - 2x + 2\). This implies that \(a + b = -2\) and \(ab = 2\). The integer pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy \(ab = 2\) are \((1, 2)\), \((-1, -2)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((-2, -1)\). None of these pairs sum to \(-2\). Therefore, the polynomial \(x^2 - 2x + 2\) cannot be factored further over the integers and is irreducible.
</Path>
<Path>
3: The quadratic polynomial \(x^2 + 2x + 2\) is tested for reducibility. Its discriminant is \(2^2 - 4(1)(2) = 4 - 8 = -4\), which is negative. This negative discriminant indicates that the polynomial has no real roots and therefore cannot be factored into linear polynomials with real coefficients, let alone integer coefficients. Consequently, \(x^2 + 2x + 2\) is irreducible over the integers.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The quadratic polynomials \(x^2 + 1\), \(x^2 - 2x + 2\), and \(x^2 + 2x + 2\) are all irreducible over the integers.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Similarly, \(x^2 -2x +2\) also has discriminant \((-2)^2 -4(1)(2) =4 -8 =-4\), which is negative, so no real roots, hence irreducible.
Similarly, \(x^2 +2x +2\) has discriminant \(2^2 -4(1)(2) =4 -8 =-4\), also negative, so irreducible.
The linear factors \(x -1\) and \(x +1\) are obviously irreducible.
Therefore, the complete factorization into irreducible monic polynomials with integer coefficients is:
\(x^8 +3x^4 -4 = (x^2 +2x +2)(x^2 -2x +2)(x^2 +1)(x -1)(x +1)\).
So, the factors are \(x^2 +2x +2\), \(x^2 -2x +2\), \(x^2 +1\), \(x -1\), and \(x +1\).
Now, the problem asks for the sum of the values of each of these polynomials at \(x =1\).
So, I need to compute each \(p_i(1)\) and then add them up.

So, adding them up: 7 +1 +2 +0 +2 =12.

Wait, hold on, this adds up to 5 +1 +2 +0 +2 =10, not 12.
So why did I previously think it was 12?
Wait, I must have miscalculated before.
So, correct evaluations:
1. \(x^2 +2x +2\) at x=1: 1 +2 +2 =5
2. \(x^2 -2x +2\) at x=1:1 -2 +2=1
3. \(x^2 +1\) at x=1:1 +1=2
4. \(x -1\) at x=1:1 -1=0
5. \(x +1\) at x=1:1 +1=2
So total sum is 5 +1 +2 +0 +2 =10.
Wait, but now I get 10.
So where did I go wrong originally?
Hmm, in my initial calculation, I must have messed up.
Let me check again.
Yes, let's double-check each evaluation step-by-step.
First polynomial: \(x^2 +2x +2\).
At x=1:
1^2 =1,
2*1=2,
So 1 +2 +2=5.
Correct.
Second polynomial: \(x^2 -2x +2\).
At x=1:
1^2=1,
-2*1= -2,
So 1 -2 +2=1.
Correct.
Third polynomial: \(x^2 +1\).
At x=1:1 +1=2.
Correct.
Fourth polynomial: \(x -1\).
At x=1: 1 -1=0.
Correct.
Fifth polynomial: \(x +1\).
At x=1:1 +1=2.
Correct.
Adding them up:5 +1 +2 +0 +2 =10.
So the sum is 10.
Wait, but in my first thought I wrote that the answer is 12, but as I re-calculated, it's 10.
There must be a mistake either in the factorization or in this evaluation.
Let me check the factorization again.
Original polynomial: \(x^8 +3x^4 -4\).

</Path>
<Path>
2: The factorization of \(x^4 + 4\) into \((x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\) is verified. The product of these quadratics is \((x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\). Expanding this product yields \(x^4 - 2x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x^3 - 4x^2 + 4x + 2x^2 - 4x + 4\). Combining like terms results in \(x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x + 4\), which simplifies to \(x^4 + 4\), confirming the factorization.

<Conclusion>
The factorization of \(x^4 - 1\) into \((x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)\) and the factorization of \(x^4 + 4\) into \((x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\) are both verified as correct.

</Parallel>
Therefore, original polynomial:
\((x^4 +4)(x^4 -1) = (x^2 +2x +2)(x^2 -2x +2)(x^2 +1)(x -1)(x +1)\).
So factorization is correct.
Therefore, the evaluation at x=1 for each factor is indeed:
5,1,2,0,2.
Adding to 10.
But why did I think it was 12 initially?
Maybe because when first adding in my mind, I may have miscalculated one of them.
But now after careful calculation, sum is 10.
Let me check with actual numbers once more.
Take each polynomial:
1. \(x^2 +2x +2\): 1 +2 +2=5.
2. \(x^2 -2x +2\):1 -2 +2=1.
3. \(x^2 +1\):1 +1=2.
4. \(x -1\):1 -1=0.
5. \(x +1\):1 +1=2.
5 +1 +2 +0 +2=10.
Yep, that's correct.
Therefore, the answer is 10.
Wait, but before finalizing, just to double-check if there's another possible factorization I missed.
But all the quadratic polynomials with negative discriminant are irreducible over integers, right?
\(x^2 +1\): no real roots, irreducible.
\(x^2 +2x +2\): discriminant is 4 -8= -4.
\(x^2 -2x +2\): discriminant 4 -8= -4.
So both irreducible.
And linear factors are irreducible.
So the factorization is complete.
Alternatively, is there another way to factor this polynomial?

</Path>
<Conclusion>
The method of factoring \(x^4 + 4\) as a difference of squares is not applicable because the polynomial is a sum. Factoring it as a sum of squares, \(x^4 + 4 = (x^2 + 2)^2 - (2x)^2\), correctly yields the factorization \((x^2 - 2x + 2)(x^2 + 2x + 2)\).

So that's the same factorization.

Yes, definitely 10.
So where did I go wrong when I first thought the answer was 12?
Probably a momentary miscalculation in adding the numbers.
But anyway, now I'm certain the correct answer is 10.
**Final Answer**
\boxed{10}
</Think>

Answer: To solve the problem, we need to factor the polynomial \(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\) into irreducible monic polynomials with integer coefficients and then compute the sum of the values of each of these polynomials at \(x = 1\).

First, we substitute \(y = x^4\) to simplify the polynomial, transforming it into \(y^2 + 3y - 4\). Factoring this quadratic polynomial, we get:
\[
y^2 + 3y - 4 = (y + 4)(y - 1)
\]
Substituting back \(x^4\) for \(y\), we have:
\[
x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 = (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1)
\]

Next, we factor \(x^4 - 1\) further. Recognizing it as a difference of squares, we get:
\[
x^4 - 1 = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1) = (x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)
\]

Now, we factor \(x^4 + 4\). We use the difference of squares method:
\[
x^4 + 4 = x^4 + 4x^2 + 4 - 4x^2 = (x^2 + 2)^2 - (2x)^2 = (x^2 + 2 - 2x)(x^2 + 2 + 2x) = (x^2 - 2x + 2)(x^2 + 2x + 2)
\]

Combining all factors, the complete factorization of the polynomial is:
\[
x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)(x^2 + 1)(x - 1)(x + 1)
\]

Each factor is irreducible over the integers. We now evaluate each factor at \(x = 1\):
- \(x^2 + 2x + 2\) at \(x = 1\): \(1 + 2 + 2 = 5\)
- \(x^2 - 2x + 2\) at \(x = 1\): \(1 - 2 + 2 = 1\)
- \(x^2 + 1\) at \(x = 1\): \(1 + 1 = 2\)
- \(x - 1\) at \(x = 1\): \(1 - 1 = 0\)
- \(x + 1\) at \(x = 1\): \(1 + 1 = 2\)

Summing these values, we get:
\[
5 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 2 = 10
\]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]

<conclusion>
the factors of the constant term (-4) are ±1, ±2, and ±4, while the factors of the leading coefficient (1) are 1 and -1.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
possible factors are (y + 4)(y - 1) or (y +1)(y -4).
let's check:
(y +4)(y -1) = y^2 +3y -4.
yes, that's correct because 4* -1 = -4 and 4 -1 =3.
similarly, (y +1)(y -4) would be y^2 -3y -4, which is not our polynomial.
so, it's (y +4)(y -1).
therefore, substituting back \(x^4\) for y, the polynomial factors as:
\((x^4 +4)(x^4 -1)\).
so, original polynomial factors into \(x^8 +3x^4 -4 = (x^4 +4)(x^4 -1)\).
but wait, the problem says that each \(p_i(x)\) is monic, with integer coefficients, and cannot be factored further over the integers.
so, i need to check if these factors \(x^4 +4\) and \(x^4 -1\) are irreducible over the integers.
let me check \(x^4 -1\) first.
that looks like it can be factored further.

1: the polynomial \(x^4 - 1\) is examined for irreducibility. it is recognized as a difference of squares, \(x^4 - 1 = (x^2)^2 - 1^2\), which factors into \((x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1)\). the factor \(x^2 - 1\) is further factorable as a difference of squares, \(x^2 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)\). the factor \(x^2 + 1\) is irreducible over the integers because it cannot be factored into polynomials of lower degree with integer coefficients. consequently, \(x^4 - 1\) fully factors into \((x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)\), and it is therefore reducible.
</path>
<path>
2: the irreducibility of the polynomial \(x^4 + 4\) over the integers is examined. the polynomial \(x^4 + 4\) does not have any rational roots, as its constant term is 4 and the leading coefficient is 1, meaning any rational root would need to be a divisor of 4. none of the potential rational roots ±1, ±2, or ±4 satisfy the equation \(x^4 + 4 = 0\).
the possibility of \(x^4 + 4\) being factorable as a product of two quadratic polynomials is considered. an attempt is made to express \(x^4 + 4\) in the form \((x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d)\), where \(a, b, c,\) and \(d\) are integers.
the product of the two quadratic polynomials is expanded: \((x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d) = x^4 + (a+c)x^3 + (ac+b+d)x^2 + (ad+bc)x + bd\).
this expansion is equated to \(x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x + 4\), leading to a system of equations: \(a + c = 0\), \(ac + b + d = 0\), \(ad + bc = 0\), and \(bd = 4\).
the equation \(a + c = 0\) implies \(c = -a\).
substituting \(c = -a\) into the second equation, \(a(-a) + b + d = -a^2 + b + d = 0\), yields \(b + d = a^2\).
the system of equations is now simplified to \(b + d = a^2\) and \(ad + bc = 0\), along with \(bd = 4\).
the equation \(ad + bc = 0\) is rewritten using \(c = -a\), resulting in \(ad + b(-a) = a(d - b) = 0\).
this implies that either \(a = 0\) or \(d - b = 0\).
if \(a = 0\), then \(c = 0\), and the equations become \(b + d = 0\) and \(bd = 4\). the system \(b + d = 0\) and \(bd = 4\) is analyzed. if \(b + d = 0\), then \(d = -b\), leading to the equation \(b(-b) = -b^2 = 4\), which simplifies to \(b^2 = -4\). this equation has no real solutions, and therefore no integer solutions.
if \(d - b = 0\), then \(d = b\), and the equations become \(2b = a^2\) and \(b^2 = 4\).
the equation \(b^2 = 4\) yields \(b = 2\) or \(b = -2\).
if \(b = 2\), then \(2(2) = a^2\) implies \(a^2 = 4\), so \(a = 2\) or \(a = -2\).
if \(b = -2\), then \(2(-2) = a^2\) implies \(a^2 = -4\), which has no real solutions.
therefore, the possible integer solutions occur when \(b = 2\) and \(a = 2\) or \(a = -2\).
if \(a = 2\), then \(c = -2\), and \(d = b = 2\). this leads to the factorization \((x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\).
if \(a = -2\), then \(c = 2\), and \(d = b = 2\). this also leads to the factorization \((x^2 - 2x + 2)(x^2 + 2x + 2)\), which is the same as the previous factorization.
thus, the polynomial \(x^4 + 4\) factors into \((x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\) over the integers.
therefore, \(x^4 + 4\) is reducible over the integers.
the factorization of \(x^4 + 4\) is \((x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\).
</path>
<conclusion>
the polynomial \(x^4 - 1\) is reducible over the integers, factoring into \((x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)\). the polynomial \(x^4 + 4\) is also reducible over the integers, factoring into \((x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\).
</conclusion>
</parallel>
therefore, the complete factorization so far is:
\(x^8 +3x^4 -4 = (x^4 +4)(x^4 -1) = (x^2 +2x +2)(x^2 -2x +2)(x^2 +1)(x -1)(x +1)\).

</path>
<path>
2: the irreducibility of the quadratic polynomial \(x^2 - 2x + 2\) over the integers is investigated. it is observed that this polynomial does not have any rational roots. an attempt is made to factor it into linear factors, which would require finding integers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \((x + a)(x + b) = x^2 + (a + b)x + ab = x^2 - 2x + 2\). this implies that \(a + b = -2\) and \(ab = 2\). the integer pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy \(ab = 2\) are \((1, 2)\), \((-1, -2)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((-2, -1)\). none of these pairs sum to \(-2\). therefore, the polynomial \(x^2 - 2x + 2\) cannot be factored further over the integers and is irreducible.

<path>
3: the quadratic polynomial \(x^2 + 2x + 2\) is tested for reducibility. its discriminant is \(2^2 - 4(1)(2) = 4 - 8 = -4\), which is negative. this negative discriminant indicates that the polynomial has no real roots and therefore cannot be factored into linear polynomials with real coefficients, let alone integer coefficients. consequently, \(x^2 + 2x + 2\) is irreducible over the integers.

<conclusion>
the quadratic polynomials \(x^2 + 1\), \(x^2 - 2x + 2\), and \(x^2 + 2x + 2\) are all irreducible over the integers.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
similarly, \(x^2 -2x +2\) also has discriminant \((-2)^2 -4(1)(2) =4 -8 =-4\), which is negative, so no real roots, hence irreducible.
similarly, \(x^2 +2x +2\) has discriminant \(2^2 -4(1)(2) =4 -8 =-4\), also negative, so irreducible.
the linear factors \(x -1\) and \(x +1\) are obviously irreducible.
therefore, the complete factorization into irreducible monic polynomials with integer coefficients is:
\(x^8 +3x^4 -4 = (x^2 +2x +2)(x^2 -2x +2)(x^2 +1)(x -1)(x +1)\).
so, the factors are \(x^2 +2x +2\), \(x^2 -2x +2\), \(x^2 +1\), \(x -1\), and \(x +1\).
now, the problem asks for the sum of the values of each of these polynomials at \(x =1\).
so, i need to compute each \(p_i(1)\) and then add them up.

wait, hold on, this adds up to 5 +1 +2 +0 +2 =10, not 12.
so why did i previously think it was 12?
wait, i must have miscalculated before.
so, correct evaluations:
1. \(x^2 +2x +2\) at x=1: 1 +2 +2 =5
2. \(x^2 -2x +2\) at x=1:1 -2 +2=1
3. \(x^2 +1\) at x=1:1 +1=2
4. \(x -1\) at x=1:1 -1=0
5. \(x +1\) at x=1:1 +1=2
so total sum is 5 +1 +2 +0 +2 =10.
wait, but now i get 10.
so where did i go wrong originally?
hmm, in my initial calculation, i must have messed up.
let me check again.
yes, let's double-check each evaluation step-by-step.
first polynomial: \(x^2 +2x +2\).
at x=1:
1^2 =1,
2*1=2,
so 1 +2 +2=5.
correct.
second polynomial: \(x^2 -2x +2\).
at x=1:
1^2=1,
-2*1= -2,
so 1 -2 +2=1.
correct.
third polynomial: \(x^2 +1\).
at x=1:1 +1=2.
correct.
fourth polynomial: \(x -1\).
at x=1: 1 -1=0.
correct.
fifth polynomial: \(x +1\).
at x=1:1 +1=2.
correct.
adding them up:5 +1 +2 +0 +2 =10.
so the sum is 10.
wait, but in my first thought i wrote that the answer is 12, but as i re-calculated, it's 10.
there must be a mistake either in the factorization or in this evaluation.
let me check the factorization again.
original polynomial: \(x^8 +3x^4 -4\).

<conclusion>
the factorization of \(x^4 - 1\) into \((x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)\) and the factorization of \(x^4 + 4\) into \((x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\) are both verified as correct.

</parallel>
therefore, original polynomial:
\((x^4 +4)(x^4 -1) = (x^2 +2x +2)(x^2 -2x +2)(x^2 +1)(x -1)(x +1)\).
so factorization is correct.
therefore, the evaluation at x=1 for each factor is indeed:
5,1,2,0,2.
adding to 10.
but why did i think it was 12 initially?
maybe because when first adding in my mind, i may have miscalculated one of them.
but now after careful calculation, sum is 10.
let me check with actual numbers once more.
take each polynomial:
1. \(x^2 +2x +2\): 1 +2 +2=5.
2. \(x^2 -2x +2\):1 -2 +2=1.
3. \(x^2 +1\):1 +1=2.
4. \(x -1\):1 -1=0.
5. \(x +1\):1 +1=2.
5 +1 +2 +0 +2=10.
yep, that's correct.
therefore, the answer is 10.
wait, but before finalizing, just to double-check if there's another possible factorization i missed.
but all the quadratic polynomials with negative discriminant are irreducible over integers, right?
\(x^2 +1\): no real roots, irreducible.
\(x^2 +2x +2\): discriminant is 4 -8= -4.
\(x^2 -2x +2\): discriminant 4 -8= -4.
so both irreducible.
and linear factors are irreducible.
so the factorization is complete.

</path>
<conclusion>
the method of factoring \(x^4 + 4\) as a difference of squares is not applicable because the polynomial is a sum. factoring it as a sum of squares, \(x^4 + 4 = (x^2 + 2)^2 - (2x)^2\), correctly yields the factorization \((x^2 - 2x + 2)(x^2 + 2x + 2)\).

so that's the same factorization.
hence, all steps are correct.
therefore, sum is 10.
therefore, the answer is 10.
but let me just check once more in case there is an error in evaluation.
wait, hold on, when i evaluated the polynomials at x=1, perhaps i made a mistake.
wait, take x=1 in each polynomial:
1. \(x^2 +2x +2\):

x=1:1 -1=0.
5. \(x +1\):

5 +1 +2 +0 +2=10.
yes, definitely 10.
so where did i go wrong when i first thought the answer was 12?
probably a momentary miscalculation in adding the numbers.
but anyway, now i'm certain the correct answer is 10.
**final answer**
\boxed{10}
</think>

answer: to solve the problem, we need to factor the polynomial \(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\) into irreducible monic polynomials with integer coefficients and then compute the sum of the values of each of these polynomials at \(x = 1\).

first, we substitute \(y = x^4\) to simplify the polynomial, transforming it into \(y^2 + 3y - 4\). factoring this quadratic polynomial, we get:
\[
y^2 + 3y - 4 = (y + 4)(y - 1)
\]
substituting back \(x^4\) for \(y\), we have:
\[
x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 = (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1)
\]

next, we factor \(x^4 - 1\) further. recognizing it as a difference of squares, we get:
\[
x^4 - 1 = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1) = (x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)
\]

now, we factor \(x^4 + 4\). we use the difference of squares method:
\[
x^4 + 4 = x^4 + 4x^2 + 4 - 4x^2 = (x^2 + 2)^2 - (2x)^2 = (x^2 + 2 - 2x)(x^2 + 2 + 2x) = (x^2 - 2x + 2)(x^2 + 2x + 2)
\]

combining all factors, the complete factorization of the polynomial is:
\[
x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)(x^2 + 1)(x - 1)(x + 1)
\]

each factor is irreducible over the integers. we now evaluate each factor at \(x = 1\):
- \(x^2 + 2x + 2\) at \(x = 1\): \(1 + 2 + 2 = 5\)
- \(x^2 - 2x + 2\) at \(x = 1\): \(1 - 2 + 2 = 1\)
- \(x^2 + 1\) at \(x = 1\): \(1 + 1 = 2\)
- \(x - 1\) at \(x = 1\): \(1 - 1 = 0\)
- \(x + 1\) at \(x = 1\): \(1 + 1 = 2\)

summing these values, we get:
\[
5 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 2 = 10
\]

thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]
