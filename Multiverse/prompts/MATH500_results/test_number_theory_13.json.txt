The solvability of the congruence 14u ≡ 46 mod 100 is contingent upon the greatest common divisor of 14 and 100 dividing 46. This congruence can be equivalently stated in the form 14u - 100k = 46, where k is an integer.

So the equation becomes 14u - 100k = 46.
Let me write that down: 14u - 100k = 46.
Let me think. Since 2 divides 46, that's okay. Let me divide the entire equation by 2 to simplify: 7u - 50k = 23.
