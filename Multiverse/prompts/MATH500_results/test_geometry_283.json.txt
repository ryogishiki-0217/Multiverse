Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. The question is about finding the area of quadrilateral DBEF. Looking at the diagram, there are points A, B, C, D, E, and F. Coordinates are given for points A, B, and C. Let me note those down first:
- A is at (0, 6)
- B is at (0, 0)
- C is at (8, 0)
D is the midpoint of AB, and E is the midpoint of BC. So, let's find coordinates for D and E.
Calculating D: since it's the midpoint of AB. The coordinates of A are (0,6) and B are (0,0). The midpoint formula is ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2). So, D would be ((0 + 0)/2, (6 + 0)/2) = (0, 3).
Similarly, E is the midpoint of BC. Coordinates of B are (0,0) and C are (8,0). Applying the midpoint formula: ((0 + 8)/2, (0 + 0)/2) = (4, 0). So E is at (4, 0).
The quadrilateral in question is DBEF. So the vertices are D, B, E, and F. Wait, but F is another point. The diagram labels an F, which isn't a midpoint. Hmm, the problem didn't describe F, so maybe it's part of the figure. Looking back at the problem statement, they mention determining the area of quadrilateral DBEF. So points D, B, E, F form this quadrilateral. But we need coordinates for all these points to compute the area.
Wait, F is labeled in the diagram. Let me check if coordinates for F are given. The label says "F(8/3, 2)". Let me verify that. Wait, in the code, it says: label("$F$", F, SW); So the problem might not explicitly give the coordinates of F, but in the Asymptote code, the coordinates are specified. Let me check the Asymptote code for point F: F=(8/3,2); So in the diagram, F is at (8/3, 2). But wait, perhaps F is another midpoint or an intersection point? Let me see. The problem says D and E are midpoints, but F might be an intersection of some lines. In the diagram, it looks like F is the intersection of lines EA and DC. Let me confirm that. The diagram shows lines EA and DC intersecting at F. So, if we need to compute the coordinates of F, we can find the intersection of lines EA and DC.
Given points:
E is at (4,0) (midpoint of BC)
A is at (0,6)
So line EA connects (4,0) and (0,6)
Similarly, D is at (0,3) (midpoint of AB)
C is at (8,0)
So line DC connects (0,3) and (8,0)
Let me verify that. Wait, in the problem statement, it says "draw(EA) and draw(DC)". So lines EA and DC intersect at point F. Therefore, let's compute the coordinates of F by finding the intersection of lines EA and DC.
First, find equations for lines EA and DC.
Let's start with line EA: passing through E(4,0) and A(0,6).
The slope (m) is (6 - 0)/(0 - 4) = 6/-4 = -3/2.
So the equation using point-slope form from point E(4,0):
y - 0 = (-3/2)(x - 4)
y = (-3/2)x + 6
Equation 1: y = (-3/2)x + 6
Now, line DC: connecting D(0,3) and C(8,0).
Calculate the slope: m = (0 - 3)/(8 - 0) = (-3)/8 = -3/8
Using point D(0,3):
y - 3 = (-3/8)(x - 0)
y = (-3/8)x + 3
Equation 2: y = (-3/8)x + 3
Now, find the intersection point F by setting equations equal:
(-3/2)x + 6 = (-3/8)x + 3
Multiply both sides by 8 to eliminate denominators:
8*(-3/2 x) + 8*6 = 8*(-3/8 x) + 8*3
Simplify:
-12x + 48 = -3x + 24
Bring all terms to left side:
-12x + 48 + 3x - 24 = 0
-9x + 24 = 0
-9x = -24
x = -24 / (-9) = 24/9 = 8/3 ≈ 2.666...
So x = 8/3.
Now, substitute x = 8/3 into one of the equations, say Equation 1:
y = (-3/2)(8/3) + 6
Calculate:
First term: (-3/2)*(8/3) = (-24/6) = -4
So y = -4 + 6 = 2
Therefore, F is at (8/3, 2), which matches the Asymptote code. So the coordinates of F are (8/3, 2).
Now that we have all coordinates:
D: (0,3)
B: (0,0)
E: (4,0)
F: (8/3, 2)
We need to find the area of quadrilateral DBEF, with vertices D, B, E, F.
One way to compute the area is by using the Shoelace formula (Gauss's area formula), which allows calculating the area of a polygon when the coordinates of its vertices are known.
Shoelace formula: For polygon with vertices (x1,y1), (x2,y2), ..., (xn,yn), (x1,y1),
Area = |(1/2)[(sum from i=1 to n of (xi yi+1 - xi+1 yi)))]|
Let's list the coordinates of the quadrilateral DBEF in order:
D: (0,3)
B: (0,0)
E: (4,0)
F: (8/3, 2)
Then back to D: (0,3)
Apply the Shoelace formula:
First, list the coordinates in order:
1. (0,3)
2. (0,0)
3. (4,0)
4. (8/3, 2)
5. (0,3)
Now, compute the sum of xi yi+1 and subtract the sum of xi+1 yi, then take half the absolute value.
Compute the products:
First, calculate the products xi * yi+1:
1. 0 * 0 = 0 (D to B: (0,3) to (0,0): x1*y2=0*0=0)
2. 0 * 0 = 0 (B to E: (0,0) to (4,0): x2*y3=0*0=0)
3. 4 * 2 = 8 (E to F: (4,0) to (8/3,2): x3*y4=4*2=8)
4. (8/3) * 3 = 8 (F to D: (8/3,2) to (0,3): x4*y5=8/3*3=8)
Sum of xi*yi+1 = 0 + 0 + 8 + 8 = 16
Now, calculate the products xi+1 * yi:
1. 0 * 3 = 0 (B's x * D's y: 0*3=0)
2. 4 * 0 = 0 (E's x * B's y: 4*0=0)
3. (8/3) * 0 = 0 (F's x * E's y: 8/3*0=0)
4. 0 * 2 = 0 (D's x * F's y: 0*2=0)
Sum of xi+1*yi = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0
Now, subtract the second sum from the first: 16 - 0 = 16
Multiply by 1/2 the absolute value: |16| / 2 = 8
Therefore, the area of quadrilateral DBEF is 8.
Let me verify this calculation again.
Wait:
Listing the coordinates:
D: (0,3)
B: (0,0)
E: (4,0)
F: (8/3, 2)
Compute shoelace sum:
Forward direction (xi * yi+1):
0*0 + 0*0 + 4*2 + (8/3)*3
= 0 + 0 + 8 + 8 = 16
Backward direction (xi+1 * yi):
0*3 + 4*0 + (8/3)*0 + 0*2
= 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0
Thus, difference is 16 - 0 = 16.
Take absolute value (unnecessary since positive) and multiply by 1/2: 16/2 = 8.
Yes, that's correct.
Alternatively, maybe using another method, such as breaking the quadrilateral into simpler shapes.
For example, quadrilateral DBEF can be divided into two triangles: DBE and BEF, but is that correct?
Wait, quadrilateral DBEF has vertices D(0,3), B(0,0), E(4,0), F(8/3,2). If I connect B to E, that would divide DBEF into triangles DBE and BEF.
Calculate area of triangle DBE:
Points D(0,3), B(0,0), E(4,0)
Using the formula for the area of a triangle with coordinates:
(1/2)| (x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2) ) |
Plugging in D(0,3), B(0,0), E(4,0):
(1/2)| 0*(0 - 0) + 0*(0 - 3) + 4*(3 - 0) | = (1/2)| 0 + 0 + 12 | = (1/2)*12 = 6
So area of DBE is 6.
Now area of triangle BEF: points B(0,0), E(4,0), F(8/3,2)
Using same formula:
(1/2)| x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2) |
Plugging in B(0,0), E(4,0), F(8/3,2):
(1/2)| 0*(0 - 2) + 4*(2 - 0) + (8/3)*(0 - 0) | = (1/2)| 0 + 8 + 0 | = (1/2)*8 = 4
Thus, area of BEF is 4.
Total area of quadrilateral DBEF = area DBE + area BEF = 6 + 4 = 10
Wait, this gives 10, conflicting with the Shoelace result of 8.
So there must be a mistake here.
Wait, perhaps the division into triangles is not correct? Let me check.
Wait, if quadrilateral DBEF is divided into triangles DBE and BEF, but looking at the coordinates:
D(0,3), B(0,0), E(4,0), F(8/3,2). Connecting B to E, which is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (4,0). Then the triangle DBE is the one below D and above B? Wait, no. Wait, if you connect B to E, then DBE is a triangle with vertices D, B, E. But the quadrilateral is DBEF, so splitting it via BE would give triangles DBE and DEF? Wait, no. Wait, if you connect D to E, but in the quadrilateral DBEF, the order is D, B, E, F. So connecting B to E is a diagonal, splitting DBEF into triangles DBE and BEF.
But when we compute the area of DBE and BEF, do they indeed form non-overlapping regions covering the entire quadrilateral? Let me visualize.
But according to the problem, quadrilateral DBEF has vertices D, B, E, F. So connecting D to B to E to F. But how is F connected? From F back to D? Wait, no. The order is DBEF, so vertices in order are D, B, E, F. So the quadrilateral is formed by sides DB, BE, EF, FD. Wait, but in the problem statement, it's just the quadrilateral with vertices D, B, E, F. So the order is important. Therefore, the quadrilateral is D → B → E → F → D. But when I split it via the diagonal BE, then the area should be sum of triangles DBE and BEF. But we have 6 + 4 = 10, but Shoelace gave 8. So there's a discrepancy.
Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the quadrilateral is not convex? Looking at the coordinates:
D(0,3), B(0,0), E(4,0), F(8/3,2). If you plot these, starting from D(0,3), to B(0,0) (down to origin), to E(4,0) (across x-axis to (4,0)), to F(8/3 ≈2.666, 2), then back to D. The path from E(4,0) to F(8/3,2) is moving back towards F which is between (2.666,2). So the quadrilateral is "folded" there, possibly making BEF overlap or something. Wait, but when I connect E(4,0) to F(8/3,2), which is a line going up to F. Then from F(8/3,2) back to D(0,3). So the quadrilateral might be a trapezoid or some quadrilateral.
Alternatively, perhaps the error is in my assumption of the order of vertices.
Wait, in the problem statement, it says "quadrilateral DBEF". The order of the vertices is D, B, E, F. So in that order, the polygon is formed by sides DB, BE, EF, FD. But when applying the Shoelace formula, the order of the points is important. When I listed the coordinates in the Shoelace formula, I used D -> B -> E -> F -> D. However, if the actual order is different, that could lead to an error.
Wait, but according to the problem statement, the quadrilateral is DBEF, so the order is D, B, E, F. So when listing the coordinates for the Shoelace formula, that's the order I should use.
But according to the problem diagram, how is the quadrilateral oriented? Let me think. Point D is midpoint of AB (on left side), B is at the origin, E is midpoint of BC at (4,0) on the x-axis, F is somewhere in the middle. The quadrilateral is D to B to E to F and back to D. So yes, that's the correct order.
So why the discrepancy between the Shoelace result (8) and the triangle division result (10)? Let me check the coordinates again.
Wait, when we did the Shoelace calculation, we had:
Sum of xi*yi+1: 0*0 + 0*0 + 4*2 + (8/3)*3 = 0 + 0 +8 + 8 =16
Sum of xi+1*yi: 0*3 +4*0 + (8/3)*0 +0*2=0+0+0+0=0
Thus, difference is 16 -0=16, times 1/2 gives 8. So that's correct.
But when splitting into triangles DBE and BEF:
Area of DBE:
Points D(0,3); B(0,0); E(4,0)
Using the formula:
Area = 1/2 | (x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2) ) |
Plugging in D(0,3), B(0,0), E(4,0):
= 1/2 | 0*(0 - 0) + 0*(0 - 3) + 4*(3 - 0) | = 1/2 |0 +0 +12| =1/2*12=6. Correct.
Area of BEF:
Points B(0,0), E(4,0), F(8/3,2)
Area = 1/2 | 0*(0 - 2) +4*(2 -0) + (8/3)*(0 -0) | =1/2 |0 +8 +0|=1/2*8=4. Correct.
So total area is 6 +4=10.
But this contradicts the Shoelace result of 8.
Therefore, one of these must be wrong.
Wait, but how?
If two different methods give different results, there must be an error.
Given that, perhaps the way the quadrilateral is split into the two triangles is incorrect.
That is, maybe DBEF is not the union of DBE and BEF.
Wait, but when you connect B to E, in the quadrilateral DBEF, yes, that splits it into two triangles.
However, perhaps those triangles overlap?
No, because the quadrilateral is convex?
Wait, looking at the coordinates:
D(0,3), B(0,0), E(4,0), F(8/3,2).
Plot these points:
D is (0,3), straight up from B(0,0) which is the origin.
E is (4,0) on the x-axis.
F is at (8/3, 2) which is approximately (2.666,2).
So, if you connect D to B to E to F and back to D, the quadrilateral is a four-sided figure. The diagonal BE would split it into two triangles, DBE and BFE. However, maybe the point F is on the opposite side?
Wait, but F is at (8/3, 2), which is between D and E?
Wait, no. From E(4,0) to F(8/3,2): 8/3 ≈2.666... which is less than 4, so moving from E to F is from (4,0) to (2.666,2), which is moving left and up. From F to D is (2.666,2) to (0,3), moving left and up further. So the quadrilateral wraps around.
But perhaps the area is self-intersecting? If the quadrilateral is ordered D, B, E, F, then sides BE and FD might cross. Wait, let me check.
Plotting the points:
D(0,3), B(0,0), E(4,0), F(8/3,2).
The order of the quadrilateral is D → B → E → F → D.
So sides are:
- DB: from D(0,3) to B(0,0): vertical line at x=0 from y=3 to 0.
- BE: from B(0,0) to E(4,0): horizontal line at y=0 from x=0 to 4.
- EF: from E(4,0) to F(8/3,2): line from (4,0) to (8/3,2) ≈(2.666,2). So this line goes from (4,0) to (8/3,2). Let's compute the slope: (2 -0)/(8/3 -4) = 2 / (8/3 - 12/3) = 2 / (-4/3) = -3/2. So slope is -3/2.
- FD: from F(8/3,2) to D(0,3): line from (8/3,2) to (0,3). Slope is (3 -2)/(0 - 8/3) = 1 / (-8/3) = -3/8.
Now, looking at the sides:
- DB is vertical from (0,3) to (0,0).
- BE is horizontal from (0,0) to (4,0).
- EF goes from (4,0) to (8/3,2).
- FD goes from (8/3,2) back to (0,3).
Now, sides BE (from (0,0) to (4,0)) and FD (from (8/3,2) to (0,3)) could potentially intersect. Let's check if they do.
Line BE is the horizontal line segment from (0,0) to (4,0). Line FD is the line from (8/3,2) to (0,3).
Let's compute if these segments intersect.
Parametrize line BE: starts at (0,0) and goes to (4,0). Parametric equations: x = 0 + t*(4 -0) = 4t, y = 0 + t*(0 -0) = 0, for t in [0,1].
Parametrize line FD: starts at (8/3,2) and goes to (0,3). Parametric equations: x = 8/3 - s*(8/3 -0) = 8/3 - s*8/3, y = 2 + s*(3 -2) = 2 + s, for s in [0,1].
To find intersection, solve for t and s where:
4t = 8/3 - s*8/3
0 = 2 + s
From the second equation, s = -2. But s must be between 0 and 1, so no solution. Therefore, the segments do not intersect.
Similarly, checking other segments:
DB is vertical from (0,3) to (0,0). EF goes from (4,0) to (8/3,2). These segments are not overlapping.
FD goes from (8/3,2) to (0,3). BE is from (0,0) to (4,0). We checked, no intersection.
So the quadrilateral DBEF is a simple quadrilateral (not self-intersecting).
So why is there a discrepancy between the Shoelace formula (8) and the triangle division (10)?
Wait, perhaps in the triangle division, triangle DBE and BEF together actually cover more area than the quadrilateral, because when we split the quadrilateral into two triangles DBE and BEF, the triangle BEF extends beyond the quadrilateral.
Wait, perhaps. Let me see. The triangle BEF is the area from B to E to F. But in the quadrilateral, from B to E to F is part of the boundary, but the quadrilateral turns from F back to D, while the triangle BEF continues from F to B. Wait, no, the triangle BEF is B(0,0), E(4,0), F(8/3,2). That should coincide with the quadrilateral's lower part.
But why the difference? Hmm.
Alternatively, perhaps the error is in the Shoelace formula application. Let me double-check.
Coordinates listed in order: D(0,3), B(0,0), E(4,0), F(8/3,2), then back to D(0,3).
Applying the Shoelace formula:
Forward方向的积分为:
0*0 + 0*0 + 4*2 + (8/3)*3
= 0 + 0 + 8 + 8 = 16
Backward方向的积分为:
0*3 + 4*0 + (8/3)*0 + 0*2
= 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0
因此,面积为 |16 - 0| / 2 = 8.
正确.
Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in the triangle division. Let's see.
If the area of quadrilateral DBEF is indeed 8, then why when divided into DBE and BEF, with areas 6 and 4 respectively, do we get 10? That suggests that the triangles DBE and BEF together include some overlapping area or go outside the quadrilateral.
But how?
Let me visualize:
Quadrilateral DBEF:
- From D(0,3) to B(0,0) to E(4,0) to F(8/3,2) back to D.
If we split it into triangles DBE and BEF:
- Triangle DBE covers the area from D to B to E. This is the left lower triangle.
- Triangle BEF covers the area from B to E to F. However, in the quadrilateral, after E, it goes to F, but in the triangle BEF, it goes back to B. So maybe the direction matters. Wait, but area is positive.
Alternatively, perhaps the quadrilateral is not made up of DBE and BEF. Maybe it's DBF and BFE or something else. Wait, perhaps not.
Alternatively, perhaps the area of quadrilateral DBEF can be calculated by another method.
Let me try using coordinates and vectors.
The area of a quadrilateral can be calculated using the shoelace formula, which I already did. Alternatively, using coordinates, the area can be found by subtracting areas of other parts.
Alternatively, consider that quadrilateral DBEF can be seen as the trapezoid between lines DB, BE, EF, FD.
Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not in the calculations but in the interpretation of the problem.
Wait, the problem says "Determine the area of quadrilateral DBEF". But according to the problem figure, when I use the shoelace formula on points D,B,E,F, I get 8. However, splitting into triangles gives 10, which seems conflicting.
But if the problem quadrilateral is indeed the polygon DBEF as ordered, then shoelace is correct.
Let me check with coordinates.
Wait, maybe the error is in the triangle division. Let me confirm the coordinates again.
Coordinates:
D(0,3), B(0,0), E(4,0), F(8/3,2)
The quadrilateral is DBEF: D to B to E to F to D.
Let me plot this mentally:
Starting at D(0,3), go down to B(0,0), then right to E(4,0), then up to F(8/3,2), then back to D. The path from E to F is to (8/3,2) which is leftwards and upwards. Then from F to D is leftwards and upwards more.
Alternatively, maybe the quadrilateral is not convex, which may cause the Shoelace formula to subtract areas. But in the standard application, as long as the vertices are listed in order (clockwise or counterclockwise), the formula gives the correct area.
Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in listing the coordinates in the Shoelace formula. Let me check again.
Listing coordinates in order: D(0,3), B(0,0), E(4,0), F(8/3,2), back to D(0,3).
Now, applying the Shoelace formula:
Sum over i (xi * yi+1 - xi+1 * yi)
Compute each term:
From D to B:
x1=0, y1=3; x2=0, y2=0
Term: (0*0 - 0*3) = 0 - 0 = 0
From B to E:
x2=0, y2=0; x3=4, y3=0
Term: (0*0 - 4*0) = 0 - 0 = 0
From E to F:
x3=4, y3=0; x4=8/3, y4=2
Term: (4*2 - 8/3*0) = 8 - 0 = 8
From F to D:
x4=8/3, y4=2; x5=0, y5=3
Term: (8/3*3 - 0*2) = 8 - 0 = 8
Sum of all terms: 0 + 0 + 8 + 8 = 16
Take absolute value (already positive) and multiply by 1/2: |16| * 1/2 = 8
So the area is 8.
Alternatively, if we traverse the polygon in the other direction (e.g., D to F to E to B to D), the result would be -16, take absolute value and same area.
Therefore, the Shoelace formula consistently gives 8.
But splitting into triangles DBE and BEF gives areas 6 and 4, totaling 10. Therefore, the problem must be in how the quadrilateral is split into triangles. Wait, perhaps the triangle BEF is incorrectly calculated.
Wait, if the quadrilateral is DBEF, then splitting it into DBE and BEF adds the area of triangle BEF, which is outside the quadrilateral. Wait, no, because in the quadrilateral DBEF, after E, you go to F, so the part from B to E to F should be part of the quadrilateral. Alternatively, maybe the triangle BEF is actually a different shape.
Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the triangle BEF is actually a different triangle. Let me see.
In the quadrilateral DBEF, the edges are D to B, B to E, E to F, F to D.
The triangle BEF is B to E to F to B. However, in the quadrilateral, after E to F, you go to D, not back to B. So perhaps splitting the quadrilateral into triangle DBE and triangle BEF is incorrect because the edge from F to D is missing in the triangle BEF. Therefore, triangle BEF extends beyond the quadrilateral.
Therefore, the area calculated via triangles DBE (6) and BEF (4) is actually the area of the quadrilateral plus the area of triangle FDB.
Wait, but then the quadrilateral DBEF would be 6 + area(FE region) and triangle BEF is 4. Hmm.
Alternatively, maybe the error is that when we split the quadrilateral into DBE and BEF, triangle BEF includes the area from B to E to F to B, but the quadrilateral goes from B to E to F to D. Therefore, the triangle BEF includes an extra area beyond the quadrilateral, which would explain why adding DBE (6) and BEF (4) gives a larger area than the Shoelace result (8).
Therefore, the Shoelace formula must be correct here because it directly calculates the area based on the vertices, whereas the triangle method incorrectly counts an extra region.
Therefore, the correct area is 8.
Alternatively, maybe the problem is in the coordinates of F.
Wait, F is the intersection of EA and DC.
Let's recalculate F's coordinates.
Previously, we found F by intersecting EA and DC.
Line EA: from E(4,0) to A(0,6). Equation: y = (-3/2)x + 6.
Line DC: from D(0,3) to C(8,0). Equation: y = (-3/8)x + 3.
Solving:
Set equations equal:
(-3/2)x + 6 = (-3/8)x + 3
Multiply both sides by 8 to eliminate denominators:
8*(-3/2 x) + 8*6 = 8*(-3/8 x) +8*3
Simplify:
-12x + 48 = -3x +24
Bring all terms to left:
-12x +48 +3x -24 =0
-9x +24=0
-9x = -24 => x= 24/9=8/3.
Then y= (-3/2)(8/3) +6= -4 +6=2.
So F is (8/3, 2). Correct.
Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the figure is drawn in a way that is confusing. For example, if in the diagram, F is not actually where lines EA and DC intersect, but the problem states that. Wait, but according to the problem statement, the user didn't mention F's construction, just gave the diagram. However, in the Asymptote code, F is explicitly set at (8/3,2). So we can take F's coordinates as given.
Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trapezoid with area 8.
Therefore, the answer is 8.
Given that two independent methods (Shoelace and trapezoid decomposition) gave 8 and 10, but the third method (triangle decomposition) gave 10, but the problem with triangle decomposition is that the triangle BEF includes areas outside the quadrilateral DBEF. Therefore, the correct answer must be 8.
Therefore, the final answer is 8.
</Think>

Answer: To solve the problem of finding the area of quadrilateral DBEF, we start by determining the coordinates of all relevant points:

- Coordinates of D (midpoint of AB): \( (0, 3) \)
- Coordinates of B: \( (0, 0) \)
- Coordinates of E (midpoint of BC): \( (4, 0) \)
- Coordinates of F (intersection of EA and DC): \( \left( \frac{8}{3}, 2 \right) \)

We then use the Shoelace formula to calculate the area of quadrilateral DBEF with vertices \( D(0, 3) \), \( B(0, 0) \), \( E(4, 0) \), and \( F\left( \frac{8}{3}, 2 \right) \).

The Shoelace formula states:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i) \right|
\]
where \( (x_{n+1}, y_{n+1}) = (x_1, y_1) \).

Applying this to our vertices:

1. **From D(0, 3) to B(0, 0)**:
   \[
   0 \cdot 0 - 0 \cdot 3 = 0
   \]

2. **From B(0, 0) to E(4, 0)**:
   \[
   0 \cdot 0 - 4 \cdot 0 = 0
   \]

3. **From E(4, 0) to F\(\left( \frac{8}{3}, 2 \right)\))**:
   \[
   4 \cdot 2 - \frac{8}{3} \cdot 0 = 8
   \]

4. **From F\(\left( \frac{8}{3}, 2 \right)\) to D(0, 3)**:
   \[
   \frac{8}{3} \cdot 3 - 0 \cdot 2 = 8
   \]

Summing these results:
\[
0 + 0 + 8 + 8 = 16
\]

Taking the absolute value and multiplying by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 16 = 8
\]

Thus, the area of quadrilateral DBEF is \(\boxed{8}\).

okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. the question is about finding the area of quadrilateral dbef. looking at the diagram, there are points a, b, c, d, e, and f. coordinates are given for points a, b, and c. let me note those down first:
- a is at (0, 6)
- b is at (0, 0)
- c is at (8, 0)
d is the midpoint of ab, and e is the midpoint of bc. so, let's find coordinates for d and e.
calculating d: since it's the midpoint of ab. the coordinates of a are (0,6) and b are (0,0). the midpoint formula is ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2). so, d would be ((0 + 0)/2, (6 + 0)/2) = (0, 3).
similarly, e is the midpoint of bc. coordinates of b are (0,0) and c are (8,0). applying the midpoint formula: ((0 + 8)/2, (0 + 0)/2) = (4, 0). so e is at (4, 0).
the quadrilateral in question is dbef. so the vertices are d, b, e, and f. wait, but f is another point. the diagram labels an f, which isn't a midpoint. hmm, the problem didn't describe f, so maybe it's part of the figure. looking back at the problem statement, they mention determining the area of quadrilateral dbef. so points d, b, e, f form this quadrilateral. but we need coordinates for all these points to compute the area.
wait, f is labeled in the diagram. let me check if coordinates for f are given. the label says "f(8/3, 2)". let me verify that. wait, in the code, it says: label("$f$", f, sw); so the problem might not explicitly give the coordinates of f, but in the asymptote code, the coordinates are specified. let me check the asymptote code for point f: f=(8/3,2); so in the diagram, f is at (8/3, 2). but wait, perhaps f is another midpoint or an intersection point? let me see. the problem says d and e are midpoints, but f might be an intersection of some lines. in the diagram, it looks like f is the intersection of lines ea and dc. let me confirm that. the diagram shows lines ea and dc intersecting at f. so, if we need to compute the coordinates of f, we can find the intersection of lines ea and dc.
given points:
e is at (4,0) (midpoint of bc)
a is at (0,6)
so line ea connects (4,0) and (0,6)
similarly, d is at (0,3) (midpoint of ab)
c is at (8,0)
so line dc connects (0,3) and (8,0)
let me verify that. wait, in the problem statement, it says "draw(ea) and draw(dc)". so lines ea and dc intersect at point f. therefore, let's compute the coordinates of f by finding the intersection of lines ea and dc.
first, find equations for lines ea and dc.
let's start with line ea: passing through e(4,0) and a(0,6).
the slope (m) is (6 - 0)/(0 - 4) = 6/-4 = -3/2.
so the equation using point-slope form from point e(4,0):
y - 0 = (-3/2)(x - 4)
y = (-3/2)x + 6
equation 1: y = (-3/2)x + 6
now, line dc: connecting d(0,3) and c(8,0).
calculate the slope: m = (0 - 3)/(8 - 0) = (-3)/8 = -3/8
using point d(0,3):
y - 3 = (-3/8)(x - 0)
y = (-3/8)x + 3
equation 2: y = (-3/8)x + 3
now, find the intersection point f by setting equations equal:
(-3/2)x + 6 = (-3/8)x + 3
multiply both sides by 8 to eliminate denominators:
8*(-3/2 x) + 8*6 = 8*(-3/8 x) + 8*3
simplify:
-12x + 48 = -3x + 24
bring all terms to left side:
-12x + 48 + 3x - 24 = 0
-9x + 24 = 0
-9x = -24
x = -24 / (-9) = 24/9 = 8/3 ≈ 2.666...
so x = 8/3.
now, substitute x = 8/3 into one of the equations, say equation 1:
y = (-3/2)(8/3) + 6
calculate:
first term: (-3/2)*(8/3) = (-24/6) = -4
so y = -4 + 6 = 2
therefore, f is at (8/3, 2), which matches the asymptote code. so the coordinates of f are (8/3, 2).
now that we have all coordinates:
d: (0,3)
b: (0,0)
e: (4,0)
f: (8/3, 2)
we need to find the area of quadrilateral dbef, with vertices d, b, e, f.
one way to compute the area is by using the shoelace formula (gauss's area formula), which allows calculating the area of a polygon when the coordinates of its vertices are known.
shoelace formula: for polygon with vertices (x1,y1), (x2,y2), ..., (xn,yn), (x1,y1),
area = |(1/2)[(sum from i=1 to n of (xi yi+1 - xi+1 yi)))]|
let's list the coordinates of the quadrilateral dbef in order:
d: (0,3)
b: (0,0)
e: (4,0)
f: (8/3, 2)
then back to d: (0,3)
apply the shoelace formula:
first, list the coordinates in order:
1. (0,3)
2. (0,0)
3. (4,0)
4. (8/3, 2)
5. (0,3)
now, compute the sum of xi yi+1 and subtract the sum of xi+1 yi, then take half the absolute value.
compute the products:
first, calculate the products xi * yi+1:
1. 0 * 0 = 0 (d to b: (0,3) to (0,0): x1*y2=0*0=0)
2. 0 * 0 = 0 (b to e: (0,0) to (4,0): x2*y3=0*0=0)
3. 4 * 2 = 8 (e to f: (4,0) to (8/3,2): x3*y4=4*2=8)
4. (8/3) * 3 = 8 (f to d: (8/3,2) to (0,3): x4*y5=8/3*3=8)
sum of xi*yi+1 = 0 + 0 + 8 + 8 = 16
now, calculate the products xi+1 * yi:
1. 0 * 3 = 0 (b's x * d's y: 0*3=0)
2. 4 * 0 = 0 (e's x * b's y: 4*0=0)
3. (8/3) * 0 = 0 (f's x * e's y: 8/3*0=0)
4. 0 * 2 = 0 (d's x * f's y: 0*2=0)
sum of xi+1*yi = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0
now, subtract the second sum from the first: 16 - 0 = 16
multiply by 1/2 the absolute value: |16| / 2 = 8
therefore, the area of quadrilateral dbef is 8.
let me verify this calculation again.
wait:
listing the coordinates:
d: (0,3)
b: (0,0)
e: (4,0)
f: (8/3, 2)
compute shoelace sum:
forward direction (xi * yi+1):
0*0 + 0*0 + 4*2 + (8/3)*3
= 0 + 0 + 8 + 8 = 16
backward direction (xi+1 * yi):
0*3 + 4*0 + (8/3)*0 + 0*2
= 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0
thus, difference is 16 - 0 = 16.
take absolute value (unnecessary since positive) and multiply by 1/2: 16/2 = 8.
yes, that's correct.
alternatively, maybe using another method, such as breaking the quadrilateral into simpler shapes.
for example, quadrilateral dbef can be divided into two triangles: dbe and bef, but is that correct?
wait, quadrilateral dbef has vertices d(0,3), b(0,0), e(4,0), f(8/3,2). if i connect b to e, that would divide dbef into triangles dbe and bef.
calculate area of triangle dbe:
points d(0,3), b(0,0), e(4,0)
using the formula for the area of a triangle with coordinates:
(1/2)| (x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2) ) |
plugging in d(0,3), b(0,0), e(4,0):
(1/2)| 0*(0 - 0) + 0*(0 - 3) + 4*(3 - 0) | = (1/2)| 0 + 0 + 12 | = (1/2)*12 = 6
so area of dbe is 6.
now area of triangle bef: points b(0,0), e(4,0), f(8/3,2)
using same formula:
(1/2)| x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2) |
plugging in b(0,0), e(4,0), f(8/3,2):
(1/2)| 0*(0 - 2) + 4*(2 - 0) + (8/3)*(0 - 0) | = (1/2)| 0 + 8 + 0 | = (1/2)*8 = 4
thus, area of bef is 4.
total area of quadrilateral dbef = area dbe + area bef = 6 + 4 = 10
wait, this gives 10, conflicting with the shoelace result of 8.
so there must be a mistake here.
wait, perhaps the division into triangles is not correct? let me check.
wait, if quadrilateral dbef is divided into triangles dbe and bef, but looking at the coordinates:
d(0,3), b(0,0), e(4,0), f(8/3,2). connecting b to e, which is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (4,0). then the triangle dbe is the one below d and above b? wait, no. wait, if you connect b to e, then dbe is a triangle with vertices d, b, e. but the quadrilateral is dbef, so splitting it via be would give triangles dbe and def? wait, no. wait, if you connect d to e, but in the quadrilateral dbef, the order is d, b, e, f. so connecting b to e is a diagonal, splitting dbef into triangles dbe and bef.
but when we compute the area of dbe and bef, do they indeed form non-overlapping regions covering the entire quadrilateral? let me visualize.
but according to the problem, quadrilateral dbef has vertices d, b, e, f. so connecting d to b to e to f. but how is f connected? from f back to d? wait, no. the order is dbef, so vertices in order are d, b, e, f. so the quadrilateral is formed by sides db, be, ef, fd. wait, but in the problem statement, it's just the quadrilateral with vertices d, b, e, f. so the order is important. therefore, the quadrilateral is d → b → e → f → d. but when i split it via the diagonal be, then the area should be sum of triangles dbe and bef. but we have 6 + 4 = 10, but shoelace gave 8. so there's a discrepancy.
alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the quadrilateral is not convex? looking at the coordinates:
d(0,3), b(0,0), e(4,0), f(8/3,2). if you plot these, starting from d(0,3), to b(0,0) (down to origin), to e(4,0) (across x-axis to (4,0)), to f(8/3 ≈2.666, 2), then back to d. the path from e(4,0) to f(8/3,2) is moving back towards f which is between (2.666,2). so the quadrilateral is "folded" there, possibly making bef overlap or something. wait, but when i connect e(4,0) to f(8/3,2), which is a line going up to f. then from f(8/3,2) back to d(0,3). so the quadrilateral might be a trapezoid or some quadrilateral.
alternatively, perhaps the error is in my assumption of the order of vertices.
wait, in the problem statement, it says "quadrilateral dbef". the order of the vertices is d, b, e, f. so in that order, the polygon is formed by sides db, be, ef, fd. but when applying the shoelace formula, the order of the points is important. when i listed the coordinates in the shoelace formula, i used d -> b -> e -> f -> d. however, if the actual order is different, that could lead to an error.
wait, but according to the problem statement, the quadrilateral is dbef, so the order is d, b, e, f. so when listing the coordinates for the shoelace formula, that's the order i should use.
but according to the problem diagram, how is the quadrilateral oriented? let me think. point d is midpoint of ab (on left side), b is at the origin, e is midpoint of bc at (4,0) on the x-axis, f is somewhere in the middle. the quadrilateral is d to b to e to f and back to d. so yes, that's the correct order.
so why the discrepancy between the shoelace result (8) and the triangle division result (10)? let me check the coordinates again.
wait, when we did the shoelace calculation, we had:
sum of xi*yi+1: 0*0 + 0*0 + 4*2 + (8/3)*3 = 0 + 0 +8 + 8 =16
sum of xi+1*yi: 0*3 +4*0 + (8/3)*0 +0*2=0+0+0+0=0
thus, difference is 16 -0=16, times 1/2 gives 8. so that's correct.
but when splitting into triangles dbe and bef:
area of dbe:
points d(0,3); b(0,0); e(4,0)
using the formula:
area = 1/2 | (x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2) ) |
plugging in d(0,3), b(0,0), e(4,0):
= 1/2 | 0*(0 - 0) + 0*(0 - 3) + 4*(3 - 0) | = 1/2 |0 +0 +12| =1/2*12=6. correct.
area of bef:
points b(0,0), e(4,0), f(8/3,2)
area = 1/2 | 0*(0 - 2) +4*(2 -0) + (8/3)*(0 -0) | =1/2 |0 +8 +0|=1/2*8=4. correct.
so total area is 6 +4=10.
but this contradicts the shoelace result of 8.
therefore, one of these must be wrong.
wait, but how?
if two different methods give different results, there must be an error.
given that, perhaps the way the quadrilateral is split into the two triangles is incorrect.
that is, maybe dbef is not the union of dbe and bef.
wait, but when you connect b to e, in the quadrilateral dbef, yes, that splits it into two triangles.
however, perhaps those triangles overlap?
no, because the quadrilateral is convex?
wait, looking at the coordinates:
d(0,3), b(0,0), e(4,0), f(8/3,2).
plot these points:
d is (0,3), straight up from b(0,0) which is the origin.
e is (4,0) on the x-axis.
f is at (8/3, 2) which is approximately (2.666,2).
so, if you connect d to b to e to f and back to d, the quadrilateral is a four-sided figure. the diagonal be would split it into two triangles, dbe and bfe. however, maybe the point f is on the opposite side?
wait, but f is at (8/3, 2), which is between d and e?
wait, no. from e(4,0) to f(8/3,2): 8/3 ≈2.666... which is less than 4, so moving from e to f is from (4,0) to (2.666,2), which is moving left and up. from f to d is (2.666,2) to (0,3), moving left and up further. so the quadrilateral wraps around.
but perhaps the area is self-intersecting? if the quadrilateral is ordered d, b, e, f, then sides be and fd might cross. wait, let me check.
plotting the points:
d(0,3), b(0,0), e(4,0), f(8/3,2).
the order of the quadrilateral is d → b → e → f → d.
so sides are:
- db: from d(0,3) to b(0,0): vertical line at x=0 from y=3 to 0.
- be: from b(0,0) to e(4,0): horizontal line at y=0 from x=0 to 4.
- ef: from e(4,0) to f(8/3,2): line from (4,0) to (8/3,2) ≈(2.666,2). so this line goes from (4,0) to (8/3,2). let's compute the slope: (2 -0)/(8/3 -4) = 2 / (8/3 - 12/3) = 2 / (-4/3) = -3/2. so slope is -3/2.
- fd: from f(8/3,2) to d(0,3): line from (8/3,2) to (0,3). slope is (3 -2)/(0 - 8/3) = 1 / (-8/3) = -3/8.
now, looking at the sides:
- db is vertical from (0,3) to (0,0).
- be is horizontal from (0,0) to (4,0).
- ef goes from (4,0) to (8/3,2).
- fd goes from (8/3,2) back to (0,3).
now, sides be (from (0,0) to (4,0)) and fd (from (8/3,2) to (0,3)) could potentially intersect. let's check if they do.
line be is the horizontal line segment from (0,0) to (4,0). line fd is the line from (8/3,2) to (0,3).
let's compute if these segments intersect.
parametrize line be: starts at (0,0) and goes to (4,0). parametric equations: x = 0 + t*(4 -0) = 4t, y = 0 + t*(0 -0) = 0, for t in [0,1].
parametrize line fd: starts at (8/3,2) and goes to (0,3). parametric equations: x = 8/3 - s*(8/3 -0) = 8/3 - s*8/3, y = 2 + s*(3 -2) = 2 + s, for s in [0,1].
to find intersection, solve for t and s where:
4t = 8/3 - s*8/3
0 = 2 + s
from the second equation, s = -2. but s must be between 0 and 1, so no solution. therefore, the segments do not intersect.
similarly, checking other segments:
db is vertical from (0,3) to (0,0). ef goes from (4,0) to (8/3,2). these segments are not overlapping.
fd goes from (8/3,2) to (0,3). be is from (0,0) to (4,0). we checked, no intersection.
so the quadrilateral dbef is a simple quadrilateral (not self-intersecting).
so why is there a discrepancy between the shoelace formula (8) and the triangle division (10)?
wait, perhaps in the triangle division, triangle dbe and bef together actually cover more area than the quadrilateral, because when we split the quadrilateral into two triangles dbe and bef, the triangle bef extends beyond the quadrilateral.
wait, perhaps. let me see. the triangle bef is the area from b to e to f. but in the quadrilateral, from b to e to f is part of the boundary, but the quadrilateral turns from f back to d, while the triangle bef continues from f to b. wait, no, the triangle bef is b(0,0), e(4,0), f(8/3,2). that should coincide with the quadrilateral's lower part.
but why the difference? hmm.
alternatively, perhaps the error is in the shoelace formula application. let me double-check.
coordinates listed in order: d(0,3), b(0,0), e(4,0), f(8/3,2), then back to d(0,3).
applying the shoelace formula:
forward方向的积分为:
0*0 + 0*0 + 4*2 + (8/3)*3
= 0 + 0 + 8 + 8 = 16
backward方向的积分为:
0*3 + 4*0 + (8/3)*0 + 0*2
= 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0
因此,面积为 |16 - 0| / 2 = 8.
正确.
alternatively, perhaps the problem is in the triangle division. let's see.
if the area of quadrilateral dbef is indeed 8, then why when divided into dbe and bef, with areas 6 and 4 respectively, do we get 10? that suggests that the triangles dbe and bef together include some overlapping area or go outside the quadrilateral.
but how?
let me visualize:
quadrilateral dbef:
- from d(0,3) to b(0,0) to e(4,0) to f(8/3,2) back to d.
if we split it into triangles dbe and bef:
- triangle dbe covers the area from d to b to e. this is the left lower triangle.
- triangle bef covers the area from b to e to f. however, in the quadrilateral, after e, it goes to f, but in the triangle bef, it goes back to b. so maybe the direction matters. wait, but area is positive.
alternatively, perhaps the quadrilateral is not made up of dbe and bef. maybe it's dbf and bfe or something else. wait, perhaps not.
alternatively, perhaps the area of quadrilateral dbef can be calculated by another method.
let me try using coordinates and vectors.
the area of a quadrilateral can be calculated using the shoelace formula, which i already did. alternatively, using coordinates, the area can be found by subtracting areas of other parts.
alternatively, consider that quadrilateral dbef can be seen as the trapezoid between lines db, be, ef, fd.
alternatively, perhaps the problem is not in the calculations but in the interpretation of the problem.
wait, the problem says "determine the area of quadrilateral dbef". but according to the problem figure, when i use the shoelace formula on points d,b,e,f, i get 8. however, splitting into triangles gives 10, which seems conflicting.
but if the problem quadrilateral is indeed the polygon dbef as ordered, then shoelace is correct.
let me check with coordinates.
wait, maybe the error is in the triangle division. let me confirm the coordinates again.
coordinates:
d(0,3), b(0,0), e(4,0), f(8/3,2)
the quadrilateral is dbef: d to b to e to f to d.
let me plot this mentally:
starting at d(0,3), go down to b(0,0), then right to e(4,0), then up to f(8/3,2), then back to d. the path from e to f is to (8/3,2) which is leftwards and upwards. then from f to d is leftwards and upwards more.
alternatively, maybe the quadrilateral is not convex, which may cause the shoelace formula to subtract areas. but in the standard application, as long as the vertices are listed in order (clockwise or counterclockwise), the formula gives the correct area.
wait, perhaps i made a mistake in listing the coordinates in the shoelace formula. let me check again.
listing coordinates in order: d(0,3), b(0,0), e(4,0), f(8/3,2), back to d(0,3).
now, applying the shoelace formula:
sum over i (xi * yi+1 - xi+1 * yi)
compute each term:
from d to b:
x1=0, y1=3; x2=0, y2=0
term: (0*0 - 0*3) = 0 - 0 = 0
from b to e:
x2=0, y2=0; x3=4, y3=0
term: (0*0 - 4*0) = 0 - 0 = 0
from e to f:
x3=4, y3=0; x4=8/3, y4=2
term: (4*2 - 8/3*0) = 8 - 0 = 8
from f to d:
x4=8/3, y4=2; x5=0, y5=3
term: (8/3*3 - 0*2) = 8 - 0 = 8
sum of all terms: 0 + 0 + 8 + 8 = 16
take absolute value (already positive) and multiply by 1/2: |16| * 1/2 = 8
so the area is 8.
alternatively, if we traverse the polygon in the other direction (e.g., d to f to e to b to d), the result would be -16, take absolute value and same area.
therefore, the shoelace formula consistently gives 8.
but splitting into triangles dbe and bef gives areas 6 and 4, totaling 10. therefore, the problem must be in how the quadrilateral is split into triangles. wait, perhaps the triangle bef is incorrectly calculated.
wait, if the quadrilateral is dbef, then splitting it into dbe and bef adds the area of triangle bef, which is outside the quadrilateral. wait, no, because in the quadrilateral dbef, after e, you go to f, so the part from b to e to f should be part of the quadrilateral. alternatively, maybe the triangle bef is actually a different shape.
wait, perhaps the mistake is that the triangle bef is actually a different triangle. let me see.
in the quadrilateral dbef, the edges are d to b, b to e, e to f, f to d.
the triangle bef is b to e to f to b. however, in the quadrilateral, after e to f, you go to d, not back to b. so perhaps splitting the quadrilateral into triangle dbe and triangle bef is incorrect because the edge from f to d is missing in the triangle bef. therefore, triangle bef extends beyond the quadrilateral.
therefore, the area calculated via triangles dbe (6) and bef (4) is actually the area of the quadrilateral plus the area of triangle fdb.
wait, but then the quadrilateral dbef would be 6 + area(fe region) and triangle bef is 4. hmm.
alternatively, maybe the error is that when we split the quadrilateral into dbe and bef, triangle bef includes the area from b to e to f to b, but the quadrilateral goes from b to e to f to d. therefore, the triangle bef includes an extra area beyond the quadrilateral, which would explain why adding dbe (6) and bef (4) gives a larger area than the shoelace result (8).
therefore, the shoelace formula must be correct here because it directly calculates the area based on the vertices, whereas the triangle method incorrectly counts an extra region.
therefore, the correct area is 8.
alternatively, maybe the problem is in the coordinates of f.
wait, f is the intersection of ea and dc.
let's recalculate f's coordinates.
previously, we found f by intersecting ea and dc.
line ea: from e(4,0) to a(0,6). equation: y = (-3/2)x + 6.
line dc: from d(0,3) to c(8,0). equation: y = (-3/8)x + 3.
solving:
set equations equal:
(-3/2)x + 6 = (-3/8)x + 3
multiply both sides by 8 to eliminate denominators:
8*(-3/2 x) + 8*6 = 8*(-3/8 x) +8*3
simplify:
-12x + 48 = -3x +24
bring all terms to left:
-12x +48 +3x -24 =0
-9x +24=0
-9x = -24 => x= 24/9=8/3.
then y= (-3/2)(8/3) +6= -4 +6=2.
so f is (8/3, 2). correct.
alternatively, maybe the problem is that the figure is drawn in a way that is confusing. for example, if in the diagram, f is not actually where lines ea and dc intersect, but the problem states that. wait, but according to the problem statement, the user didn't mention f's construction, just gave the diagram. however, in the asymptote code, f is explicitly set at (8/3,2). so we can take f's coordinates as given.
alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trapezoid with area 8.
therefore, the answer is 8.
given that two independent methods (shoelace and trapezoid decomposition) gave 8 and 10, but the third method (triangle decomposition) gave 10, but the problem with triangle decomposition is that the triangle bef includes areas outside the quadrilateral dbef. therefore, the correct answer must be 8.
therefore, the final answer is 8.

answer: to solve the problem of finding the area of quadrilateral dbef, we start by determining the coordinates of all relevant points:

- coordinates of d (midpoint of ab): \( (0, 3) \)
- coordinates of b: \( (0, 0) \)
- coordinates of e (midpoint of bc): \( (4, 0) \)
- coordinates of f (intersection of ea and dc): \( \left( \frac{8}{3}, 2 \right) \)

we then use the shoelace formula to calculate the area of quadrilateral dbef with vertices \( d(0, 3) \), \( b(0, 0) \), \( e(4, 0) \), and \( f\left( \frac{8}{3}, 2 \right) \).

the shoelace formula states:
\[
\text{area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i) \right|
\]
where \( (x_{n+1}, y_{n+1}) = (x_1, y_1) \).

applying this to our vertices:

1. **from d(0, 3) to b(0, 0)**:
   \[
   0 \cdot 0 - 0 \cdot 3 = 0
   \]

2. **from b(0, 0) to e(4, 0)**:
   \[
   0 \cdot 0 - 4 \cdot 0 = 0
   \]

3. **from e(4, 0) to f\(\left( \frac{8}{3}, 2 \right)\))**:
   \[
   4 \cdot 2 - \frac{8}{3} \cdot 0 = 8
   \]

4. **from f\(\left( \frac{8}{3}, 2 \right)\) to d(0, 3)**:
   \[
   \frac{8}{3} \cdot 3 - 0 \cdot 2 = 8
   \]

summing these results:
\[
0 + 0 + 8 + 8 = 16
\]

taking the absolute value and multiplying by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
\[
\text{area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 16 = 8
\]

thus, the area of quadrilateral dbef is \(\boxed{8}\)
