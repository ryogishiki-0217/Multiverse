Okay, so I have this problem here about hyperbolas. Let me read it again. The foci are F1 at (10, 2) and F2 at (-16, 2). The set of points P such that the absolute difference in distances from P to F1 and F2 is 24 forms a hyperbola. I need to find the equation of this hyperbola in the standard form \(\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1\) and then calculate h + k + a + b.
First, I remember that for a hyperbola, the absolute difference of the distances from any point on the hyperbola to the two foci is constant and equals to 2a. So here, |PF1 - PF2| = 24, which means 2a = 24, so a = 12.
Alright, so that's the first piece of information. Next, the foci of a hyperbola are located at a distance of c from the center, where c is part of the relationship c2 = a2 + b2 for hyperbolas. So if I can find c, then I can later find b using this formula.
But first, I need to find the center of the hyperbola. The center is the midpoint between the two foci, right? So let me calculate the midpoint between F1 (10,2) and F2 (-16,2).
The x-coordinate of the center is the average of 10 and -16. So (10 + (-16))/2 = (-6)/2 = -3. The y-coordinate is the average of 2 and 2, which is 2. So the center (h, k) is (-3, 2). Therefore, h = -3 and k = 2.
Okay, that seems straightforward. Now, the distance between the center and each focus is c. Let's check that. The distance from the center (-3, 2) to F1 (10, 2) should be c. Since both points are on the line y=2, the distance is just the absolute difference in x-coordinates: |10 - (-3)| = 13. So c = 13.
Similarly, from the center to F2 (-16, 2) is |-16 - (-3)| = | -13 | = 13. Yep, same thing. So c = 13.
Now, since we have a hyperbola, the relationship between a, b, and c is c2 = a2 + b2. We already know that a = 12 (since 2a = 24) and c = 13. So let's solve for b.
So, c2 = a2 + b2 ⇒ 132 = 122 + b2 ⇒ 169 = 144 + b2 ⇒ b2 = 169 - 144 = 25 ⇒ so b is 5. Because b is positive, right? So b = 5.
Okay, so now we have a = 12, b = 5, h = -3, k = 2.
Wait, but hold on. Let me confirm the orientation of the hyperbola. Because hyperbolas can open horizontally or vertically. The standard form given here is \(\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1\), which is a horizontal transverse axis hyperbola. Since the foci are located at (h ± c, k) for horizontal transverse axis. Let's see, original foci are at (10,2) and (-16,2). So since the center is at (-3,2), then the foci are at (-3 ± 13, 2). Let's check: -3 + 13 = 10, and -3 - 13 = -16. Yep, that matches. So that does confirm it's a horizontal transverse axis hyperbola, so the standard form given is correct.
Therefore, the equation is \(\frac{(x + 3)^2}{12^2} - \frac{(y - 2)^2}{5^2} = 1\).
So, h = -3, k = 2, a = 12, b = 5.
Therefore, h + k + a + b = -3 + 2 + 12 + 5.
Let me calculate that: -3 + 2 is -1, -1 + 12 is 11, 11 + 5 is 16.
Wait, but hold on. Let me check that again. The problem says "the set of points P such that |PF1 - PF2| = 24". So because it's the absolute difference, that's equal to 2a. So 2a = 24, so a = 12. Then, for hyperbolas, c is the distance from the center to each focus, so c = 13 as we found. Then c2 should equal a2 + b2. So 132 = 122 + 52. 169 = 144 + 25, which is 169 = 169. That checks out. So that all seems correct.
Therefore, the values are correct. So h + k + a + b is -3 + 2 + 12 + 5 = 16.
Wait, but just to make sure, let's go through once more.
Center is at (-3, 2), so h = -3, k = 2. a is 12, as 2a = 24. Then c is 13. Then b2 = c2 - a2 = 169 - 144 = 25, so b = 5. Therefore, h + k + a + b = -3 + 2 + 12 + 5.
Let's compute step by step:
-3 + 2 = -1
-1 + 12 = 11
11 + 5 = 16.
Yes, so 16.
Hmm. But I have a thought. In hyperbola equations, when it's horizontal, the distances relate to 'a' being the distance from center to vertex. But let's check if the given condition is |PF1 - PF2| = 24. So in this case, 2a = 24, so a = 12. So the vertices would be at (h ± a, k) = (-3 ± 12, 2). So that's (9, 2) and (-15, 2). Wait, but if the foci are at (10, 2) and (-16, 2), which are at -3 ± 13, then the vertices at -3 ± 12. So (9,2) and (-15,2). Are those consistent? Let's see. The distance between the foci is 2c = 26, and the distance between vertices is 2a = 24. So the foci are further apart than the vertices, which makes sense because in hyperbolas, c > a. Wait, but actually, wait: for hyperbolas, c > a, since c2 = a2 + b2. Here, a = 12, c = 13, so yes, c > a. So that's correct.
So the vertices lie between the center and the foci on the major axis. That's expected.
So, all of that checks out. So, the equation is correct, and the values are h = -3, k = 2, a = 12, b = 5. So the sum is 16.
I think that's right. Let me check one more time.
h is -3, k is 2. So, plug into the equation: (x - (-3))2 / 122 - (y - 2)2 / 52 = 1. Yes. So, if someone were to graph this, it would be a hyperbola centered at (-3,2), opening left and right, since it's the horizontal transverse axis type. The distance from the center to each vertex is 12, and to each co-vertex (along the conjugate axis) is 5. But the actual asymptotes would be lines based on the slopes ± (b/a) or ± (a/b)? Wait, no. Wait, for hyperbola \(\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1\), the asymptotes are given by y - k = ± (b/a)(x - h). So in this case, they would be y - 2 = ± (5/12)(x + 3). But do I need to confirm that? Probably not, but just making sure the parameters are being used correctly.
So, given all that, the answer is 16. So, I can conclude.
**Final Answer** 
\boxed{16}
</Think>

Answer: Given the foci \( F_1 = (10, 2) \) and \( F_2 = (-16, 2) \), we need to find the equation of the hyperbola formed by the set of points \( P \) such that \( |PF_1 - PF_2| = 24 \).

1. **Identify the center of the hyperbola**:
   - The center is the midpoint of the foci. Calculating the midpoint:
     \[
     h = \frac{10 + (-16)}{2} = \frac{-6}{2} = -3, \quad k = \frac{2 + 2}{2} = 2
     \]
   - Thus, the center is \( (-3, 2) \).

2. **Determine \( a \)**:
   - The constant difference \( |PF_1 - PF_2| = 24 \) implies \( 2a = 24 \), so \( a = 12 \).

3. **Calculate the distance \( c \)**:
   - The distance from the center to each focus is \( c \). Calculating \( c \):
     \[
     c = |10 - (-3)| = 13
     \]

4. **Find \( b \)**:
   - Using the relationship \( c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \):
     \[
     13^2 = 12^2 + b^2 \implies 169 = 144 + b^2 \implies b^2 = 25 \implies b = 5
     \]

5. **Sum the values**:
   - The equation of the hyperbola is \( \frac{(x + 3)^2}{12^2} - \frac{(y - 2)^2}{5^2} = 1 \).
   - Therefore, \( h = -3 \), \( k = 2 \), \( a = 12 \), and \( b = 5 \).
   - Summing these values:
     \[
     h + k + a + b = -3 + 2 + 12 + 5 = 16
     \]

The final answer is \(\boxed{16}\).

answer: given the foci \( f_1 = (10, 2) \) and \( f_2 = (-16, 2) \), we need to find the equation of the hyperbola formed by the set of points \( p \) such that \( |pf_1 - pf_2| = 24 \).

1. **identify the center of the hyperbola**:
   - the center is the midpoint of the foci. calculating the midpoint:
     \[
     h = \frac{10 + (-16)}{2} = \frac{-6}{2} = -3, \quad k = \frac{2 + 2}{2} = 2

2. **determine \( a \)**:
   - the constant difference \( |pf_1 - pf_2| = 24 \) implies \( 2a = 24 \), so \( a = 12 \).

3. **calculate the distance \( c \)**:
   - the distance from the center to each focus is \( c \). calculating \( c \):
     \[
     c = |10 - (-3)| = 13
     \]

4. **find \( b \)**:
   - using the relationship \( c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \):
     \[
     13^2 = 12^2 + b^2 \implies 169 = 144 + b^2 \implies b^2 = 25 \implies b = 5
     \]

5. **sum the values**:
   - the equation of the hyperbola is \( \frac{(x + 3)^2}{12^2} - \frac{(y - 2)^2}{5^2} = 1 \).
   - therefore, \( h = -3 \), \( k = 2 \), \( a = 12 \), and \( b = 5 \).
   - summing these values:
     \[
     h + k + a + b = -3 + 2 + 12 + 5 = 16
     \]
