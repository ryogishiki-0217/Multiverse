问题: Six cars pull up to a red light, one at a time. At the light, there are three lanes, one left-turn lane, one straight-going lane, and one right-turn lane. How many ways can the cars stack up so that all three lanes are occupied?

Note that if the first car turns left and the second goes straight, this is considered different from the first car going straight and the second car turning left. In other words, the cars are distinguishable, but pull up to the intersection in a fixed order.

Okay, let me try to figure out this problem.
So, there are six cars arriving one after another at a traffic light with three lanes: left-turn, straight, and right-turn.
We need to find how many ways they can arrange themselves such that all three lanes have at least one car.
The cars are distinguishable, and their order of arrival matters.
Hmm, so each car has a choice of three lanes, but we need to make sure none of the lanes are empty.
First, since the cars are arriving one at a time, each car can choose any of the three lanes independently, right?
So, if there were no restrictions, the total number of arrangements would be 3^6, because each of the six cars has three choices.
That would be 729 total possible ways.
But the problem states that all three lanes must be occupied.
So we have to subtract the cases where one or more lanes are empty.
This sounds like the principle of inclusion-exclusion.
Let me recall how that works.
Inclusion-exclusion principle is used to subtract the overlapping cases.
So, to find the number of surjective functions (or in this case, arrangements) where each lane has at least one car, we start with the total number of functions, subtract the ones missing at least one lane, add back the ones missing at least two lanes, and so on.
Wait, but here, it's not exactly functions.
Each car is assigned to a lane, so yes, it is similar to functions from a set of six cars to a set of three lanes.
Since the cars are distinguishable, the assignments matter.
So, the number of surjections from a set of size 6 to a set of size 3 is what we need.
The formula for the number of surjections is 3^6 - C(3,1)*2^6 + C(3,2)*1^6.
Let me break that down.
First, subtract the cases where at least one lane is missing.
There are C(3,1) = 3 ways to choose a lane to be missing, and then each car has two choices.
So 3*2^6.
But then, if we subtract all of these, we subtract too much because the cases where two lanes are missing are subtracted twice.
So we need to add those back once.
The number of ways to choose two lanes to be missing is C(3,2) = 3, and then each car has one choice.
So 3*1^6.
Therefore, the formula is 3^6 - 3*2^6 + 3*1^6.
Let me compute each term.
3^6 is 729.
2^6 is 64, so 3*64 is 192.
1^6 is 1, so 3*1 is 3.
Therefore, the calculation is 729 - 192 + 3.
Let's compute that step by step.
729 - 192 is 537.
537 + 3 is 540.
So 540.
Is that the answer?
Wait, but hold on.
Let me think if I applied the inclusion-exclusion correctly here.
The principle says that for surjections from a set A to a set B, the number is equal to the sum over k from 0 to |B| of (-1)^k * C(|B|, k) * (|B| - k)^|A|.
So in this case, |A| = 6 (cars), |B| = 3 (lanes).
Therefore, the number is C(3,0)*(3)^6 - C(3,1)*(2)^6 + C(3,2)*(1)^6 - C(3,3)*(0)^6.
But since 0^6 is 0, the last term disappears.
So that's 1*729 - 3*64 + 3*1 = 729 - 192 + 3 = 540.
Yes, that seems correct.
Therefore, 540 is the number of surjective functions from the six cars to the three lanes, meaning each lane has at least one car.
But wait, the problem says "how many ways can the cars stack up so that all three lanes are occupied?"
Since the cars are distinguishable and pull up in a fixed order, does that mean that the order of the cars in the lanes matters?
Wait, maybe I need to clarify.
The problem statement says: "how many ways can the cars stack up so that all three lanes are occupied?"
The cars are distinguishable, but pull up to the intersection in a fixed order.
Hmm.
Wait, maybe the key here is that the cars are arriving one at a time, but once they arrive, they can choose any lane, and the order in which they stack up in the lanes doesn't matter because they are already ordered by their arrival time?
Wait, no.
Wait, actually, the problem says the cars are distinguishable and pull up in a fixed order.
So perhaps the arrangement is determined by which car goes into which lane, considering their order.
Wait, but when they arrive one at a time, each subsequent car has to pull into a lane behind the car in front of them.
So the order of the cars in the lanes is fixed by their arrival order.
Wait, but the problem says "stack up", so the vertical order (the order they stop at the traffic light) is determined by their arrival order.
So the first car arrives and chooses a lane, then the second car arrives and has to stop behind the first car if they chose the same lane, or in their own position if the lane is empty.
But since it's a red light, they all stop in a line, so the vertical order is fixed.
However, the horizontal lanes they choose can vary.
But the problem statement says that the cars are distinguishable.
So perhaps the arrangement is determined by which lane each car takes, and since they are distinguishable, different assignments of cars to lanes result in different stackups, even if they are in the same lane.
Wait, but the problem says "how many ways can the cars stack up", so the "stacking" refers to the combination of which lane each car is in, considering their original order.
Wait, maybe the answer is indeed 540, because each surjective function corresponds to assigning each car to a lane such that all lanes are occupied.
Since the cars are distinguishable, their order in the assignments matters, but since they arrive in a fixed order, perhaps the only thing that matters is which lane each car takes.
Wait, but no, if the first car takes the left lane and the second car takes the straight lane, that's different from the first car taking the straight lane and the second car taking the left lane.
However, in this problem, the cars are distinguishable, but the order in which they arrive is fixed.
Wait, the problem says: "the cars are distinguishable, but pull up to the intersection in a fixed order."
Therefore, their order of arrival is fixed, so the only choices being made are each car choosing a lane when they arrive.
Each car, upon arrival, can choose any of the three lanes, following the cars that are already there.
Since the cars are distinguishable, different assignments of lanes to the cars result in different stackings.
Therefore, the number of ways they can stack up is the number of functions from the set of cars to the set of lanes, minus those functions where one or more lanes aren't used.
So exactly the surjective functions.
So the answer is 540.
But let me confirm with another approach.
Suppose we have six cars, each assigned to one of three lanes.
The assignment is a sequence of three elements (lanes) of length six (one for each car).
Each position in the sequence is a lane assignment for the corresponding arriving car.
The number of such sequences is 3^6.
However, we need the sequences where all three lanes appear at least once.
So that's equivalent to the number of surjective functions from the set of six cars to the set of three lanes.
As calculated before, 3^6 - 3*2^6 + 3*1^6 = 540.
Therefore, that should be correct.
Another way to think about it is that each car's lane choice is independent, and we need to count the assignments where no lane is empty.
So the answer is indeed 540.
But wait, just to make sure, let's consider a smaller case.
Suppose there are three cars and two lanes, and we need to count the number of ways they can stack up so that both lanes are occupied.
Then total number of assignments is 2^3 = 8.
The number of surjective assignments would be 2^3 - 2*1^3 = 8 - 2 = 6.
Which is correct, because each car must choose a lane, and we subtract the cases where all cars go to one lane (two such cases).
So that does make sense.
Similarly, in our original problem, with three lanes and six cars, using inclusion-exclusion gives 3^6 - 3*2^6 + 3*1^6 = 540.
Therefore, I think 540 is the correct answer.
But just to check if there's another interpretation.
What if the problem meant that the order in which the cars enter the lanes matters?
For example, if the first car takes the left lane and the second takes the straight lane, versus first straight then left, but since they are distinguishable, their actual positions in the lanes are fixed by their arrival order.
Wait, but since they arrive one at a time, their positions in the lane are determined by the order they arrive.
So, for example, the first car to enter a lane is at the front, followed by the next car in that lane, etc.
However, since the problem says the cars are distinguishable, then even if they are in the same lane, their order is fixed by the arrival order.
Therefore, the only choice is which lane each car takes, leading to the number of surjective functions.
Therefore, I think the answer is indeed 540.
**Final Answer**
\boxed{540}
</Think>

Answer: To solve the problem of determining how many ways six distinguishable cars can stack up into three lanes (left-turn, straight-going, and right-turn) such that all three lanes are occupied, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

1. **Total number of arrangements**: Each car has 3 choices, so the total number of arrangements is \(3^6 = 729\).

2. **Subtract the cases where at least one lane is empty**: There are \(\binom{3}{1}\) ways to choose a lane to be empty, and for each choice, the cars have 2 lanes left. Thus, the number of arrangements is \(\binom{3}{1} \cdot 2^6 = 3 \cdot 64 = 192\).

3. **Add back the cases where at least two lanes are empty**: There are \(\binom{3}{2}\) ways to choose two lanes to be empty, and for each choice, the cars have 1 lane left. Thus, the number of arrangements is \(\binom{3}{2} \cdot 1^6 = 3 \cdot 1 = 3\).

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the number of surjective functions (arrangements where all three lanes are occupied) is:
\[
3^6 - \binom{3}{1} \cdot 2^6 + \binom{3}{2} \cdot 1^6 = 729 - 192 + 3 = 540
\]

Thus, the number of ways the cars can stack up so that all three lanes are occupied is \(\boxed{540}\).
