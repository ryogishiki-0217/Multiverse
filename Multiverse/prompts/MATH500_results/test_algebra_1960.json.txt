Okay, so I need to find the inverse function value for f inverse of 1/5, where the function f(x) is given as 2 divided by (x + 1).
Hmm, let me remember how inverse functions work.
If I want to find f^{-1}(1/5), that means I need to find the value of x such that f(x) equals 1/5.
So basically, solve the equation f(x) = 1/5 and whatever x is, that's the answer.
Let me write that out: f(x) = 1/5, so substituting the function, 2/(x + 1) = 1/5.
Then I can solve for x.
Let's see: cross-multiplying maybe?
So, 2 = (1/5)(x + 1).
Wait, no, if I have 2/(x + 1) = 1/5, then multiplying both sides by (x + 1) gives 2 = (x + 1)*(1/5).
Then, multiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the denominator: 2*5 = x + 1, so 10 = x + 1.
Subtract 1 from both sides: x = 9.
Let me verify that.
If x is 9, then f(9) = 2/(9 + 1) = 2/10 = 1/5.
That works.
So f inverse of 1/5 is 9.
Wait, so the answer is 9.
But just to make sure, let me think through the inverse function steps.
Alternatively, to find the inverse function, I would set y = f(x) = 2/(x + 1).
Then, swap x and y to solve for y?
So, starting with y = 2/(x + 1), swapping x and y gives x = 2/(y + 1).
Then solve for y.
Multiply both sides by (y + 1): x(y + 1) = 2.
Then divide both sides by x: y + 1 = 2/x.
Subtract 1 from both sides: y = (2/x) - 1.
So the inverse function f^{-1}(x) is (2/x) - 1.
Then, if I plug in 1/5 into this inverse function, f^{-1}(1/5) = (2/(1/5)) - 1 = 2*(5/1) - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9.
Same answer.
So whether I solve the equation f(x) = 1/5 for x or compute the inverse function and then evaluate, I get x = 9.
Therefore, the answer should be 9.
But let me check again for any possible mistakes.
Cross-multiplied: 2/(x + 1) = 1/5.
Cross-multiplying gives 2*5 = 1*(x + 1) → 10 = x + 1 → x = 9.
Yes, that's correct.
Alternatively, the inverse function: starting with y = 2/(x + 1).
Swap x and y: x = 2/(y + 1).
Solve for y: multiply both sides by (y + 1): x(y + 1) = 2.
Divide by x: y + 1 = 2/x.
Subtract 1: y = (2/x) - 1.
So f^{-1}(x) = (2/x) - 1.
Plugging in x = 1/5: 2/(1/5) is 10, minus 1 is 9.
All good.
So definitely the answer is 9.
**Final Answer**
the final answer is \boxed{9}

Answer: To find the value of \( f^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{5}\right) \) for the function \( f(x) = \frac{2}{x+1} \), we need to determine the value of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = \frac{1}{5} \).

Starting with the equation:
\[
\frac{2}{x+1} = \frac{1}{5}
\]

We solve for \( x \) by cross-multiplying:
\[
2 \cdot 5 = 1 \cdot (x + 1)
\]
\[
10 = x + 1
\]
\[
x = 10 - 1
\]
\[
x = 9
\]

To verify, we can substitute \( x = 9 \) back into the original function:
\[
f(9) = \frac{2}{9 + 1} = \frac{2}{10} = \frac{1}{5}
\]

This confirms that \( f(9) = \frac{1}{5} \), so \( f^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{5}\right) = 9 \).

Alternatively, we can find the inverse function \( f^{-1}(x) \). Starting with \( y = \frac{2}{x+1} \), we swap \( x \) and \( y \):
\[
x = \frac{2}{y+1}
\]

Solving for \( y \):
\[
x(y + 1) = 2
\]
\[
y + 1 = \frac{2}{x}
\]
\[
y = \frac{2}{x} - 1
\]

Thus, the inverse function is \( f^{-1}(x) = \frac{2}{x} - 1 \). Evaluating this at \( x = \frac{1}{5} \):
\[
f^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{5}\right) = \frac{2}{\frac{1}{5}} - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9
\]

Both methods confirm the result.

the final answer is \boxed{9}

answer: to find the value of \( f^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{5}\right) \) for the function \( f(x) = \frac{2}{x+1} \), we need to determine the value of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = \frac{1}{5} \).

starting with the equation:
\[
\frac{2}{x+1} = \frac{1}{5}
\]

we solve for \( x \) by cross-multiplying:
\[
2 \cdot 5 = 1 \cdot (x + 1)
\]
\[
10 = x + 1
\]
\[
x = 10 - 1
\]
\[
x = 9
\]

to verify, we can substitute \( x = 9 \) back into the original function:
\[
f(9) = \frac{2}{9 + 1} = \frac{2}{10} = \frac{1}{5}
\]

this confirms that \( f(9) = \frac{1}{5} \), so \( f^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{5}\right) = 9 \).

alternatively, we can find the inverse function \( f^{-1}(x) \). starting with \( y = \frac{2}{x+1} \), we swap \( x \) and \( y \):
\[
x = \frac{2}{y+1}
\]

solving for \( y \):
\[
x(y + 1) = 2
\]
\[
y + 1 = \frac{2}{x}
\]
\[
y = \frac{2}{x} - 1
\]

thus, the inverse function is \( f^{-1}(x) = \frac{2}{x} - 1 \). evaluating this at \( x = \frac{1}{5} \):
\[
f^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{5}\right) = \frac{2}{\frac{1}{5}} - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9
\]

both methods confirm the result.

the final answer is \boxed{9}
