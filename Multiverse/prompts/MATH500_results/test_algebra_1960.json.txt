Okay, so I need to find the value of f^{-1}(1/5) where f(x) is given by 2/(x + 1).
Hmm, let me recall how inverse functions work.
The inverse function, f^{-1}(y), undoes what f(x) does.
So, if I plug y into f^{-1}, it should give me the x such that f(x) = y.
That makes sense.
So, to find f^{-1}(1/5), I need to find the x for which f(x) equals 1/5.
Right?
So, essentially, I need to solve the equation 2/(x + 1) = 1/5 for x.
Then that x will be the value of f^{-1}(1/5).
Okay, so let's write that equation down:
2/(x + 1) = 1/5
Now, how do I solve for x here?
Let's think through this step by step.
First, I can cross-multiply to get rid of the denominators.
So, multiplying both sides by (x + 1) and 5, which are the denominators, should give me:
2 * 5 = 1 * (x + 1)
Wait, no, cross-multiplication would mean multiplying the numerator of one side by the denominator of the other.
So, cross-multiplying gives:
2 * 5 = 1 * (x + 1)
Which simplifies to:
10 = x + 1
Then, subtract 1 from both sides:
10 - 1 = x
So, x = 9
Wait, let me check that again.
If 2/(x + 1) = 1/5, cross-multiplied becomes 2*5 = (x +1)*1, so 10 = x + 1, hence x = 9.
Yes, that seems straightforward.
Let me check if that's correct.
Let's think in parallel.

1: The function f(9) is calculated as 2/(9 + 1), which simplifies to 2/10, resulting in 1/5.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The value 9 is considered as a potential candidate for f^{-1}(1/5) because the function f maps 9 to 1/5. The inverse function f^{-1} is designed to reverse this mapping, meaning f^{-1}(1/5) should return the original input, which is 9.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The calculation f(9) = 1/5 confirms that the original input x=9 produces the output 1/5. Consequently, the inverse function f^{-1} at 1/5 must yield the original x-value of 9.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Therefore, f^{-1}(1/5) is 9.
But let me verify this again.
Alternatively, maybe I can find the general inverse function f^{-1}(x) and then substitute 1/5 into it.
Let's see.
To find the inverse function, I would set y = f(x) = 2/(x + 1).
Then solve for x in terms of y.
Starting with y = 2/(x + 1).
Multiply both sides by (x + 1):
y(x + 1) = 2
Divide both sides by y:
x + 1 = 2/y
Subtract 1 from both sides:
x = (2/y) - 1
Therefore, the inverse function f^{-1}(y) is (2/y) - 1.
Then, to find f^{-1}(1/5), substitute y = 1/5 into this expression:
x = 2/(1/5) - 1 = 2*(5) - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9
Yes, same answer.
So that's a good check.
So regardless of whether I solve it directly by setting f(x) = 1/5 or compute the inverse function first, I get the answer as 9.
Therefore, the value is 9.
Let me just make sure I didn't skip any steps there.
So starting with finding the inverse function:
Given y = 2/(x + 1).
Solving for x:
First multiply both sides by (x + 1):
y(x + 1) = 2
Then divide by y (assuming y ≠ 0, which is okay since we're dealing with y = 1/5 here):
x + 1 = 2/y
Subtract 1 from both sides:
x = (2/y) - 1
Therefore, inverse function is f^{-1}(y) = (2/y) - 1.
Plugging y = 1/5 into that:
f^{-1}(1/5) = (2/(1/5)) - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9.
Perfect, same result.
Alternatively, if I had miscalculated while cross-multiplying the equation 2/(x + 1) = 1/5, but when I redid it step-by-step via finding the inverse function, I arrived at the same answer, which reassures me.
Alternatively, another way to check is to plug x = 9 into the original function and see if it gives 1/5.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{9}
</Think>

Answer: To find the value of \( f^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{5}\right) \) where \( f(x) = \dfrac{2}{x+1} \), we need to determine the value of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = \frac{1}{5} \).

Starting with the equation:
\[
\dfrac{2}{x+1} = \dfrac{1}{5}
\]

We cross-multiply to solve for \( x \):
\[
2 \cdot 5 = 1 \cdot (x + 1)
\]
\[
10 = x + 1
\]

Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get:
\[
x = 9
\]

To verify, we can substitute \( x = 9 \) back into the original function:
\[
f(9) = \dfrac{2}{9 + 1} = \dfrac{2}{10} = \dfrac{1}{5}
\]

This confirms that \( f(9) = \frac{1}{5} \), so the inverse function value is correct. Therefore, the value of \( f^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{5}\right) \) is \(\boxed{9}\).

**final answer**
\boxed{9}

answer: to find the value of \( f^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{5}\right) \) where \( f(x) = \dfrac{2}{x+1} \), we need to determine the value of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = \frac{1}{5} \).

starting with the equation:
\[
\dfrac{2}{x+1} = \dfrac{1}{5}
\]

we cross-multiply to solve for \( x \):
\[
2 \cdot 5 = 1 \cdot (x + 1)
\]
\[
10 = x + 1
\]

subtracting 1 from both sides, we get:
\[
x = 9
\]

to verify, we can substitute \( x = 9 \) back into the original function:
\[
f(9) = \dfrac{2}{9 + 1} = \dfrac{2}{10} = \dfrac{1}{5}
\]

this confirms that \( f(9) = \frac{1}{5} \), so the inverse function value is correct. therefore, the value of \( f^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{5}\right) \) is \(\boxed{9}\)
