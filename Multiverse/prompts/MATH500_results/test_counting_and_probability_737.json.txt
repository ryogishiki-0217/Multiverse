Okay, let's tackle this license plate problem. The question is: How many license plates can be formed if every license plate has 2 different letters (A through Z) followed by 2 different one-digit (0-9) numbers? Alright, so the format is two distinct letters followed by two distinct digits. I need to calculate the number of possible combinations. Let me break this down step by step.
First, let's handle the letters. There are 26 letters in the alphabet from A to Z. The problem states that the two letters must be different. So, for the first letter, I can choose any of the 26 letters. Then, for the second letter, since it has to be different from the first one, there will be 25 options left. Multiplying those together should give the number of ways to choose the two different letters. That is, 26 * 25. Now, moving on to the digits. The digits are from 0 to 9, so there are 10 possible digits. Similar to the letters, the two digits must be different. So, for the first digit, I can choose any of the 10 digits. Then, for the second digit, there are 9 remaining choices since it has to be different from the first digit. Therefore, the number of ways to choose the two different digits would be 10 * 9. Since the license plate structure is two letters followed by two digits, we can think of the entire license plate as having four positions: the first letter, second letter, first digit, and second digit. Because the letters and digits are in sequence, the total number of possible license plates would be the product of the number of choices for each position. Wait, but actually, when considering the letters and digits separately, the number of combinations for letters is 26 * 25, and for digits is 10 * 9. Since the letters come first and then the digits, the total combinations would be (26 * 25) * (10 * 9). That should be it. Let me confirm. Alternatively, maybe the problem is more complicated if we have to consider the letters and digits as separate groups. Wait, no, the problem states that the license plate has 2 different letters followed by 2 different one-digit numbers. So, each license plate has a structure of L L D D, where L represents a letter and D represents a digit, all of which are distinct as per their own group. Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "2 different letters" and "2 different one-digit numbers". That means that within the letters, they have to be different, and within the digits, they also have to be different. So, the first letter can be any of 26, the second letter any but different from the first, making 25. Similarly, first digit, 10 choices, second digit different from the first, so 9. Therefore, as I thought earlier, the total number of combinations is (26 * 25) * (10 * 9). Let me compute that. Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: The product of the number of choices for letters (26 * 25) and the product of the number of choices for digits (10 * 9) are computed.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: The intermediate product of the letter choices (26 * 25) is computed.
</Outline>
<Outline>
3: The intermediate product of the digit choices (10 * 9) is computed.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The total number of license plates is calculated by multiplying the product of the number of choices for letters (26 * 25) by the product of the number of choices for digits (10 * 9).
</Path>
<Path>
2: The product of the number of choices for letters, 26 multiplied by 25, equals 650.
</Path>
<Path>
3: The product of 10 and 9 is 90.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The intermediate product of the letter choices (26 * 25) is 650, and the intermediate product of the digit choices (10 * 9) is 90.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Therefore, 650 * 90. Let me calculate that. 650 * 90. Well, 650 * 9 is 5850, so 650 * 90 would be 58,500. So, 58,500. But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Wait, no. Wait, 26*25 is 650, 10*9 is 90, multiplying 650 by 90 gives 58,500. Hmm, but sometimes when排列组合, you need to consider whether order matters. Wait, in this case, the problem is about license plates where the order of the letters and digits matters. Because a license plate is a specific sequence: the first character is a letter, the second is another letter, then two digits. So, it's a permutation where the order matters. Therefore, we are doing permutations without replacement. So, for the letters, it's P(26,2), which is 26*25, and for the digits, it's P(10,2), which is 10*9. Therefore, multiplying those together is correct. So, 26*25*10*9 = 58,500. Therefore, the answer should be 58,500. Wait, but another way to think about it: if the letters have to be different and the digits have to be different, but the letters and digits are in separate positions. So, positions 1 and 2 are letters, positions 3 and 4 are digits, with no repetition within letters or within digits. So, indeed, for the letters: first position, 26 options, second position 25 options. For the digits: first digit, 10 options, second digit 9 options. Multiply all those: 26*25*10*9 = 58,500. That seems right. Let me just check another angle. Suppose instead we think of choosing the letters and digits separately. For the letters, since they need to be two different letters, the number of permutations is 26*25, as we said. For digits, similarly, 10*9. Since the letters and digits are separate, we multiply those possibilities together. Yes, that makes sense. So, the total number is (26*25)*(10*9) = 58,500. So, that's my conclusion. Wait, but maybe the problem is trickier if the letters and numbers cannot overlap in any way. Wait, no, the problem states "2 different letters... followed by 2 different one-digit numbers." So, there's no restriction on overlap between letters and numbers. Only that the letters must be different from each other, and the numbers must be different from each other. So, our previous calculation holds. Therefore, 58,500. I think that's correct. I don't see any reason to approach it differently. So, the final answer is 58,500. Wait, but let me confirm once more. Let's think: If the first two characters must be distinct letters, how many ways are there? For the first letter, 26 possibilities, then 25 for the second. So, 26*25=650. Then, for the last two characters, distinct digits. First digit: 10 choices, second digit: 9 choices. 10*9=90. Total: 650*90=58,500. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I calculate step by step: First character: 26 letters. Second character: 25 letters. Third character: 10 digits. Fourth character: 9 digits. Multiply all together: 26*25*10*9=58,500. Same result. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the answer is 58,500. Yes.
the final answer is 58,500
**Final Answer** 
\boxed{58500}
</Think>

Answer: To solve the problem of determining how many license plates can be formed with 2 different letters followed by 2 different one-digit numbers, we need to consider the permutations for both letters and digits separately and then combine them.

1. **Calculating the permutations for the letters:**
   - There are 26 letters in the alphabet.
   - The first letter can be any of the 26 letters.
   - The second letter must be different from the first, leaving 25 options.
   - Therefore, the number of ways to choose the two different letters is \(26 \times 25 = 650\).

2. **Calculating the permutations for the digits:**
   - There are 10 possible digits (0-9).
   - The first digit can be any of the 10 digits.
   - The second digit must be different from the first, leaving 9 options.
   - Therefore, the number of ways to choose the two different digits is \(10 \times 9 = 90\).

3. **Combining the permutations for letters and digits:**
   - The total number of license plates is the product of the number of ways to choose the letters and the number of ways to choose the digits.
   - This is calculated as \(650 \times 90 = 58,500\).

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{58500}\).

therefore, 650 * 90. let me calculate that. 650 * 90. well, 650 * 9 is 5850, so 650 * 90 would be 58,500. so, 58,500. but wait, is that correct? let me think again. wait, no. wait, 26*25 is 650, 10*9 is 90, multiplying 650 by 90 gives 58,500. hmm, but sometimes when排列组合, you need to consider whether order matters. wait, in this case, the problem is about license plates where the order of the letters and digits matters. because a license plate is a specific sequence: the first character is a letter, the second is another letter, then two digits. so, it's a permutation where the order matters. therefore, we are doing permutations without replacement. so, for the letters, it's p(26,2), which is 26*25, and for the digits, it's p(10,2), which is 10*9. therefore, multiplying those together is correct. so, 26*25*10*9 = 58,500. therefore, the answer should be 58,500. wait, but another way to think about it: if the letters have to be different and the digits have to be different, but the letters and digits are in separate positions. so, positions 1 and 2 are letters, positions 3 and 4 are digits, with no repetition within letters or within digits. so, indeed, for the letters: first position, 26 options, second position 25 options. for the digits: first digit, 10 options, second digit 9 options. multiply all those: 26*25*10*9 = 58,500. that seems right. let me just check another angle. suppose instead we think of choosing the letters and digits separately. for the letters, since they need to be two different letters, the number of permutations is 26*25, as we said. for digits, similarly, 10*9. since the letters and digits are separate, we multiply those possibilities together. yes, that makes sense. so, the total number is (26*25)*(10*9) = 58,500. so, that's my conclusion. wait, but maybe the problem is trickier if the letters and numbers cannot overlap in any way. wait, no, the problem states "2 different letters... followed by 2 different one-digit numbers." so, there's no restriction on overlap between letters and numbers. only that the letters must be different from each other, and the numbers must be different from each other. so, our previous calculation holds. therefore, 58,500. i think that's correct. i don't see any reason to approach it differently. so, the final answer is 58,500. wait, but let me confirm once more. let's think: if the first two characters must be distinct letters, how many ways are there? for the first letter, 26 possibilities, then 25 for the second. so, 26*25=650. then, for the last two characters, distinct digits. first digit: 10 choices, second digit: 9 choices. 10*9=90. total: 650*90=58,500. that seems correct. alternatively, if i calculate step by step: first character: 26 letters. second character: 25 letters. third character: 10 digits. fourth character: 9 digits. multiply all together: 26*25*10*9=58,500. same result. so, i think that's correct. therefore, the answer is 58,500. yes.

   - there are 26 letters in the alphabet.
   - the first letter can be any of the 26 letters.

2. **calculating the permutations for the digits:**
   - there are 10 possible digits (0-9).
   - the first digit can be any of the 10 digits.
   - the second digit must be different from the first, leaving 9 options.
   - therefore, the number of ways to choose the two different digits is \(10 \times 9 = 90\).

3. **combining the permutations for letters and digits:**
   - the total number of license plates is the product of the number of ways to choose the letters and the number of ways to choose the digits.
   - this is calculated as \(650 \times 90 = 58,500\).

thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{58500}\)
