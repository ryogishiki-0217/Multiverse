Okay, let's tackle this license plate problem. The question is asking how many different license plates can be formed if each plate has 2 different letters (from A to Z) followed by 2 different one-digit numbers (0 to 9). Hmm, so the structure is two letters and then two numbers, right? And all the characters have to be different. Let me make sure I understand this correctly.
First, the letters are from A to Z, which is 26 letters in total. The numbers are from 0 to 9, which gives 10 digits. The key here is that the letters and numbers have to be different. So, the first two characters are letters, which can't be the same, and the last two characters are numbers, also can't be the same. I think the problem is saying that each license plate has two distinct letters followed by two distinct numbers. They're not saying that all four characters have to be unique, right? Because that would be a bit different. Let me check the problem statement again: "2 different letters... followed by 2 different one digit numbers". So, each pair (letters and numbers) have to be different from each other, but maybe letters can be same as numbers? Wait, no. Wait, the question says "2 different letters... followed by 2 different one digit (0-9) numbers". So, the two letters must be different from each other, and the two numbers must also be different from each other. But the letters and numbers don't have to be different from each other. Wait, but letters are letters and numbers are numbers, so in that case, even if a letter and a number are the same character, like 'A' and '1', they're not the same. So, actually, since letters and numbers are different character sets, they can't repeat in the same plate. Wait, no. For example, if the first letter is 'A' and the first number is '1', there's no possibility of them conflicting. Wait, but maybe the problem is not saying that letters and numbers have to be unique across the entire plate, just that the two letters are different and the two numbers are different. So, the first two characters (letters) must be unique, and the last two characters (numbers) must be unique. So, the first letter can't be the same as the second letter, and the first number can't be the same as the second number. But a letter can be the same as a number in the sense that a letter and a number can be the same character? Wait, but letters and numbers are different, so 'A' and 'A' would be a duplicate letter, but 'A' and '1' are different. Wait, I think the problem is about having two distinct letters and two distinct numbers, regardless of their positions. Wait, no. The problem says "license plates that have 2 different letters... followed by 2 different one digit numbers". So, the letters are in the first two positions, and must be different from each other, and the numbers are in the last two positions, must be different from each other. So, the first two characters are letters, no repeats, and the last two are numbers, no repeats. That's what the problem is saying. So, letters can be any two different letters arranged in the first two spots, numbers can be any two different numbers arranged in the last two spots. So, to calculate the total number, we can compute the number of possibilities for the letters and multiply by the number of possibilities for the numbers. For the letters: How many ways to choose 2 different letters from 26 and arrange them in order. Similarly, for the numbers: How many ways to choose 2 different digits from 10 and arrange them in order. So, this is a permutation problem. For the letters, it's P(26,2), which is 26 * 25, because the first letter can be any of 26, and the second letter any of the remaining 25. Similarly, for the numbers, it's P(10,2), which is 10 * 9, since first digit has 10 choices, second digit has 9 remaining choices. Therefore, the total number of license plates is 26 * 25 * 10 * 9. Let me calculate that. First, 26 * 25 is 650. 10 * 9 is 90. Then 650 * 90. Let's compute 650 * 90. 650 * 9 is 5850, so 650 * 90 is 58,500. Wait, so total is 58,500. But, wait, let me check again. The problem says "license plates can be formed if every license plate has 2 different letters (A through Z) followed by 2 different one digit (0-9) numbers". So yes, the structure is LLNN, where L's are unique letters and N's are unique numbers. So, letters first, then numbers. So the calculation is correct. 26*25 for the letters, 10*9 for the numbers, multiplied together. So 26*25*10*9 = 58,500. But to confirm, let's break it down step by step. First position (letter): 26 options. Second position (different letter): 25 options. Third position (first number): 10 options. Fourth position (different number): 9 options. So total combinations: 26 * 25 * 10 * 9 = 58,500. Wait, that seems right. Alternatively, if the problem required all four characters to be unique, regardless of being letters or numbers, that would be a different calculation. For example, if letters and numbers are considered together for uniqueness, then it's a permutation of 26+10=36 characters, choosing 4, but with the first two being letters and the last two being numbers. However, the problem doesn't specify that. It only says that the two letters must be different, and the two numbers must be different. So, as long as the letters are unique in their positions and numbers are unique in their positions, it's allowed. Therefore, the calculation is correct. Wait, but another way to think about it: permutations of letters and permutations of numbers multiplied together. So, permutations of 26 letters taken 2 at a time is 26*25, and permutations of 10 numbers taken 2 at a time is 10*9. Multiply those together, yes, 26*25*10*9. So 26*10=260, 25*9=225. Then 260*225. Wait, but earlier I did 26*25*10*9 as (26*25)*(10*9)=650*90=58,500. But 26*25*10*9 can also be grouped as (26*10)*(25*9)=260*225. Let's compute that: 260*225. 260*200=52,000; 260*25=6,500. So total 52,000+6,500=58,500. Same result. So that's correct. But to be absolutely sure, maybe think of it as the first letter has 26 possibilities, second letter has 25. First number has 10, second number has 9. So each choice is independent, so multiplying is the correct approach. So 26*25*10*9=58,500. Wait, but another way, using permutations: for letters, it's 26P2, which is 26! / (26-2)! = 26*25. Similarly, numbers are 10P2 = 10*9. Then multiply the two together. So yes, that's the correct approach. So the answer is 58,500. But I want to make sure there's no additional constraints. The problem statement doesn't say anything about the letters or numbers needing to be in alphabetical or numerical order, so it's safe to assume that it's permutations (order matters), which is the case for license plates. Yes, license plates are usually permutations because the order of characters matters. So, conclusion: the total number is 58,500. Wait, but maybe the problem is a trick one, like maybe the letters and numbers cannot repeat across the entire plate. But the problem states "every license plate has 2 different letters... followed by 2 different one digit numbers", which suggests that it's only within the letters and within the numbers that they have to be different. Because if it was the case that all characters on the plate must be unique, it would say "two different letters and two different one-digit numbers" without specifying "followed by". The wording here is key. Since it says "2 different letters... followed by 2 different one digit numbers", this implies that the letters need to be different from each other, and the numbers need to be different from each other. So letters can be the same as numbers (but letters and numbers are different character sets, so 'A' is different from '1'), but the key is that the two letters are distinct and the two numbers are distinct. So the answer is indeed 26*25*10*9=58,500. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, if we had to consider that letters and numbers could not repeat at all (so for example, if the first letter is 'A', then no number can be '1', but that's a bit of a stretch and the problem doesn't mention that). Since letters are letters and numbers are numbers, their character sets are separate, so repeating in the sense of same character in different types (like 'A' and '1') isn't considered repeating. So, in that case, the answer is correct. So, final answer is 58,500. But let me check one more time. 26 letters, first letter any of 26, second letter any of 25 remaining. For numbers, first number any of 10, second number any of 9 remaining. So 26 * 25 * 10 * 9 = 58,500. Yeah, that's right. So, no doubt here. The answer is 58,500.

Answer: The problem asks how many license plates can be formed with 2 different letters followed by 2 different one-digit numbers. 

First, we calculate the number of ways to choose and arrange the two different letters. There are 26 choices for the first letter and 25 choices for the second letter (since it must be different from the first). This gives us \(26 \times 25\) possibilities for the letters.

Next, we calculate the number of ways to choose and arrange the two different one-digit numbers. There are 10 choices for the first digit and 9 choices for the second digit (since it must be different from the first). This gives us \(10 \times 9\) possibilities for the numbers.

To find the total number of license plates, we multiply the possibilities for the letters by the possibilities for the numbers:

\[
26 \times 25 \times 10 \times 9 = 26 \times 25 \times 90 = 650 \times 90 = 58,500
\]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{58500}\).
