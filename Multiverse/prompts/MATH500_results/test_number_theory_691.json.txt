Okay, so the problem is asking for the largest eight-digit base 2 integer and to express that in base 10. Hmm, let's break this down.
First, I need to recall what an eight-digit base 2 (binary) number means. In binary, each digit is a power of 2, right? Starting from the rightmost digit, which is 2^0, then 2^1, 2^2, and so on. So, an eight-digit binary number would have digits corresponding to 2^0 up to 2^7. But wait, if it's eight digits, does that include leading zeros? Probably not, because the largest number would mean all the digits are 1s. Let's confirm that.
In binary, the largest number with a certain number of digits is all 1s. For example, the largest single-digit binary number is 1 (which is 1 in decimal), the largest two-digit binary number is 11 (which is 3 in decimal), and so on. So, extending that logic, the largest eight-digit binary number would be 11111111 in binary. Now, I need to convert that to base 10.
Converting binary to decimal is straightforward. Each bit is multiplied by 2 raised to its position index, starting from 0 on the right. So, for 11111111, each digit is 1, so we can calculate the decimal value by summing up 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^4 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0.
Alternatively, there's a formula for this. Since it's all 1s, it's equal to 2^n - 1, where n is the number of digits. Wait, if the number has n digits in binary, then the value is 2^(n) - 1. Wait, let me verify that. For example, two digits: 11 in binary is 3, which is 2^2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3. Similarly, three digits: 111 in binary is 7, which is 2^3 - 1 = 7. So yes, that formula holds. Therefore, for an eight-digit binary number, the largest number is 2^8 - 1. But wait, hold on. Let's clarify.
Wait, when they say eight-digit base 2 integer, does that mean a binary number with exactly eight digits, which would range from 10000000 to 11111111 in binary? Because if it's an eight-digit number, it has to start with 1, right? Otherwise, it would be a shorter number with leading zeros, but in binary representation, leading zeros aren't counted usually. So, the largest eight-digit binary number would indeed be 11111111, which is 2^8 - 1. But 2^8 is 256, so 256 - 1 is 255. So, is the answer 255? Let me check again.
Wait, maybe to confirm, let's count the digits. 11111111 in binary has eight digits, from the leftmost 1 which is 2^7 to the rightmost 1 which is 2^0. So, adding all those up: 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 255. So yes, that's correct. Alternatively, 2^8 is 256, so 2^8 -1 is 255, which is 11111111 in binary. So that seems right.
But just to make sure there's not a trick here. The question says "the largest eight-digit base 2 integer". So, eight digits in base 2. So, the maximum number would be all 1's. That's correct. Then converting that to base 10. So, as I thought, either summing each binary digit's value or using 2^n -1 where n is 8. So 255.
Wait, just one second. Let me verify with another example. Let's say a 3-digit binary integer. The largest would be 111, which is 7 in decimal, which is 2^3 -1 = 7. Similarly, 4 digits: 1111 which is 15, 2^4 -1=15. So yes, same pattern. Therefore, 8 digits: 2^8 -1 is 255. So the answer is 255.
But let me just recompute 2^8 -1. 2^8 is 256. So 256 -1 is 255. Yep. So, the final answer should be 255.
Let me think if there's any other interpretation. Maybe the user meant an eight-digit number in base 2, but in base 10, it's a different length. But the question says "the largest eight-digit base 2 integer" which needs to be expressed in base 10. So, the number is an eight-digit base 2 number, meaning it's a binary number with eight digits (11111111), and we need to write that in base 10. So, 255 is correct.
Alternatively, maybe they think eight digits in binary is from 10000000 to 11111111, so 128 to 255 in decimal. Then the largest would be 255. So yes. So the answer is 255.
But just to be thorough, let's compute 11111111 binary to decimal manually. Starting from the right:
1 * 2^0 = 1
1 * 2^1 = 2
1 * 2^2 = 4
1 * 2^3 = 8
1 * 2^4 = 16
1 * 2^5 = 32
1 * 2^6 = 64
1 * 2^7 = 128
Now, adding them all up: 1 + 2 = 3, 3 + 4 = 7, 7 + 8 = 15, 15 + 16 = 31, 31 + 32 = 63, 63 + 64 = 127, 127 + 128 = 255. Yep, that's 255.
So, another way, the formula for the sum of a geometric series: the sum is 2^0 + 2^1 + ... + 2^7. The sum can be calculated as (2^(7+1) - 1)/(2 - 1) ) = 2^8 -1 = 255. Same result.
Therefore, the answer is definitely 255. So I can conclude that.
**Final Answer**
\boxed{255}

Answer: To solve the problem of finding the largest eight-digit base 2 integer and expressing it in base 10, we start by understanding that the largest eight-digit binary number is 11111111. This is because in binary, each digit is a power of 2, and the largest number is formed by setting all digits to 1.

We then convert the binary number 11111111 to its decimal (base 10) equivalent. This can be done by summing the powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^7\):

\[
1 \cdot 2^7 + 1 \cdot 2^6 + 1 \cdot 2^5 + 1 \cdot 2^4 + 1 \cdot 2^3 + 1 \cdot 2^2 + 1 \cdot 2^1 + 1 \cdot 2^0
\]

Calculating each term, we get:

\[
128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1
\]

Adding these values step-by-step:

\[
128 + 64 = 192
\]
\[
192 + 32 = 224
\]
\[
224 + 16 = 240
\]
\[
240 + 8 = 248
\]
\[
248 + 4 = 252
\]
\[
252 + 2 = 254
\]
\[
254 + 1 = 255
\]

Thus, the sum of these values is 255. Alternatively, we can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series, which gives \(2^8 - 1 = 255\).

Therefore, the largest eight-digit base 2 integer expressed in base 10 is \(\boxed{255}\).

the final answer is \boxed{255}

\]

calculating each term, we get:

\[
128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1
\]

adding these values step-by-step:

\[
128 + 64 = 192
\]
\[
192 + 32 = 224
\]
\[
224 + 16 = 240
\]
\[
240 + 8 = 248
\]
\[
248 + 4 = 252
\]
\[
252 + 2 = 254
\]
\[
254 + 1 = 255
\]

thus, the sum of these values is 255. alternatively, we can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series, which gives \(2^8 - 1 = 255\).

therefore, the largest eight-digit base 2 integer expressed in base 10 is \(\boxed{255}\).
