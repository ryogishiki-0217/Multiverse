Okay, let's see. I need to find the product CD where C and D are integers that satisfy this equation:

\[\frac{C}{x-3}+\frac{D}{x+8}=\frac{4x-23}{x^2+5x-24}\]

for all real x except -8 and 3. First, I remember that when dealing with partial fractions, the denominator on the right side is usually factored, and then we express it as the sum of two fractions with denominators being the factors. Here, the denominator is already factored as (x - 3)(x + 8). That's good. The right side is:

\[\frac{4x -23}{(x -3)(x +8)}\]

So, they want us to decompose this into partial fractions over integers C and D. The equation is already set up as:

\[\frac{C}{x-3} + \frac{D}{x+8} = \frac{4x -23}{(x -3)(x +8)}\]

Next step is to combine the left side over a common denominator, which should be (x -3)(x +8). Let's do that.

So:

\[\frac{C(x + 8) + D(x -3)}{(x -3)(x +8)} = \frac{4x -23}{(x -3)(x +8)}\]

Since the denominators are the same, the numerators must be equal. Therefore:

\[C(x + 8) + D(x -3) = 4x -23\]

Now, we need to find integers C and D such that this equation holds for all x except -8 and 3. To do this, we can expand the left side and then set the coefficients of x and the constant terms equal on both sides. Let's try that.

Expanding the left side:

C(x) + 8C + D(x) -3D = 4x -23

Combine like terms:

(C + D)x + (8C -3D) = 4x -23

Now, the coefficients of x on both sides must be equal, and the constant terms must be equal. So, we can set up a system of equations:

1. Coefficient of x: C + D = 4
2. Constant term: 8C -3D = -23

Great. Now we have a system of linear equations:

1) C + D = 4
2) 8C -3D = -23

We can solve this system for C and D. Let's use substitution or elimination. Maybe elimination is straightforward here.

First, from equation 1), we can express D as D = 4 - C. Then substitute into equation 2).

So substituting D into equation 2):

8C -3(4 - C) = -23

Expand:

8C -12 + 3C = -23

Combine like terms:

11C -12 = -23

Add 12 to both sides:

11C = -23 + 12

11C = -11

Divide by 11:

C = -1

Then, substitute back C = -1 into equation 1):

-1 + D = 4 => D = 4 +1 = 5

So, C = -1 and D = 5. Let me check if these values satisfy both equations.

Check equation 1: C + D = -1 + 5 = 4. Correct.

Check equation 2: 8*(-1) -3*5 = -8 -15 = -23. Correct. Good.

Therefore, C = -1 and D = 5. The problem asks for the product CD. So, multiply them: (-1)*(5) = -5.

Wait, but let me just double-check the calculations to be safe.

So C = -1, D = 5. Their sum is 4, okay. Then 8*(-1) is -8, 5*-3 is -15. -8 -15 = -23. Yep, that matches. So that's correct.

Therefore, CD is -5. But I need to make sure. Wait, is there another way to check?

Alternatively, plug back the values of C and D into the original equation and see if it holds for some value of x, not -8 or 3. Let's pick a random x, say x=0.

Left side: C/(0 -3) + D/(0 +8) = (-1)/(-3) + 5/8 = 1/3 + 5/8 = 8/24 + 15/24 = 23/24

Right side: (4*0 -23)/(0^2 +5*0 -24) = (-23)/(-24) = 23/24. Yep, matches. Another x, like x=1.

Left side: (-1)/(1 -3) + 5/(1 +8) = (-1)/(-2) +5/9 = 1/2 +5/9= 9/18 +10/18=19/18

Right side: (4*1 -23)/(1 +5*1 -24) = (4 -23)/(1 +5 -24) = (-19)/(-18) = 19/18. Also matches. Good.

Therefore, the values are correct. So product is CD = (-1)*5 = -5. The answer is -5.

Wait, but the problem says "the integers C and D". They have to be integers. Here, C=-1 and D=5 are integers. So that's okay.

Alternatively, is there another possible pair? Let me see. The equations are:

C + D =4

8C -3D = -23

This is a determined system (two equations, two unknowns). The solution is unique. Solving via substitution or elimination gives us the only solution. So C=-1, D=5 is the only solution, which are integers. So that's correct.

Therefore, the product is -5. So I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{-5}

Answer: To find the product \( CD \) of the integers \( C \) and \( D \) for which

\[
\frac{C}{x-3} + \frac{D}{x+8} = \frac{4x-23}{x^2+5x-24}
\]

for all real values of \( x \) except \( -8 \) and \( 3 \), we start by combining the fractions on the left-hand side over a common denominator:

\[
\frac{C(x + 8) + D(x - 3)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)} = \frac{4x - 23}{(x - 3)(x + 8)}
\]

Since the denominators are the same, we equate the numerators:

\[
C(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = 4x - 23
\]

Expanding and combining like terms, we get:

\[
(C + D)x + (8C - 3D) = 4x - 23
\]

This gives us a system of linear equations by comparing coefficients:

1. \( C + D = 4 \)
2. \( 8C - 3D = -23 \)

We solve this system using substitution. From the first equation, \( D = 4 - C \). Substituting into the second equation:

\[
8C - 3(4 - C) = -23
\]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[
8C - 12 + 3C = -23 \\
11C - 12 = -23 \\
11C = -11 \\
C = -1
\]

Substituting \( C = -1 \) back into \( D = 4 - C \):

\[
D = 4 - (-1) = 5
\]

Thus, the integers are \( C = -1 \) and \( D = 5 \). The product \( CD \) is:

\[
CD = (-1)(5) = -5
\]

Verifying with \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 1 \) confirms the solution. Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{-5}
\]

okay, let's see. i need to find the product cd where c and d are integers that satisfy this equation:

\[\frac{c}{x-3}+\frac{d}{x+8}=\frac{4x-23}{x^2+5x-24}\]

for all real x except -8 and 3. first, i remember that when dealing with partial fractions, the denominator on the right side is usually factored, and then we express it as the sum of two fractions with denominators being the factors. here, the denominator is already factored as (x - 3)(x + 8). that's good. the right side is:

so, they want us to decompose this into partial fractions over integers c and d. the equation is already set up as:

\[\frac{c}{x-3} + \frac{d}{x+8} = \frac{4x -23}{(x -3)(x +8)}\]

next step is to combine the left side over a common denominator, which should be (x -3)(x +8). let's do that.

so:

\[\frac{c(x + 8) + d(x -3)}{(x -3)(x +8)} = \frac{4x -23}{(x -3)(x +8)}\]

since the denominators are the same, the numerators must be equal. therefore:

\[c(x + 8) + d(x -3) = 4x -23\]

now, we need to find integers c and d such that this equation holds for all x except -8 and 3. to do this, we can expand the left side and then set the coefficients of x and the constant terms equal on both sides. let's try that.

expanding the left side:

c(x) + 8c + d(x) -3d = 4x -23

combine like terms:

(c + d)x + (8c -3d) = 4x -23

now, the coefficients of x on both sides must be equal, and the constant terms must be equal. so, we can set up a system of equations:

1. coefficient of x: c + d = 4
2. constant term: 8c -3d = -23

great. now we have a system of linear equations:

1) c + d = 4
2) 8c -3d = -23

we can solve this system for c and d. let's use substitution or elimination. maybe elimination is straightforward here.

first, from equation 1), we can express d as d = 4 - c. then substitute into equation 2).

so substituting d into equation 2):

8c -3(4 - c) = -23

expand:

8c -12 + 3c = -23

combine like terms:

11c -12 = -23

add 12 to both sides:

11c = -23 + 12

11c = -11

divide by 11:

c = -1

then, substitute back c = -1 into equation 1):

-1 + d = 4 => d = 4 +1 = 5

so, c = -1 and d = 5. let me check if these values satisfy both equations.

check equation 1: c + d = -1 + 5 = 4. correct.

check equation 2: 8*(-1) -3*5 = -8 -15 = -23. correct. good.

therefore, c = -1 and d = 5. the problem asks for the product cd. so, multiply them: (-1)*(5) = -5.

wait, but let me just double-check the calculations to be safe.

so c = -1, d = 5. their sum is 4, okay. then 8*(-1) is -8, 5*-3 is -15. -8 -15 = -23. yep, that matches. so that's correct.

therefore, cd is -5. but i need to make sure. wait, is there another way to check?

alternatively, plug back the values of c and d into the original equation and see if it holds for some value of x, not -8 or 3. let's pick a random x, say x=0.

left side: c/(0 -3) + d/(0 +8) = (-1)/(-3) + 5/8 = 1/3 + 5/8 = 8/24 + 15/24 = 23/24

right side: (4*0 -23)/(0^2 +5*0 -24) = (-23)/(-24) = 23/24. yep, matches. another x, like x=1.

left side: (-1)/(1 -3) + 5/(1 +8) = (-1)/(-2) +5/9 = 1/2 +5/9= 9/18 +10/18=19/18

right side: (4*1 -23)/(1 +5*1 -24) = (4 -23)/(1 +5 -24) = (-19)/(-18) = 19/18. also matches. good.

therefore, the values are correct. so product is cd = (-1)*5 = -5. the answer is -5.

wait, but the problem says "the integers c and d". they have to be integers. here, c=-1 and d=5 are integers. so that's okay.

alternatively, is there another possible pair? let me see. the equations are:

c + d =4

8c -3d = -23

this is a determined system (two equations, two unknowns). the solution is unique. solving via substitution or elimination gives us the only solution. so c=-1, d=5 is the only solution, which are integers. so that's correct.

therefore, the product is -5. so i think that's the answer.

answer: to find the product \( cd \) of the integers \( c \) and \( d \) for which

\[
\frac{c}{x-3} + \frac{d}{x+8} = \frac{4x-23}{x^2+5x-24}

for all real values of \( x \) except \( -8 \) and \( 3 \), we start by combining the fractions on the left-hand side over a common denominator:

\[
\frac{c(x + 8) + d(x - 3)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)} = \frac{4x - 23}{(x - 3)(x + 8)}
\]

since the denominators are the same, we equate the numerators:

\[
c(x + 8) + d(x - 3) = 4x - 23
\]

expanding and combining like terms, we get:

\[
(c + d)x + (8c - 3d) = 4x - 23
\]

this gives us a system of linear equations by comparing coefficients:

1. \( c + d = 4 \)
2. \( 8c - 3d = -23 \)

we solve this system using substitution. from the first equation, \( d = 4 - c \). substituting into the second equation:

\[
8c - 3(4 - c) = -23
\]

expanding and simplifying:

\[
8c - 12 + 3c = -23 \\
11c - 12 = -23 \\
11c = -11 \\
c = -1
\]

substituting \( c = -1 \) back into \( d = 4 - c \):

\[
d = 4 - (-1) = 5
\]

thus, the integers are \( c = -1 \) and \( d = 5 \). the product \( cd \) is:

\[
cd = (-1)(5) = -5
\]

verifying with \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 1 \) confirms the solution. therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{-5}
