Okay, so I need to find the area of a triangle with sides measuring 5, 5, and 6 units. Hmm, let's think. I know there are different formulas for the area of a triangle, like the base times height divided by 2, or Heron's formula. Which one to use here?

1: The triangle is isosceles because two sides are equal (5, 5, 6). In an isosceles triangle, the base can be considered as the side that's different (which is 6 here), and the other two sides are equal (5 each). If I draw this triangle, with the base being 6 units, then the height can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. If I split the base in half, from the apex to the midpoint of the base, that line is the height. This splits the isosceles triangle into two right-angled triangles. Each right triangle would have a hypotenuse of 5 (the side of the original triangle), one leg as half the base, which is 3, and the other leg as the height. So, using Pythagoras: (hypotenuse)^2 = (leg1)^2 + (leg2)^2. Here, 5^2 = 3^2 + h^2. So, 25 = 9 + h^2. Therefore, h^2 = 16. Therefore, h = 4. Got height 4. Therefore, the area of the triangle is (base * height)/2. So, base is 6, height is 4. Area = (6 * 4)/2 = 24/2 = 12. So the area is 12 square units. Alternatively, Heron's formula. Let me check. Heron's formula is useful for any triangle when you have all three sides. The formula is sqrt[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)], where s is semi-perimeter. But maybe that's more complicated here. Since the triangle is isocelesles, splitting it to find height was easier. But just to check, let's do Heron's formula. Semi-perimeter s = (5+5+6)/2 = 16/2 = 8. Then area = sqrt[8*(8-5)(8-5)(8-6)] = sqrt[8*3*3*2] = sqrt[8*9*2] = sqrt[144] = 12. Yep, same answer. So both methods confirm the area is 12. But since the triangle is isosceles, finding the height via Pythagorean theorem is straightforward. Probably the intended method here. So the answer is 12.

2: Wait, maybe Heron's formula would work here more straightforwardly. Heron's formula is useful when you have all three sides. The formula is the square root of [s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)], where s is the semi-perimeter. Let me recall that. So, first, calculate the semi-perimeter (s), which is (5 + 5 + 6)/2 = (16)/2 = 8. Then, the area would be sqrt[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)]. Plugging in the values: sqrt[8*(8-5)*(8-5)*(8-6)] = sqrt[8*3*3*2] = sqrt[8*9*2] = sqrt[144] = 12. Hmm, that worked out cleanly. So the area is 12 square units.

Answer: To find the area of a triangle with sides measuring 5, 5, and 6 units, we can use the fact that the triangle is isosceles. 

1. **Identify the base and height**: 
   - The base of the triangle is 6 units.
   - Splitting the isosceles triangle into two right-angled triangles by drawing a perpendicular from the apex to the midpoint of the base, we get two right triangles with hypotenuse 5 (the sides of the original triangle), base 3 (half of the original base), and height to be calculated.

2. **Calculate the height using the Pythagorean theorem**:
   - For each right-angled triangle: 
     \[
     5^2 = 3^2 + \text{height}^2
     \]
     \[
     25 = 9 + \text{height}^2
     \]
     \[
     \text{height}^2 = 16
     \]
     \[
     \text{height} = 4
     \]

3. **Calculate the area**:
   - Using the formula for the area of a triangle:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \times 4 = 12
     \]

4. **Verification using Heron's formula**:
   - Calculate the semi-perimeter \( s \):
     \[
     s = \frac{5 + 5 + 6}{2} = 8
     \]
   - Apply Heron's formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \sqrt{8 \times (8-5) \times (8-5) \times (8-6)} = \sqrt{8 \times 3 \times 3 \times 2} = \sqrt{144} = 12
     \]

Both methods confirm the area is 12 square units.

The final answer is \boxed{12}.

     \text{height}^2 = 16
     \]
     \[
     \text{height} = 4
     \]

3. **calculate the area**:
   - using the formula for the area of a triangle:
     \[
     \text{area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \times 4 = 12
     \]

4. **verification using heron's formula**:
   - calculate the semi-perimeter \( s \):
     \[
     s = \frac{5 + 5 + 6}{2} = 8
     \]
   - apply heron's formula:
     \[
     \text{area} = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \sqrt{8 \times (8-5) \times (8-5) \times (8-6)} = \sqrt{8 \times 3 \times 3 \times 2} = \sqrt{144} = 12
     \]

both methods confirm the area is 12 square units.

the final answer is \boxed{12}
