Okay, so I need to find the area of a triangle with sides measuring 5, 5, and 6 units. The problem says to find the number of square units in the area. Hmm, let me think.
First, I remember there are different formulas for the area of a triangle, like base times height divided by 2, or Heron's formula. Wait, Heron's formula only requires the lengths of the sides. Since I have all three sides given, maybe that's the way to go.
But then again, the triangle here has two sides equal (both 5 units) and one that's 6 units. So it's an isosceles triangle. Maybe there's a simpler way using the base and height.
Let me visualize the triangle. If I place the base as the side that's 6 units, then the other two sides (both 5 units) are symmetrical. In an isosceles triangle, the height from the base to the apex (the top vertex) splits the base into two equal parts and also splits the triangle into two right-angled triangles.
So maybe I can use that to find the height, and then use the area formula.
Let me try that approach first because it might be simpler than Heron's formula.

1: The area of the triangle can be determined using the formula (1/2) * base * height. Given that the triangle is isosceles with sides 5, 5, and 6, the base is set to 6 units. The height of the triangle can be found by considering the two right-angled triangles formed when the height is drawn from the apex to the midpoint of the base. Each of these right-angled triangles has a base of 3 units (half of the original base of 6 units) and a hypotenuse of 5 units (the length of the equal sides).

<Path>
1.1: The Pythagorean theorem is applied to find the height. The theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, the hypotenuse (5) squared equals the sum of the base of the right triangle (3) squared and the height squared. This relationship is expressed as 5^2 = 3^2 + height^2. The equation 25 = 9 + height^2 is then solved for height^2, yielding 16. The height is subsequently found to be the square root of 16, which is 4.

1.2: The area is calculated as (1/2) * base * height, which is (1/2) * 6 * 4, resulting in 3 * 4, or 12 square units.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 8*3*3*2. Let me compute that again. 8 multiplied by 3 is 24, 24 multiplied by 3 is 72, 72 multiplied by 2 is 144. So sqrt(144) is 12. So Heron's formula gives 12. But earlier, using the base and height, I got 12 as well. Wait, so both methods give the same answer. So maybe 12 is correct.

Wait, so both methods give 12. So that's consistent. So why was I confused before? Oh, maybe the initial problem statement mentioned "number of square units", so maybe they just want the numerical value. 12. Let me check again.
Alternatively, maybe the problem is trickier? Let me check. Wait, the sides are 5, 5, 6. So yes, isosceles triangle. When I split it into two right triangles, each has hypotenuse 5, and base 3. So the height is 4. That's a 3-4-5 triangle, which makes sense. So that part is correct. Then the area is 1/2 * 6 * 4 = 12. Alternatively, Heron's formula, same result. So, 12. So the answer is 12 square units. The problem says "number of square units in the area", so probably just the number, but maybe they want it as a box, like "the final answer is 12".
But let me check the problem again. It says "number of square units in the area of a triangle whose sides measure 5, 5 and 6 units?".
So yes, just find the area in square units, so the numerical value is 12. So the answer is 12. I need to write "the final answer is 12".
Wait, but sometimes they want it in a certain format. Let me check if the problem says "number of square units", so maybe they just need the number. So yes, the area is 12 square units, so the number is 12. So the final answer is 12. Okay.
**Final Answer**
\boxed{12}
</Think>

Answer: To find the area of a triangle with sides measuring 5, 5, and 6 units, we can use the method of base and height for an isosceles triangle.

1. **Identify the base and split the triangle**: Since the triangle is isosceles with sides 5, 5, and 6, we can consider the base as 6 units. Splitting the triangle from the apex to the midpoint of the base creates two right-angled triangles. Each right-angled triangle has a base of 3 units (half of 6) and a hypotenuse of 5 units.

2. **Calculate the height**: Using the Pythagorean theorem for one of the right-angled triangles:
   \[
   \text{height} = \sqrt{5^2 - 3^2} = \sqrt{25 - 9} = \sqrt{16} = 4
   \]

3. **Calculate the area**: Using the formula for the area of a triangle:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \times 4 = 12
   \]

We can verify this using Heron's formula:
1. **Calculate the semi-perimeter**:
   \[
   s = \frac{5 + 5 + 6}{2} = 8
   \]

2. **Apply Heron's formula**:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \sqrt{8 \times (8-5) \times (8-5) \times (8-6)} = \sqrt{8 \times 3 \times 3 \times 2} = \sqrt{144} = 12
   \]

Both methods confirm the area is 12 square units.

the final answer is \boxed{12}

2. **calculate the height**: using the pythagorean theorem for one of the right-angled triangles:
   \[
   \text{height} = \sqrt{5^2 - 3^2} = \sqrt{25 - 9} = \sqrt{16} = 4
   \]

3. **calculate the area**: using the formula for the area of a triangle:
   \[
   \text{area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \times 4 = 12
   \]

we can verify this using heron's formula:
1. **calculate the semi-perimeter**:
   \[
   s = \frac{5 + 5 + 6}{2} = 8
   \]

2. **apply heron's formula**:
   \[
   \text{area} = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \sqrt{8 \times (8-5) \times (8-5) \times (8-6)} = \sqrt{8 \times 3 \times 3 \times 2} = \sqrt{144} = 12
   \]

both methods confirm the area is 12 square units.

the final answer is \boxed{12}
