Okay, so I need to find the angle ABC using the given points A(1, -11, 2), B(3, -4, 1), and C(-2, 1, -1). The angle at B, right? So, how do I compute the angle between three points in 3D space? Hmm, in 2D, I might use the dot product, but does that work in 3D too? Wait, yeah, the dot product can be used regardless of the dimensions as long as the vectors are in the same dimension. Okay, so maybe I need to create vectors based at point B? So, to compute angle ABC, I need vectors BA and BC. Then, the angle between BA and BC is the angle at B. So first, let's compute vectors BA and BC.
To get vector BA, it's point A minus point B. Similarly, vector BC is point C minus point B. Wait, actually, no. Wait, if we have points B, A, and C, then vectors BA and BC would be the vectors from B to A and B to C. Wait, but angle ABC would be the angle at B between points A and C. So yes, vectors BA and BC.
Wait, but to get vector BA, it's A - B, right? Because vectors go from the first point to the second point. So BA is A - B. Similarly, BC is C - B. Wait, but in which direction are the vectors pointing? Wait, if we want vectors based at B, then BA is the vector from B to A, which is A - B, and BC is the vector from B to C, which is C - B.
So, let's confirm that. So vectors BA and BC.
Let's think in parallel.

2: Calculate the vector BC from points B(3,-4,1) and C(-2,1,-1).
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: Vector BA is calculated as A - B, which is (1-3, -11-(-4), 2-1), resulting in (-2, -7, 1).
</Path>
<Path>
2: Similarly, vector BC is C - B: (-2 - 3, 1 - (-4), -1 - 1) = (-5, 5, -2).
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The vector BA is (-2, -7, 1), and the vector BC is (-5, 5, -2).
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So vectors BA = (-2, -7, 1) and BC = (-5, 5, -2). Then, the angle at B is the angle between vectors BA and BC. To compute the angle between two vectors, we can use the dot product formula: cosθ = (BA ⋅ BC) / (|BA| |BC|). So first, compute the dot product of BA and BC, then divide by the product of their magnitudes, then take the arccos to get the angle. Then convert that to degrees. Let's think in parallel.

1: The dot product of vectors BA = (-2, -7, 1) and BC = (-5, 5, -2) is computed as (-2)*(-5) + (-7)*(5) + (1)*(-2), which simplifies to 10 - 35 - 2, resulting in -27.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The magnitude of vector BA, |BA|, is calculated as the square root of the sum of squares of its components: sqrt((-2)^2 + (-7)^2 + (1)^2), which simplifies to sqrt(4 + 49 + 1), resulting in sqrt(54), and further simplifies to 3√6.
</Path>
<Path>
3: The magnitude of vector BC, |BC|, is calculated as √((-5)^2 + 5^2 + (-2)^2), which equals √(25 + 25 + 4), simplifying to √54, or 3√6.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The dot product of BA and BC is -27, the magnitude of BA is 3√6, and the magnitude of BC is 3√6.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So |BA| is sqrt(54) which is 3√6, and |BC| is sqrt(54) which is 3√6. So multiplying them gives (3√6)(3√6) = 9 * 6 = 54. So cosθ = -27 / 54 = -0.5. Then, θ = arccos(-0.5). Arccos(-0.5) is 120 degrees, because cos(120°) is -0.5. So the angle is 120 degrees.

The dot product BA ⋅ BC is (-2)*(-5) + (-7)*5 + 1*(-2), which equals 10 - 35 - 2, confirming the value of -27. The magnitude |BA| is sqrt((-2)^2 + (-7)^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(4 + 49 + 1) = sqrt(54), or 3√6. Similarly, |BC| is sqrt((-5)^2 + 5^2 + (-2)^2) = sqrt(25 + 25 + 4) = sqrt(54), or 3√6. The product of these magnitudes, |BA||BC|, is (3√6)(3√6) = 9*6 = 54. The cosine of the angle θ is therefore -27/54 = -0.5, which corresponds to θ = 120 degrees.

Answer: To find the angle $\angle ABC$ between points $A(1, -11, 2)$, $B(3, -4, 1)$, and $C(-2, 1, -1)$, we first compute the vectors $\overrightarrow{BA}$ and $\overrightarrow{BC}$.

1. **Compute vectors $\overrightarrow{BA}$ and $\overrightarrow{BC}$:**
   - $\overrightarrow{BA} = A - B = (1 - 3, -11 - (-4), 2 - 1) = (-2, -7, 1)$
   - $\overrightarrow{BC} = C - B = (-2 - 3, 1 - (-4), -1 - 1) = (-5, 5, -2)$

2. **Compute the dot product $\overrightarrow{BA} \cdot \overrightarrow{BC}$:**
   \[
   \overrightarrow{BA} \cdot \overrightarrow{BC} = (-2)(-5) + (-7)(5) + (1)(-2) = 10 - 35 - 2 = -27
   \]

3. **Compute the magnitudes of $\overrightarrow{BA}$ and $\overrightarrow{BC}$:**
   - $|\overrightarrow{BA}| = \sqrt{(-2)^2 + (-7)^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{4 + 49 + 1} = \sqrt{54} = 3\sqrt{6}$
   - $|\overrightarrow{BC}| = \sqrt{(-5)^2 + 5^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{25 + 25 + 4} = \sqrt{54} = 3\sqrt{6}$

4. **Compute the cosine of the angle:**
   \[
   \cos \theta = \frac{\overrightarrow{BA} \cdot \overrightarrow{BC}}{|\overrightarrow{BA}| |\overrightarrow{BC}|} = \frac{-27}{(3\sqrt{6})(3\sqrt{6})} = \frac{-27}{54} = -0.5
   \]

5. **Find the angle $\theta$:**
   \[
   \theta = \arccos(-0.5) = 120^\circ
   \]

The final answer is $\boxed{120}$ degrees.

okay, so i need to find the angle abc using the given points a(1, -11, 2), b(3, -4, 1), and c(-2, 1, -1). the angle at b, right? so, how do i compute the angle between three points in 3d space? hmm, in 2d, i might use the dot product, but does that work in 3d too? wait, yeah, the dot product can be used regardless of the dimensions as long as the vectors are in the same dimension. okay, so maybe i need to create vectors based at point b? so, to compute angle abc, i need vectors ba and bc. then, the angle between ba and bc is the angle at b. so first, let's compute vectors ba and bc.
to get vector ba, it's point a minus point b. similarly, vector bc is point c minus point b. wait, actually, no. wait, if we have points b, a, and c, then vectors ba and bc would be the vectors from b to a and b to c. wait, but angle abc would be the angle at b between points a and c. so yes, vectors ba and bc.
wait, but to get vector ba, it's a - b, right? because vectors go from the first point to the second point. so ba is a - b. similarly, bc is c - b. wait, but in which direction are the vectors pointing? wait, if we want vectors based at b, then ba is the vector from b to a, which is a - b, and bc is the vector from b to c, which is c - b.
so, let's confirm that. so vectors ba and bc.

the dot product of ba and bc is -27, the magnitude of ba is 3√6, and the magnitude of bc is 3√6.

so |ba| is sqrt(54) which is 3√6, and |bc| is sqrt(54) which is 3√6. so multiplying them gives (3√6)(3√6) = 9 * 6 = 54. so cosθ = -27 / 54 = -0.5. then, θ = arccos(-0.5). arccos(-0.5) is 120 degrees, because cos(120°) is -0.5. so the angle is 120 degrees.

answer: to find the angle $\angle abc$ between points $a(1, -11, 2)$, $b(3, -4, 1)$, and $c(-2, 1, -1)$, we first compute the vectors $\overrightarrow{ba}$ and $\overrightarrow{bc}$.

1. **compute vectors $\overrightarrow{ba}$ and $\overrightarrow{bc}$:**
   - $\overrightarrow{ba} = a - b = (1 - 3, -11 - (-4), 2 - 1) = (-2, -7, 1)$
   - $\overrightarrow{bc} = c - b = (-2 - 3, 1 - (-4), -1 - 1) = (-5, 5, -2)$

2. **compute the dot product $\overrightarrow{ba} \cdot \overrightarrow{bc}$:**
   \[
   \overrightarrow{ba} \cdot \overrightarrow{bc} = (-2)(-5) + (-7)(5) + (1)(-2) = 10 - 35 - 2 = -27
   \]

3. **compute the magnitudes of $\overrightarrow{ba}$ and $\overrightarrow{bc}$:**
   - $|\overrightarrow{ba}| = \sqrt{(-2)^2 + (-7)^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{4 + 49 + 1} = \sqrt{54} = 3\sqrt{6}$
   - $|\overrightarrow{bc}| = \sqrt{(-5)^2 + 5^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{25 + 25 + 4} = \sqrt{54} = 3\sqrt{6}$

4. **compute the cosine of the angle:**
   \[
   \cos \theta = \frac{\overrightarrow{ba} \cdot \overrightarrow{bc}}{|\overrightarrow{ba}| |\overrightarrow{bc}|} = \frac{-27}{(3\sqrt{6})(3\sqrt{6})} = \frac{-27}{54} = -0.5
   \]

5. **find the angle $\theta$:**
   \[
   \theta = \arccos(-0.5) = 120^\circ
   \]

the final answer is $\boxed{120}$ degrees
