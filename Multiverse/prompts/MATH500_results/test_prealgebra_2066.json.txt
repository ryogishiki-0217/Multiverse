Okay, let me see. So Kathy has $300 in the bank, and she wants to withdraw half in British pounds and half in euros. The question is asking how many more euros than pounds she will have. They've given the exchange rates: 1 pound is 1.64 USD, and 1 euro is 1.32 USD. And we need to round to the nearest whole number.
First, I need to figure out how much money she's withdrawing in pounds and how much in euros.
Since she wants to withdraw half of her money in each, that means half of $300 is $150.
So she's converting $150 into pounds and $150 into euros.
But wait, actually, hold on.
Let's make sure.
She has $300, and she wants to withdraw half of it in pounds and half in euros.
So that would mean $150 each in different currencies, right?
But actually, no.
Wait, actually, she's withdrawing half of her total money in each currency.
Wait, she has $300 in the bank, but the bank is in US dollars, right?
So if she wants to withdraw half of it (which is $150) in pounds, and the other half ($150) in euros.
So she's converting $150 to pounds and $150 to euros.
So first, we need to convert $150 to pounds using the exchange rate, then convert $150 to euros using their exchange rate, then find the difference between the number of euros and pounds.
So let's start with converting $150 to pounds.
The exchange rate is 1 pound = 1.64 USD.
So to find out how many pounds she gets, we divide the dollar amount by the exchange rate.
So pounds = USD / exchange rate.
Therefore, pounds would be 150 / 1.64.
Similarly, euros are 150 / 1.32.
Then subtract the pounds from the euros to see the difference.
So let me compute that step by step.
First, calculate pounds: 150 divided by 1.64.
Let me compute that.
1.64 goes into 150 how many times?
Let me do this division.
150 divided by 1.64.
To make it easier, multiply numerator and denominator by 100 to eliminate the decimal: 150 * 100 = 15000, 1.64 * 100 = 164.
So 15000 divided by 164.
Let me compute that.
164 times 90 is 14,760.
Subtract that from 15,000: 15,000 - 14,760 = 240.
Then bring down a zero, make it 2400.
164 times 14 is 2,306.
Subtract that from 2400: 2400 - 2306 = 94.
Bring down a zero, making it 940.
164 times 5 is 820.
Subtract: 940 - 820 = 120.
Bring down a zero: 1200.
164 times 7 is 1,148.
Subtract: 1200 - 1148 = 52.
So the total is 90 +14+5+7 = 116.
But wait, let's see:
Wait, first division step: 164 into 15000.
As 164*90=14760, subtract that gives 240.
So 90.something.
Then 164 into 240 is 1 time (164), remainder 240 -164=76.
Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.
Let me start over.
150 / 1.64.
Convert to 15000 / 164.
Let's compute 15000 divided by 164.
Let me use decimal division.
1.64 | 150.0000
So 1.64 goes into 150 how many times?
Let me approximate.
1.64 * 90 = 147.6, which is less than 150.
Subtract 147.6 from 150: 2.4.
Then bring down a zero, making it 24.0.
1.64 goes into 24.0 how many times?
Let's see: 1.64 * 14 = 23.06.
So subtract 23.06 from 24.00: 0.94.
Then bring down a zero: 9.4.
1.64 goes into 9.4 how many times?
Let's see: 1.64 * 5 = 8.2.
Subtract: 9.4 - 8.2 = 1.2.
Bring down a zero: 12.0.
1.64 * 7 = 11.48.
Subtract: 12.0 - 11.48 = 0.52.
Bring down a zero: 5.2.
1.64 * 3 = 4.92.
Subtract: 5.2 - 4.92 = 0.28.
Bring down a zero: 2.8.
1.64 * 1 = 1.64.
Subtract: 2.8 - 1.64 = 1.16.
Bring down a zero: 11.6.
1.64 * 7 = 11.48.
Subtract: 0.12.
And so on.
So putting it all together:
90 +14 +0.05 (from 5*0.01?), but maybe tracking decimals is better.
Wait, the initial 90 was from the first division, then 14 for the next, so that's 90.14?
Wait, no.
Wait, 1.64 goes into 150.00 as 90 times (147.6), then 14 more times (23.06), so total is 90 +14 = 104, but we had 90*1.64 = 147.6, then 14*1.64=23.06, then 5*1.64=8.2, etc.
Wait, maybe this is getting too messy.
Let me use a calculator approach.
Alternatively, 150 divided by 1.64.
Let me compute 1.64 * 91.5 = 1.64 * 90 = 147.6 + 1.64 *1.5=2.46 → 147.6 +2.46=150.
So 150 /1.64=91.5.
Wait, is that right?
Because 1.64 times 90 is 147.6, 1.64 times 1.5 is 2.46; 147.6 +2.46=150.
Yes!
So 150 divided by 1.64 is exactly 91.5 pounds.
Okay, so that's the pounds.
Now, euros.
Similarly, convert $150 to euros at 1 euro =1.32 USD.
So euros = 150 /1.32.
Again, compute this.
150 divided by1.32.
Same approach.
Let me convert to fractions: 150 /1.32 =15000/132=1,250/11≈113.636...
Alternatively, 1.32 * 113 = 1.32*100 +1.32*10 +1.32*3 =132 +13.2 +3.96=149.16.
So 1.32*113=149.16, which is just under 150.
So 113 euros would cost $149.16, so the remaining amount is 150 -149.16=0.84 USD.
Then, 0.84 /1.32=0.64 radians?
Wait, no.
In terms of euros, so 0.84 USD is 0.84 /1.32≈0.636 euros.
So total euros would be 113 +0.636≈113.636 euros.
Alternatively, calculate 150 /1.32.
Let me do that.
1.32 into 150.
1.32 * 113 =149.16, as above.
So 1.32 * (113 +0.636)≈1.32*(113.636)= roughly 150.
So 113.636.
So approximately 113.636 euros.
So now, we have pounds as 91.5 and euros as approximately 113.636.
The question is how many more euros than pounds, so subtract pounds from euros.
So 113.636 -91.5= approx 22.136.
But since the problem says to round to the nearest whole number.
So 22.136 rounds to 22.
Wait, but 22.136 is closer to 22 than to 23.
Let me confirm the exact values first to make sure.
Wait, wait, let's check the exact values.
First, pounds: 150 /1.64=91.5 pounds.
Euros: 150 /1.32.
Let me compute 150 divided by 1.32 exactly.
1.32 × 113 =149.16.
As above.
150 -149.16=0.84.
0.84 /1.32=0.636363...
So 113 +0.636363...=113.636363..., which is approximately 113.636.
So subtract 113.636 -91.5=22.136, which is approximately 22.14.
So rounding to the nearest whole number: .14 is less than 0.5, so round down to 22.
But let's check if I did the conversion correctly.
Wait, euros = 150 /1.32.
Let me compute that with more precision.
1.32 into 150.000:
1.32 ×113=149.16.
Difference is 150.00 -149.16=0.84.
Bring down a 0: 8.4.
1.32 ×6=7.92.
Subtract: 8.4 -7.92=0.48.
Bring down a 0:4.8.
1.32×3=3.96.
Subtract:4.8 -3.96=0.84.
Again, bring down a 0:8.4.
This repeats.
So 150 /1.32=113.636363...
So it's a repeating decimal 113.636363...
So approximately 113.636.
Similarly, pounds is exactly 91.5.
So difference is 113.636363... -91.5=22.136363...
Which is approximately 22.14.
Since 0.136... is less than 0.5, so we round down to 22.
So the answer is 22.
Wait, but let me confirm once more.
Perhaps I should keep more decimal places when doing the subtraction.
Let's see:
Euros: approx 113.636363...
Pounds: 91.500000...
Subtracting:
113.636363...
-91.500000...
=22.136363...
So indeed, approximately 22.136.
So rounding to the nearest whole number is 22.
Therefore, the answer is 22.
But let me check once again if my initial approach was correct.
Wait, does she withdraw half of her money in each currency?
Or half of the total?
Wait, she withdraws half of her money (which is $150) in pounds and half in euros.
So the amount in pounds is 150/1.64=91.5, and euros is 150/1.32≈113.636.
The difference is 113.636 -91.5≈22.136, rounds to 22.
Another thing to check: maybe they expect you to convert the total money into both currencies?
Wait, but the problem says she withdraws half of it in pounds and half in euros.
So since she has $300, half is $150, so she's converting $150 to pounds and $150 to euros.
So my original approach is correct.
Alternatively, if the problem was structured differently, but given the problem statement, I think this is the correct way.
Alternatively, if the money is being withdrawn in pounds and euros, but perhaps the total amount withdrawn is in both currencies, but the problem says "she has 300 US dollars in the bank but wants to withdraw half of it in British pounds and half of it in euros".
So half of the 300 dollars is 150, so two withdrawals: 150 in pounds and 150 in euros.
So my initial calculation is correct.
So I think my answer is right.
But let me compute again:
150 /1.64=91.5
150 /1.32≈113.636
Difference:113.636 -91.5=22.136≈22.14, which rounds to 22.
Yes, so 22.
Alternatively, maybe exact fractions.
Let me compute exact values.
150 /1.64 -150 /1.32.
Let me compute that.
First, 150 /1.64=15000/164=7500/82≈91.463...
Wait, 82*91=7462, 7462 +82*0.463≈7462 +37.986≈7500.
Wait, actually, 7500/82=91.463...
Wait, but earlier, we had 150 /1.64=91.5.
Wait, that's because 1.64*91.5=150.
So exact.
Wait, 1.64*91.5=1.64*(90+1.5)=1.64*90 +1.64*1.5=147.6 +2.46=150.
So exact value is 91.5 pounds.
But for euros, 150 /1.32=15000/132=1250/11≈113.636...
So 113.636...
So difference is 113.636... -91.5=22.136...
So approximately 22.14, which is 22 when rounded to the nearest whole number.
Therefore, the answer is 22.
But let me check once again if the problem is asking for how many more euros than pounds, meaning euro amount minus pound amount.
Yes.
So the user has to make sure that the calculation is euro conversion minus pound conversion, which is 113.636 -91.5≈22.14≈22.
Alternatively, perhaps the question is in reverse?
No, the problem says "how many more euros than pounds will she have?"
So euros - pounds.
So correct.
Alternatively, maybe the problem is in the exchange rate.
Wait, the problem says "Assume 1 pound = 1.64 USD and 1 euro = 1.32 USD".
So these are the rates to convert pounds and euros to USD.
Therefore, to convert USD to pounds, you divide USD by 1.64, and to convert USD to euros, divide by 1.32.
So that's correct.
So yes, euros is 150 /1.32≈113.636, and pounds is 150 /1.64=91.5.
So difference is approximately 22.136, which rounds to 22.
So the final answer is 22.
**Final Answer**
\boxed{22}
</Think>

Answer: Kathy has $300 in the bank and wants to withdraw half in British pounds and half in euros. She needs to convert $150 into each currency. 

To determine how many pounds she will get:
\[
\text{Pounds} = \frac{150}{1.64} = 91.5
\]

To determine how many euros she will get:
\[
\text{Euros} = \frac{150}{1.32} \approx 113.636
\]

Calculating the difference between the number of euros and pounds:
\[
113.636 - 91.5 \approx 22.136
\]

Rounding 22.136 to the nearest whole number gives 22.

\[

<think>
okay, let me see. so kathy has $300 in the bank, and she wants to withdraw half in british pounds and half in euros. the question is asking how many more euros than pounds she will have. they've given the exchange rates: 1 pound is 1.64 usd, and 1 euro is 1.32 usd. and we need to round to the nearest whole number.
first, i need to figure out how much money she's withdrawing in pounds and how much in euros.
since she wants to withdraw half of her money in each, that means half of $300 is $150.
so she's converting $150 into pounds and $150 into euros.
but wait, actually, hold on.
let's make sure.
she has $300, and she wants to withdraw half of it in pounds and half in euros.
so that would mean $150 each in different currencies, right?
but actually, no.
wait, actually, she's withdrawing half of her total money in each currency.
wait, she has $300 in the bank, but the bank is in us dollars, right?
so if she wants to withdraw half of it (which is $150) in pounds, and the other half ($150) in euros.
so she's converting $150 to pounds and $150 to euros.
so first, we need to convert $150 to pounds using the exchange rate, then convert $150 to euros using their exchange rate, then find the difference between the number of euros and pounds.
so let's start with converting $150 to pounds.
the exchange rate is 1 pound = 1.64 usd.
so to find out how many pounds she gets, we divide the dollar amount by the exchange rate.
so pounds = usd / exchange rate.
therefore, pounds would be 150 / 1.64.
similarly, euros are 150 / 1.32.
then subtract the pounds from the euros to see the difference.
so let me compute that step by step.
first, calculate pounds: 150 divided by 1.64.
let me compute that.
1.64 goes into 150 how many times?
let me do this division.
150 divided by 1.64.
to make it easier, multiply numerator and denominator by 100 to eliminate the decimal: 150 * 100 = 15000, 1.64 * 100 = 164.
so 15000 divided by 164.
let me compute that.
164 times 90 is 14,760.
subtract that from 15,000: 15,000 - 14,760 = 240.
then bring down a zero, make it 2400.
164 times 14 is 2,306.
subtract that from 2400: 2400 - 2306 = 94.
bring down a zero, making it 940.
164 times 5 is 820.
subtract: 940 - 820 = 120.
bring down a zero: 1200.
164 times 7 is 1,148.
subtract: 1200 - 1148 = 52.
so the total is 90 +14+5+7 = 116.
but wait, let's see:
wait, first division step: 164 into 15000.
as 164*90=14760, subtract that gives 240.
so 90.something.
then 164 into 240 is 1 time (164), remainder 240 -164=76.
wait, maybe i made a mistake here.
let me start over.
150 / 1.64.
convert to 15000 / 164.
let's compute 15000 divided by 164.
let me use decimal division.
1.64 | 150.0000
so 1.64 goes into 150 how many times?
let me approximate.
1.64 * 90 = 147.6, which is less than 150.
subtract 147.6 from 150: 2.4.
then bring down a zero, making it 24.0.
1.64 goes into 24.0 how many times?
let's see: 1.64 * 14 = 23.06.
so subtract 23.06 from 24.00: 0.94.
then bring down a zero: 9.4.
1.64 goes into 9.4 how many times?
let's see: 1.64 * 5 = 8.2.
subtract: 9.4 - 8.2 = 1.2.
bring down a zero: 12.0.
1.64 * 7 = 11.48.
subtract: 12.0 - 11.48 = 0.52.
bring down a zero: 5.2.
1.64 * 3 = 4.92.
subtract: 5.2 - 4.92 = 0.28.
bring down a zero: 2.8.
1.64 * 1 = 1.64.
subtract: 2.8 - 1.64 = 1.16.
bring down a zero: 11.6.
1.64 * 7 = 11.48.
subtract: 0.12.
and so on.
so putting it all together:
90 +14 +0.05 (from 5*0.01?), but maybe tracking decimals is better.
wait, the initial 90 was from the first division, then 14 for the next, so that's 90.14?
wait, no.
wait, 1.64 goes into 150.00 as 90 times (147.6), then 14 more times (23.06), so total is 90 +14 = 104, but we had 90*1.64 = 147.6, then 14*1.64=23.06, then 5*1.64=8.2, etc.
wait, maybe this is getting too messy.
let me use a calculator approach.
alternatively, 150 divided by 1.64.
let me compute 1.64 * 91.5 = 1.64 * 90 = 147.6 + 1.64 *1.5=2.46 → 147.6 +2.46=150.
so 150 /1.64=91.5.
wait, is that right?
because 1.64 times 90 is 147.6, 1.64 times 1.5 is 2.46; 147.6 +2.46=150.
yes!
so 150 divided by 1.64 is exactly 91.5 pounds.
okay, so that's the pounds.
now, euros.
similarly, convert $150 to euros at 1 euro =1.32 usd.
so euros = 150 /1.32.
again, compute this.
150 divided by1.32.
same approach.
let me convert to fractions: 150 /1.32 =15000/132=1,250/11≈113.636...
alternatively, 1.32 * 113 = 1.32*100 +1.32*10 +1.32*3 =132 +13.2 +3.96=149.16.
so 1.32*113=149.16, which is just under 150.
so 113 euros would cost $149.16, so the remaining amount is 150 -149.16=0.84 usd.
then, 0.84 /1.32=0.64 radians?
wait, no.
in terms of euros, so 0.84 usd is 0.84 /1.32≈0.636 euros.
so total euros would be 113 +0.636≈113.636 euros.
alternatively, calculate 150 /1.32.
let me do that.
1.32 into 150.
1.32 * 113 =149.16, as above.
so 1.32 * (113 +0.636)≈1.32*(113.636)= roughly 150.
so 113.636.
so approximately 113.636 euros.
so now, we have pounds as 91.5 and euros as approximately 113.636.
the question is how many more euros than pounds, so subtract pounds from euros.
so 113.636 -91.5= approx 22.136.
but since the problem says to round to the nearest whole number.
so 22.136 rounds to 22.
wait, but 22.136 is closer to 22 than to 23.
let me confirm the exact values first to make sure.
wait, wait, let's check the exact values.
first, pounds: 150 /1.64=91.5 pounds.
euros: 150 /1.32.
let me compute 150 divided by 1.32 exactly.
1.32 × 113 =149.16.
as above.
150 -149.16=0.84.
0.84 /1.32=0.636363...
so 113 +0.636363...=113.636363..., which is approximately 113.636.
so subtract 113.636 -91.5=22.136, which is approximately 22.14.
so rounding to the nearest whole number: .14 is less than 0.5, so round down to 22.
but let's check if i did the conversion correctly.
wait, euros = 150 /1.32.
let me compute that with more precision.
1.32 into 150.000:
1.32 ×113=149.16.
difference is 150.00 -149.16=0.84.
bring down a 0: 8.4.
1.32 ×6=7.92.
subtract: 8.4 -7.92=0.48.
bring down a 0:4.8.
1.32×3=3.96.
subtract:4.8 -3.96=0.84.
again, bring down a 0:8.4.
this repeats.
so 150 /1.32=113.636363...
so it's a repeating decimal 113.636363...
so approximately 113.636.
similarly, pounds is exactly 91.5.
so difference is 113.636363... -91.5=22.136363...
which is approximately 22.14.
since 0.136... is less than 0.5, so we round down to 22.
so the answer is 22.
wait, but let me confirm once more.
perhaps i should keep more decimal places when doing the subtraction.
let's see:
euros: approx 113.636363...
pounds: 91.500000...
subtracting:
113.636363...
-91.500000...
=22.136363...
so indeed, approximately 22.136.
so rounding to the nearest whole number is 22.
therefore, the answer is 22.
but let me check once again if my initial approach was correct.
wait, does she withdraw half of her money in each currency?
or half of the total?
wait, she withdraws half of her money (which is $150) in pounds and half in euros.
so the amount in pounds is 150/1.64=91.5, and euros is 150/1.32≈113.636.
the difference is 113.636 -91.5≈22.136, rounds to 22.
another thing to check: maybe they expect you to convert the total money into both currencies?
wait, but the problem says she withdraws half of it in pounds and half in euros.
so since she has $300, half is $150, so she's converting $150 to pounds and $150 to euros.
so my original approach is correct.
alternatively, if the problem was structured differently, but given the problem statement, i think this is the correct way.
alternatively, if the money is being withdrawn in pounds and euros, but perhaps the total amount withdrawn is in both currencies, but the problem says "she has 300 us dollars in the bank but wants to withdraw half of it in british pounds and half of it in euros".
so half of the 300 dollars is 150, so two withdrawals: 150 in pounds and 150 in euros.
so my initial calculation is correct.
so i think my answer is right.
but let me compute again:
150 /1.64=91.5
150 /1.32≈113.636
difference:113.636 -91.5=22.136≈22.14, which rounds to 22.
yes, so 22.
alternatively, maybe exact fractions.
let me compute exact values.
150 /1.64 -150 /1.32.
let me compute that.
first, 150 /1.64=15000/164=7500/82≈91.463...
wait, 82*91=7462, 7462 +82*0.463≈7462 +37.986≈7500.
wait, actually, 7500/82=91.463...
wait, but earlier, we had 150 /1.64=91.5.
wait, that's because 1.64*91.5=150.
so exact.
wait, 1.64*91.5=1.64*(90+1.5)=1.64*90 +1.64*1.5=147.6 +2.46=150.
so exact value is 91.5 pounds.
but for euros, 150 /1.32=15000/132=1250/11≈113.636...
so 113.636...
so difference is 113.636... -91.5=22.136...
so approximately 22.14, which is 22 when rounded to the nearest whole number.
therefore, the answer is 22.
but let me check once again if the problem is asking for how many more euros than pounds, meaning euro amount minus pound amount.
yes.
so the user has to make sure that the calculation is euro conversion minus pound conversion, which is 113.636 -91.5≈22.14≈22.
alternatively, perhaps the question is in reverse?
no, the problem says "how many more euros than pounds will she have?"
so euros - pounds.
so correct.
alternatively, maybe the problem is in the exchange rate.
wait, the problem says "assume 1 pound = 1.64 usd and 1 euro = 1.32 usd".
so these are the rates to convert pounds and euros to usd.
therefore, to convert usd to pounds, you divide usd by 1.64, and to convert usd to euros, divide by 1.32.
so that's correct.
so yes, euros is 150 /1.32≈113.636, and pounds is 150 /1.64=91.5.
so difference is approximately 22.136, which rounds to 22.
so the final answer is 22.
**final answer**
\boxed{22}
</think>

answer: kathy has $300 in the bank and wants to withdraw half in british pounds and half in euros. she needs to convert $150 into each currency. 

to determine how many pounds she will get:
\[
\text{pounds} = \frac{150}{1.64} = 91.5
\]

to determine how many euros she will get:
\[
\text{euros} = \frac{150}{1.32} \approx 113.636
\]

calculating the difference between the number of euros and pounds:
\[
113.636 - 91.5 \approx 22.136
\]

rounding 22.136 to the nearest whole number gives 22.

\[
\boxed{22}
\]
