Okay, so the problem is asking me to add 313.9 to 12.6 and then express the result as a decimal. Hmm, adding decimals. That seems straightforward, but let me make sure I do it right. First, I remember that when adding decimals, it's important to line up the decimal points. Let me write them one above the other to visualize it better.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: The value of the first number, 313.9.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: The value of the second number, 12.6.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The first number is 313.9.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The second number is 12.6.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The first number is 313.9, and the second number is 12.6.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So, writing them with the decimal points aligned:
313.9
+ 12.6
----------
Now, let me add them starting from the rightmost digits. First, the tenths place: 9 tenths plus 6 tenths equals 15 tenths. So, 1.5. Let me write down the 5 in the tenths place and carry over the 1 to the units place.
Moving to the units place: 3 plus 2 is 5, plus the carry-over makes 6. So, 6 in the units place.
Then, moving left to the tens place: 1 plus 1 is 2. So, 2 in the tens place.
Then, the hundreds place: 3, since there's nothing to add in the hundreds place from the second number. So, 3 in the hundreds place.
Putting it all together, we have 3 (hundreds) 2 (tens) 6 (units) . 5 (tenths). So, 326.5. Let me verify that again. 313.9 has three hundred, twelve and nine tenths. Adding twelve and six tenths. So three hundred plus twelve is three hundred twenty-six. Nine tenths plus six tenths is fifteen tenths, which is one and a half, so the one carries over to make three hundred twenty-six, and point five. Yep, so 326.5.
Just to double-check, let me do it another way. Let's ignore the decimals first. If I add 3139 tenths and 126 tenths. 313.9 is 3139 tenths, and 12.6 is 126 tenths. Adding them: 3139 + 126 = 3265 tenths. Then, converting back to decimal, 3265 tenths is 326.5. Yep, same result.
Alternatively, if I use the place value method, it also comes to 326.5. So, I think that's correct. The problem says to express the result as a decimal, which 326.5 already is. So, no need for further conversion.
the final answer is 326.5

Answer: To solve the problem of adding 313.9 to 12.6 and expressing the result as a decimal, we follow these steps:

1. Align the numbers by their decimal points:
   ```
   313.9
   +12.6
   ```

2. Add the numbers starting from the rightmost digits:
   - Tenths place: \(9 + 6 = 15\) (write down 5, carry over 1)
   - Units place: \(3 + 2 = 5\), plus the carry-over 1 makes 6
   - Tens place: \(1 + 1 = 2\)
   - Hundreds place: \(3\)

3. Combining these results gives us \(326.5\).

Verification by converting to tenths:
- \(313.9\) is \(3139\) tenths.
- \(12.6\) is \(126\) tenths.
- Adding these gives \(3139 + 126 = 3265\) tenths, which converts to \(326.5\) in decimal form.

Thus, the final answer is \boxed{326.5}.
