Okay, so I need to add 313.9 and 12.6 together and express the result as a decimal. That seems straightforward, but let me walk through it step by step to make sure I don't make any mistakes.
First, let me line up the numbers by their decimal points and add them.
Since 313.9 is a three-digit number with a tenth place, and 12.6 is a two-digit number also with a tenth place, I should align the decimal points and then add each column.
Let me write them one above the other:
```
  313.9
+  12.6
--------
```
Now, starting from the rightmost digit, which is the tenths place.
9 tenths plus 6 tenths is 15 tenths.
15 tenths is equal to 1.5, so I write down 5 in the tenths place and carry over 1 to the units column.
Moving to the units column.
3 units plus 2 units is 5, plus the carry-over makes 6 units.
So I write down 6.
Next, the tens column.
1 ten plus 1 ten is 2 tens.
So I write down 2.
Then the hundreds column.
3 hundreds plus 0 hundreds (since 12.6 doesn't have a hundreds place) is 3 hundreds.
So I write down 3.
Putting it all together, the sum should be 326.5.
Let me verify that again.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: The sum of the tenths place digits (9 + 6) and the resulting carryover.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: The sum of the units place digits (3 + 2) and the subsequent carryover addition.
</Outline>
<Outline>
3: The sum of the tens place digits (1 + 1).
</Outline>
<Outline>
4: The sum of the hundreds place digits (3 + 0).
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The digits in the tenths place are 9 and 6. Their sum, 15 tenths, is equivalent to 1.5, resulting in a tenths place value of 5 and a carryover of 1 to the units column.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The units column sum is 5, to which the carryover of 1 is added, resulting in 6.
</Path>
<Path>
3: The digits in the tens place, 1 and 1, are added, resulting in 2.
</Path>
<Path>
4: The hundreds place digits, 3 and 0, sum to 3.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The sum of the tenths place (9+6) is 15 tenths (1.5), yielding a tenths place value of 5 and a carryover of 1. The sum of the units place (3+2) plus the carryover is 6. The sum of the tens place (1+1) is 2, and the sum of the hundreds place (3+0) is 3.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So 313.9 + 12.6 = 326.5.
Alternatively, to check, I can think of it as adding the whole numbers and the decimals separately.
The whole numbers are 313 and 12, which add up to 325.
The decimals are 0.9 and 0.6, which add up to 1.5.
Then, 325 + 1.5 = 326.5.
Yes, that's the same result.
Another way to check: maybe do 300 + 12.6 = 312.6, and then add the remaining 13.9.
Wait, 312.6 + 13.9: 312.6 + 10 is 322.6, then +3.9 is 326.5.
Same result.
Yep, so that confirms it's 326.5.
So as a final answer, it would be 326.5.
The problem says to express the result as a decimal, which 326.5 already is, so no need for further conversion.
Just to make sure, in case if one number was a fraction or a different form, but both are decimals, so adding them directly as decimals is correct.
the final answer is 326.5

Answer: To solve the problem of adding 313.9 and 12.6, we align the numbers by their decimal points and add each column step by step:

```
  313.9
+  12.6
--------
```

1. **Tenths place**: Adding 9 tenths and 6 tenths gives 15 tenths (1.5). We write down 5 in the tenths place and carry over 1 to the units column.
2. **Units place**: Adding 3 units and 2 units gives 5 units, plus the carried-over 1 makes 6 units.
3. **Tens place**: Adding 1 ten and 1 ten gives 2 tens.
4. **Hundreds place**: Adding 3 hundreds and 0 hundreds (since 12.6 has no hundreds place) gives 3 hundreds.

Putting it all together, the sum is 326.5. 

To verify, we can add the whole numbers (313 + 12 = 325) and the decimals (0.9 + 0.6 = 1.5) separately, then combine them (325 + 1.5 = 326.5). This confirms the result.

The final answer is \boxed{326.5}.
