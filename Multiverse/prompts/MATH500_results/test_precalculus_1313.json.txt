Okay, let's see here. I need to solve for x in the equation: tan 53° tan x° = tan 53° + tan x° + tan x°. Wait, hold on, actually, the original equation is tan 53° tan 81° tan x° equals tan 53° + tan 81° + tan x°. So, we have three tangent terms multiplied together on the left, and all three tangent terms added together on the right. The equation is: tan 53 tan 81 tan x = tan 53 + tan 81 + tan x. And they want to find x where 0 < x < 180, but x is in degrees, so need to convert to radians if necessary later. Hmm, okay.
First, maybe I can recall some trigonometric identities that might help here.

Let me think. If tan A + tan B + tan C = tan A tan B tan C, then that resembles the expansion of the tangent addition formula for three angles. Wait, in trigonometry, when you have multiple angles added, like tan(A + B + C) = (tan A + tan B + tan C - tan A tan B tan C) / (1 - (tan A tan B + tan B tan C + tan C tan A)). So, if A + B + C = 90 degrees, maybe? Wait, but here, the equation is tan A tan B tan C = tan A + tan B + tan C. So, setting that equal. Let's see. Suppose that if A + B + C = 90°, then maybe some relation. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps if we divide both sides by tan A tan B tan C, then the equation becomes 1 = (1/tan A) + (1/tan B) + (1/tan C). But 1/tan is cotangent. So, 1 = cot A + cot B + cot C. Hmm, but I don't know if that helps. Wait, let's rearrange the original equation. Bring all terms to one side: tan 53 tan 81 tan x - tan 53 - tan 81 - tan x = 0. Hmm, that seems more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps factor stuff. Let's see. Let me denote tan 53 as a, tan 81 as b, tan x as c. Then the equation becomes: a b c = a + b + c. So, a b c - a - b - c = 0. Hmm. Maybe factor that. Let's see. Let's rearrange: a b c - a - b - c = 0. Let me factor term by term. For instance, group terms with a: a(b c - 1) - (b + c) = 0. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps adding 1 then subtracting 1: a b c - a - b - c +1 -1 = -1. So, (a b c +1) - (a + b + c +1) = -1 -1? Hmm, not helpful. Alternatively, maybe think of the equation as (ab - 1/c) = (a + b + c)/c. Wait, but maybe this is getting too convoluted. Let me try plugging in actual values for tan 53 and tan 81. Maybe compute their numerical values and see if pattern emerges. So, tan 53°: 53 degrees is approximately 1.327, but exact? Hmm, 53 degrees is close to 53.13 degrees which is π/6 radians, but not exactly. Wait, tan(53.13°) is approximately √3, which is about 1.732. But 53 degrees is less than that. Wait, actual value: 53 degrees in radians is 53π/180 ≈ 0.925 radians. Then tan(0.925) ≈ 1.327. Similarly, tan 81 degrees: 81 degrees is close to 90 degrees, so it's going to be a large value. Let me check: tan(81 degrees) ≈ tan(81π/180 radians) ≈ tan(1.4137 radians) ≈ 6.3138. So, tan 53 ≈ 1.327, tan 81 ≈ 6.3138. So, the equation would be 1.327 * 6.3138 * tan x ≈ 1.327 + 6.3138 + tan x. Compute left side: Let's see, 1.327 * 6.3138 ≈ 1.327 *6 = 7.962, 1.327*0.3138≈0.417; total≈8.379. So left side is ≈8.379 * tan x. Right side is≈1.327 +6.3138 + tan x≈7.6408 + tan x. So, 8.379 tan x ≈7.6408 + tan x. Bring all terms to left:8.379 tan x - tan x ≈7.6408⇒7.379 tan x ≈7.6408⇒tan x≈7.6408/7.379≈1.035. So tan x≈1.035, so x≈46 degrees. Wait, but tan 45°=1, so 46° would be slightly more than 1. However, let me check tan 46°: 46 degrees is approximately 1.0355, so yes, that's about right. So x≈46°, so is 46° the answer? But wait, let's check with exact values. Wait, but maybe the answer is 47 degrees? Hmm, but the approximate calculation gives around 46. But maybe there's an exact answer using trigonometric identities. Let me go back. Let's think in parallel.

Suppose that A = 53°, B = 81°, C = x°. Then if tan A tan B tan C = tan A + tan B + tan C. Hmm. Wait, in triangle-related problems, if A + B + C = 180°, then tan A + tan B + tan C = tan A tan B tan C if A + B + C = 180°. But here, we have three angles: 53°, 81°, and x°, such that their tangents multiplied equals their sum. So similar to the triangle identity. So maybe 53 + 81 + x = 180°? Let's check: 53 +81=134, 180 -134=46. So x=46°. Wait, that's straightforward. So if 53°, 81°, and x° are angles in a triangle, then their sum must be 180°, so x=180-53-81=46°. And in any triangle, the identity tan A + tan B + tan C = tan A tan B tan C holds. So if we set x=46°, then 53° +81° +46°=180°, so they form a triangle, and hence the equation holds. Therefore, x=46°. Therefore, the answer is 46 degrees. Wait, that seems plausible. Let me verify. Suppose A=53°, B=81°, C=46°. Then A + B + C =180°, so the identity tan A + tan B + tan C = tan A tan B tan C should hold. Therefore, if I compute tan 53 + tan 81 + tan 46, it should equal tan 53 * tan 81 * tan 46. Let me check with approximate values. tan 53 ≈1.327, tan 81≈6.3138, tan 46≈1.0355. Sum:1.327 +6.3138 +1.0355≈8.6763. Product:1.327 *6.3138≈1.327*6=7.962, 1.327*0.3138≈0.417, total≈8.379. Then 8.379 *1.0355≈8.379*1=8.379, 8.379*0.0355≈0.297, total≈8.676. So indeed, approximately equal. So the equation holds. Therefore, x=46°.

Answer: The given equation is \(\tan 53^\circ \tan 81^\circ \tan x^\circ = \tan 53^\circ + \tan 81^\circ + \tan x^\circ\). 

We use the trigonometric identity that for angles \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) in a triangle (where \(A + B + C = 180^\circ\)), the identity \(\tan A + \tan B + \tan C = \tan A \tan B \tan C\) holds. 

Given \(A = 53^\circ\) and \(B = 81^\circ\), we need to find \(C = x^\circ\) such that \(53^\circ + 81^\circ + x^\circ = 180^\circ\). Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = 180^\circ - 53^\circ - 81^\circ = 46^\circ
\]

Verification using approximate values confirms the identity holds true for \(x = 46^\circ\). Therefore, the solution is:

\(\boxed{46}\)

The final answer is \(\boxed{46}\).

answer: the given equation is \(\tan 53^\circ \tan 81^\circ \tan x^\circ = \tan 53^\circ + \tan 81^\circ + \tan x^\circ\). 

we use the trigonometric identity that for angles \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in a triangle (where \(a + b + c = 180^\circ\)), the identity \(\tan a + \tan b + \tan c = \tan a \tan b \tan c\) holds. 

given \(a = 53^\circ\) and \(b = 81^\circ\), we need to find \(c = x^\circ\) such that \(53^\circ + 81^\circ + x^\circ = 180^\circ\). solving for \(x\):

\[
x = 180^\circ - 53^\circ - 81^\circ = 46^\circ
\]

verification using approximate values confirms the identity holds true for \(x = 46^\circ\). therefore, the solution is:

\(\boxed{46}\)

the final answer is \(\boxed{46}\)
