Okay, let me try to figure out this problem.
So, we have a polynomial f(x), and the equation given is (x - 1) multiplied by f(x) equals 3x^4 + x^3 - 25x^2 + 38x - 17.
They’re asking for the degree of f(x).
First, I remember that when you multiply two polynomials, the degree of the product is usually the sum of the degrees of the individual polynomials.
Let me verify that.
For example, if I have (x + 2)(x^2 + 3x + 4), the result is a cubic polynomial, degree 3, which is the sum of degrees 1 and 2.
So yes, in general, if you multiply a polynomial of degree m by a polynomial of degree n, you get a polynomial of degree m + n, right?
Unless some terms cancel out.
But in this case, since we’re given the product explicitly, and there’s no indication that the leading terms cancel, I can assume that the degree of the product is just the sum of the degrees.
So here, (x - 1) is a first-degree polynomial.
So if f(x) is a polynomial of degree n, then the left-hand side, (x - 1) * f(x), should be a polynomial of degree n + 1.
On the right-hand side, we have 3x^4 + x^3 -25x^2 +38x -17, which is a 4th-degree polynomial.
Therefore, equating the degrees: n + 1 = 4.
Therefore, n must be 3.
So the degree of f(x) is 3.
Wait, is that it?
That seems straightforward.
Let me see if there’s a twist.
Could the leading terms cancel out somehow?
Let’s think.
The leading term on the right-hand side is 3x^4.
If (x - 1) and f(x) have leading coefficients such that when multiplied, they produce 3x^4.
Let’s denote f(x) as a polynomial with leading term a*x^n.
Then, multiplying by (x - 1), the leading term becomes a*x^{n+1}.
On the right-hand side, the leading term is 3x^4.
Therefore, n+1 must be 4, so n=3, and the leading coefficient a (of f(x)) times 1 (the coefficient of x in (x -1)) must be 3.
So a = 3.
Therefore, f(x) must be a third-degree polynomial with leading coefficient 3.
So even if lower degree terms cancel, the leading term must match, so the degree is determined by the highest degree term.
Since polynomial multiplication is exact, and unless we’re working modulo something, the degree behavior is predictable.
Therefore, without any more complications, the degree of f(x) is 3.
Alternatively, maybe they want me to perform polynomial division?
Like dividing the right-hand side by (x - 1) to get f(x).
Then, the degree would be whatever the resulting polynomial’s degree is.
Would that be different?
Let me check.
If I do polynomial long division of 3x^4 +x^3 -25x^2 +38x -17 by (x - 1), the result should be a polynomial of degree 4 - 1 = 3.
So that would also confirm the degree.
Wait, perhaps the problem is testing whether I know that division step.
But since they say (x -1) is a factor, then the result of dividing by (x -1) would give a polynomial of degree one less.
But since here, (x -1) * f(x) = given polynomial (degree 4), so f(x) must be degree 3.
Alternatively, if I perform the division, let me just try that to confirm.
Let’s do polynomial long division of 3x^4 + x^3 -25x^2 +38x -17 by (x - 1).
First, divide 3x^4 by x, gets 3x^3.
Multiply by (x - 1): 3x^4 - 3x^3.
Subtract that from the original polynomial:
(3x^4 + x^3 -25x^2 +38x -17) - (3x^4 -3x^3) = 4x^3 -25x^2 +38x -17.
Bring down the next term.
Now divide 4x^3 by x, get 4x^2.
Multiply by (x -1): 4x^3 -4x^2.
Subtract from the current polynomial:
(4x^3 -25x^2 +38x -17) - (4x^3 -4x^2) = -21x^2 +38x -17.
Next, divide -21x^2 by x, get -21x.
Multiply by (x -1): -21x^2 +21x.
Subtract:
(-21x^2 +38x -17) - (-21x^2 +21x) = 17x -17.
Now divide 17x by x, get 17.
Multiply by (x -1): 17x -17.
Subtract:
(17x -17) - (17x -17) = 0.
So the division gives us 3x^3 +4x^2 -21x +17 with no remainder.
Therefore, f(x) = 3x^3 +4x^2 -21x +17, which indeed is a third-degree polynomial.
Therefore, the degree is 3.
So both approaches confirm that the degree is 3.
So the answer is 3.
But just to make sure, let me think again.
Because sometimes when you multiply, even if one of the factors is higher degree, but terms might cancel.
Wait, but in this case, (x -1) is degree 1, f(x) is degree n, so product is degree n+1.
Since here, n+1 =4, so n=3.
Alternatively, if the product is 4th degree, and (x -1) is 1st degree, so the other polynomial has to be 4th - 1 = 3rd degree.
Another way: the number of roots of a polynomial (counting multiplicity) is equal to its degree.
If f(x) is multiplied by (x -1), then the roots of (x -1)f(x) are the roots of (x -1) and the roots of f(x).
Therefore, the number of roots of (x -1)f(x) is 1 + number of roots of f(x).
Therefore, if (x -1)f(x) is degree 4, then it has 4 roots.
Therefore, f(x) must have 3 roots, hence degree 3.
All right, so all these methods confirm that the degree is 3.
Therefore, the answer is 3.
**Final Answer**
\boxed{3}
the final answer is \boxed{3}

subtract that from the original polynomial:
(3x^4 + x^3 -25x^2 +38x -17) - (3x^4 -3x^3) = 4x^3 -25x^2 +38x -17.
bring down the next term.
now divide 4x^3 by x, get 4x^2.
multiply by (x -1): 4x^3 -4x^2.
subtract from the current polynomial:
(4x^3 -25x^2 +38x -17) - (4x^3 -4x^2) = -21x^2 +38x -17.
next, divide -21x^2 by x, get -21x.
multiply by (x -1): -21x^2 +21x.
subtract:
(-21x^2 +38x -17) - (-21x^2 +21x) = 17x -17.
now divide 17x by x, get 17.
multiply by (x -1): 17x -17.
subtract:
(17x -17) - (17x -17) = 0.
so the division gives us 3x^3 +4x^2 -21x +17 with no remainder.
therefore, f(x) = 3x^3 +4x^2 -21x +17, which indeed is a third-degree polynomial.
therefore, the degree is 3.

therefore, f(x) must have 3 roots, hence degree 3.
