Okay, let's see. The problem says that there's a polynomial f, and when you multiply it by (x - 1), you get 3x^4 + x^3 - 25x^2 + 38x - 17. They want to know the degree of f. Hmm, okay.

1: First, I remember that when you multiply two polynomials, the degree of the product is usually the sum of the degrees of the individual polynomials. Unless, of course, there's some cancellation, but since we're multiplying by (x - 1), which is degree 1, the degree of the product should be one more than the degree of f. Because (x - 1) is degree 1, and if f is degree n, then the product would be degree n + 1.

2: The given equation is (x - 1) multiplied by f(x), which equals the polynomial 3x^4 + x^3 - 25x^2 + 38x - 17. The polynomial (x - 1) is of degree 1, and the right-hand side (RHS) polynomial is of degree 4.

The degree of the product of two polynomials is typically the sum of their individual degrees. The given equation involves multiplying a degree 1 polynomial (x-1) by an unknown polynomial f(x) to produce a degree 4 polynomial.

1: The degree of the product is 4, and since (x - 1) is degree 1, the degree of f(x) is calculated as 4 minus 1, resulting in 3.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The leading term of f(x) is 3x^3. Multiplying this by (x - 1) yields 3x^4 - 3x^3. The leading term of this product is 3x^4, which matches the leading term of the given polynomial 3x^4 + x^3 - 25x^2 + 38x - 17. The term -3x^3 also appears in this multiplication.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The standard degree multiplication rule suggests that f(x) is a degree 3 polynomial. This result is supported by an examination of the leading terms, as the product of 3x^3 (from f(x)) and (x-1) produces the correct leading term 3x^4 for the given polynomial.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
But wait, does the coefficient matter here? The leading term of the product is 3x^4, which would result from multiplying the leading term of f(x) by x (from the (x - 1) term). So, if f(x) is degree 3, its leading term is, say, ax^3. When multiplied by x, that gives ax^4, and then the -1 multiplied by the leading term of f(x) would be -ax^3. So the product's leading term is indeed ax^4, and the next term is (-a)x^3. But the given polynomial's leading terms are 3x^4 and x^3. So that means a = 3, and then -a should be equal to the coefficient of x^3, which is 1. Wait, but if a = 3, then the coefficient of x^3 would be -3. But in the given polynomial, it's x^3, so coefficient 1. That's inconsistent.
Wait, that's a problem. That suggests that maybe our initial assumption is wrong? But how? Let me check again. Suppose f(x) is a third-degree polynomial, f(x) = 3x^3 + bx^2 + cx + d. Then, when we multiply by (x - 1), we get:
(x - 1)(3x^3 + bx^2 + cx + d) = x*(3x^3 + bx^2 + cx + d) - 1*(3x^3 + bx^2 + cx + d) = 3x^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx - 3x^3 - bx^2 - cx - d = 3x^4 + (b - 3)x^3 + (c - b)x^2 + (d - c)x - d.
Now, according to the problem, this is equal to 3x^4 + x^3 -25x^2 +38x -17. So, corresponding coefficients should be equal. So:

The comparison of coefficients from the expanded product (x-1)f(x) to the given polynomial 3x^4 + x^3 - 25x^2 + 38x - 17 results in the system of equations: b - 3 = 1, c - b = -25, d - c = 38, and -d = -17.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So solving these equations:
From the last equation: -d = -17 => d = 17.
Then d - c =38: 17 - c =38 => -c =38 -17=21 => c = -21.
c - b = -25: -21 - b = -25 => -b = -25 +21= -4 => b =4.
b -3 =1: 4 -3=1. That checks out.
So then f(x) =3x^3 +4x^2 -21x +17.

The multiplication -1 * f(x) yields -1*(3x^3 +4x^2 -21x +17) = -3x^3 -4x^2 +21x -17. The sum of these two results, 3x^4 +4x^3 -21x^2 +17x -3x^3 -4x^2 +21x -17, is then simplified. The x^4 term is 3x^4. The x^3 terms (4x^3 - 3x^3) combine to x^3. The x^2 terms (-21x^2 - 4x^2) combine to -25x^2. The x terms (17x + 21x) combine to 38x. The constant term is -17.

Therefore, the original polynomial f(x) is indeed a third-degree polynomial. So the answer is 3. Wait, but hold on, the problem says "Solve the following math problem: [the equation]". But originally, the problem might have been to find the degree of f(x). Wait, actually, looking back, the original problem statement here is: "Solve the following math problem: Solve the following math problem: [equation]". Wait, actually, the user provided: "Solve the following math problem: Solve (x-1)f(x) =3x^4 +x^3 -25x^2 +38x -17" But the instruction is: "Solve the following math problem..." followed by the equation. So the user wants to solve the equation for f(x). But in this context, "solve" might mean "find f(x)", in which case we did that: f(x) = (3x^4 + x^3 -25x^2 +38x -17)/(x -1). But through polynomial division or synthetic division. However, in the previous reasoning, since multiplying (x -1) with f(x) gives a 4th-degree polynomial, f(x) must be of degree 3. So the answer is 3. Wait, but the problem never says "find the degree of f(x)". It just says to solve the problem, which is to solve for f(x). But in the original question, perhaps the user meant to ask for the degree of f(x). Wait, given the way the problem is phrased here, the user wrote: "Solve the following math problem: Solve (x-1)f(x)=3x^4+x^3-25x^2+38x-17" So "solve" the equation, which involves finding f(x). But solving for f(x) would require dividing the given polynomial by (x -1). So to solve for f(x), perform polynomial division. Alternatively, use the method of undetermined coefficients as I did above. Which gives f(x) =3x^3 +4x^2 -21x +17. Therefore, the solution is f(x) =3x^3 +4x^2 -21x +17. But perhaps the question is from a student who wants to know the degree of f(x), but in the original problem, it's phrased as solving for f(x). However, in the initial exchange here, the user's instruction is "solve the following math problem", which is the equation provided. Therefore, the proper answer would be to solve for f(x) by dividing the polynomial by (x -1), which results in f(x)=3x^3 +4x^2 -21x +17. Therefore, the answer is that polynomial. But if the question was about the degree of f(x), then the answer is 3. Wait, perhaps there's confusion. Let me check the exact problem statement. The problem is exactly: "Solve (x-1)f(x) =3x^4 +x^3 -25x^2 +38x -17" So solving for f(x) means dividing the polynomial on the RHS by (x -1). So f(x) = (3x^4 +x^3 -25x^2 +38x -17)/(x -1). To perform this division, we can use long division or synthetic division. Alternatively, as previously, by equating coefficients as in the method above. Since we already did that and found f(x) =3x^3 +4x^2 -21x +17, which is a third-degree polynomial, then that's the solution. Therefore, the answer is that polynomial. But the problem says "solve the following math problem: solve (x-1)f(x)..." So the problem is an equation, and solving it would require expressing f(x) as the polynomial, which is the solution. Therefore, the answer is the polynomial f(x) =3x^3 +4x^2 -21x +17. However, looking back at the instructions, the user asked to "solve the following math problem", which is the equation given. So the solution to the problem is the polynomial f(x), which was found by either expanding as above. Therefore, the solution is to present f(x). But in the prior reasoning, when we did the multiplication, we found f(x) is 3rd degree. Therefore, if the question is "solve for f(x)", then the answer is the polynomial f(x) =3x^3 +4x^2 -21x +17. But if the question is "what is the degree of f(x)?", then the answer is 3. But the given problem is "Solve (x-1)f(x) =3x^4 +x^3 -25x^2 +38x -17". Therefore, "solve" here likely means to find f(x), so the answer is the polynomial. However, perhaps the original problem was to find the degree of f(x), but given how the user phrased it here, they might have meant to transcribe "find f(x)", but in their original problem, maybe it's about the degree. However, given the information given here, the problem is to solve for f(x), so the answer is the polynomial. However, in the initial reasoning, before finding the coefficients, I considered the degree, which is 3. But since the problem is to solve for f(x), the answer is the polynomial expression. But in the original problem statement provided by the user here, perhaps they intended to ask for the degree, but due to potential translation or transcription error, it's phrased as "solve". Alternatively, maybe the problem is from a perspective where "solving" the equation refers to finding the degree. But given the equation (x -1)f(x) = given 4th degree polynomial, then f(x) must be of degree 3, so in that sense, the answer is 3. But if we treat this as an equation to solve for f(x), then f(x) is as we found. However, the problem statement is ambiguous. But given the user's instruction to "solve the following math problem" presented, which is an equation to solve for f(x), the answer is the polynomial. However, in the context of a math problem, often such an exercise is used to find the degree of f(x), especially if presented in a context where polynomial division is the method. But in the absence of further information, and given that the equation involves solving for f(x), so the answer is the polynomial. But in the prior analysis, when we equate coefficients, we found the coefficients of f(x) explicitly, so the answer is the polynomial. But then, why is there a confusion with the degree. Alternatively, perhaps in the original problem, there was a division by (x -1), and the student is supposed to notice that the given polynomial is divisible by (x -1), hence f(x) is the quotient, which would be a 3rd degree polynomial, so the answer is 3. But if that's the case, then applying the polynomial division, if we do synthetic division or check if 1 is a root of the given polynomial. Let's check if x =1 is a root of the RHS polynomial. Plugging x=1 into the RHS: 3(1)^4 +1^3 -25(1)^2 +38(1) -17 = 3 +1 -25 +38 -17 = (3+1) + (-25-17) +38 = 4 -42 +38 = 0. So yes, x=1 is a root, so (x -1) is a factor. Therefore, the given polynomial can be divided by (x -1) without remainder, and f(x) is exactly the quotient, which is a 3rd-degree polynomial. Therefore, through synthetic division, we can find f(x). So doing synthetic division: Coefficients of the RHS polynomial: 3, 1, -25, 38, -17. Dividing by x=1 (since synthetic division uses the root, so for (x -1), the root is 1). Using synthetic division: 1 | 3 | 1 | -25 | 38 | -17 --------------- 3 | 4 | -21 | 17 | 0 The division process: Bring down 3. 3*1 =3, add to next coefficient 1: gives 4. 4*1=4, add to -25: gives -21. -21*1=-21, add to 38: 17. 17*1=17, add to -17: 0. So the quotient coefficients are 3, 4, -21, 17, and the remainder is 0. So f(x) =3x^3 +4x^2 -21x +17. So the final answer is that polynomial. But the problem says "solve (x-1)f(x) = ...", so solving for f(x) requires dividing by (x -1). Therefore, the answer is f(x) =3x^3 +4x^2 -21x +17. But in the original problem statement presented by the user here, it's necessary to check again: The user wrote: "Solve the following math problem: Solve (x-1)f(x)=3x^4 +x^3 -25x^2 +38x -17" So, the user is asking to solve the equation for f(x). So the answer is f(x)= (3x^4 +x^3 -25x^2 +38x -17)/(x -1), which simplifies to the polynomial found via division. Therefore, f(x)=3x^3 +4x^2 -21x +17. Therefore, the answer is that polynomial. However, in the context of a problem where students might be asked about the degree of f(x), given that (x-1)f(x) is degree 4, so f(x) must be degree 3. But given that the original problem is written as "Solve (x-1)f(x) = ...", solving for f(x) requires division, and the result is the polynomial. So unless the question specifically asks for the degree, the answer is the polynomial. But in the initial reasoning, the degree was found to be 3, but the explicit question is to solve for f(x). Therefore, the answer should be the polynomial. However, looking back at the original problem statement again: The user wrote: "Solve the following math problem: Solve (x-1)f(x) =3x^4 +x^3 -25x^2 +38x -17" Wait, the user put two "Solve" statements. Probably, the first "Solve" is part of the platform's instruction, and the second "Solve (x-1)f(x)..." is the actual problem. So the actual problem is to solve (for f(x)) the equation (x-1)f(x) =3x^4 +x^3 -25x^2 +38x -17. So, in this case, solving the equation would mean isolating f(x) by dividing both sides by (x -1). Therefore, f(x) = (3x^4 +x^3 -25x^2 +38x -17)/(x -1). Since the right-hand side is a polynomial divisible by (x -1) (as established by synthetic division), then f(x) is equal to the quotient polynomial, which we found as 3x^3 +4x^2 -21x +17. Therefore, the solution is f(x)=3x^3 +4x^2 -21x +17. Therefore, the final answer is that polynomial.
**Final Answer** 
\boxed{3x^3 + 4x^2 - 21x + 17}
</Think>

Answer: To solve the equation \((x - 1)f(x) = 3x^4 + x^3 - 25x^2 + 38x - 17\) for \(f(x)\), we need to divide the polynomial on the right-hand side by \((x - 1)\).

1. **Check if \(x = 1\) is a root of the polynomial**:
   \[
   3(1)^4 + 1^3 - 25(1)^2 + 38(1) - 17 = 3 + 1 - 25 + 38 - 17 = 0
   \]
   Since \(x = 1\) is a root, \((x - 1)\) is a factor.

2. **Perform synthetic division**:
   Using the coefficients of the polynomial \(3, 1, -25, 38, -17\) and the root \(1\):
   \[
   \begin{array}{r|rrrrr}
     1 & 3 & 1 & -25 & 38 & -17 \\
       &   & 3 & 4 & -21 & 17 \\
     \hline
       & 3 & 4 & -21 & 17 & 0 \\
   \end{array}
   \]
   The quotient is \(3x^3 + 4x^2 - 21x + 17\) with a remainder of 0.

3. **Conclusion**:
   The polynomial \(3x^4 + x^3 - 25x^2 + 38x - 17\) divided by \((x - 1)\) gives the quotient \(3x^3 + 4x^2 - 21x + 17\). Therefore, \(f(x) = 3x^3 + 4x^2 - 21x + 17\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{3x^3 + 4x^2 - 21x + 17}\).

the standard degree multiplication rule suggests that f(x) is a degree 3 polynomial. this result is supported by an examination of the leading terms, as the product of 3x^3 (from f(x)) and (x-1) produces the correct leading term 3x^4 for the given polynomial.

but wait, does the coefficient matter here? the leading term of the product is 3x^4, which would result from multiplying the leading term of f(x) by x (from the (x - 1) term). so, if f(x) is degree 3, its leading term is, say, ax^3. when multiplied by x, that gives ax^4, and then the -1 multiplied by the leading term of f(x) would be -ax^3. so the product's leading term is indeed ax^4, and the next term is (-a)x^3. but the given polynomial's leading terms are 3x^4 and x^3. so that means a = 3, and then -a should be equal to the coefficient of x^3, which is 1. wait, but if a = 3, then the coefficient of x^3 would be -3. but in the given polynomial, it's x^3, so coefficient 1. that's inconsistent.
wait, that's a problem. that suggests that maybe our initial assumption is wrong? but how? let me check again. suppose f(x) is a third-degree polynomial, f(x) = 3x^3 + bx^2 + cx + d. then, when we multiply by (x - 1), we get:
(x - 1)(3x^3 + bx^2 + cx + d) = x*(3x^3 + bx^2 + cx + d) - 1*(3x^3 + bx^2 + cx + d) = 3x^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx - 3x^3 - bx^2 - cx - d = 3x^4 + (b - 3)x^3 + (c - b)x^2 + (d - c)x - d.
now, according to the problem, this is equal to 3x^4 + x^3 -25x^2 +38x -17. so, corresponding coefficients should be equal. so:

so solving these equations:
from the last equation: -d = -17 => d = 17.
then d - c =38: 17 - c =38 => -c =38 -17=21 => c = -21.
c - b = -25: -21 - b = -25 => -b = -25 +21= -4 => b =4.
b -3 =1: 4 -3=1. that checks out.

therefore, the original polynomial f(x) is indeed a third-degree polynomial. so the answer is 3. wait, but hold on, the problem says "solve the following math problem: [the equation]". but originally, the problem might have been to find the degree of f(x). wait, actually, looking back, the original problem statement here is: "solve the following math problem: solve the following math problem: [equation]". wait, actually, the user provided: "solve the following math problem: solve (x-1)f(x) =3x^4 +x^3 -25x^2 +38x -17" but the instruction is: "solve the following math problem..." followed by the equation. so the user wants to solve the equation for f(x). but in this context, "solve" might mean "find f(x)", in which case we did that: f(x) = (3x^4 + x^3 -25x^2 +38x -17)/(x -1). but through polynomial division or synthetic division. however, in the previous reasoning, since multiplying (x -1) with f(x) gives a 4th-degree polynomial, f(x) must be of degree 3. so the answer is 3. wait, but the problem never says "find the degree of f(x)". it just says to solve the problem, which is to solve for f(x). but in the original question, perhaps the user meant to ask for the degree of f(x). wait, given the way the problem is phrased here, the user wrote: "solve the following math problem: solve (x-1)f(x)=3x^4+x^3-25x^2+38x-17" so "solve" the equation, which involves finding f(x). but solving for f(x) would require dividing the given polynomial by (x -1). so to solve for f(x), perform polynomial division. alternatively, use the method of undetermined coefficients as i did above. which gives f(x) =3x^3 +4x^2 -21x +17. therefore, the solution is f(x) =3x^3 +4x^2 -21x +17. but perhaps the question is from a student who wants to know the degree of f(x), but in the original problem, it's phrased as solving for f(x). however, in the initial exchange here, the user's instruction is "solve the following math problem", which is the equation provided. therefore, the proper answer would be to solve for f(x) by dividing the polynomial by (x -1), which results in f(x)=3x^3 +4x^2 -21x +17. therefore, the answer is that polynomial. but if the question was about the degree of f(x), then the answer is 3. wait, perhaps there's confusion. let me check the exact problem statement. the problem is exactly: "solve (x-1)f(x) =3x^4 +x^3 -25x^2 +38x -17" so solving for f(x) means dividing the polynomial on the rhs by (x -1). so f(x) = (3x^4 +x^3 -25x^2 +38x -17)/(x -1). to perform this division, we can use long division or synthetic division. alternatively, as previously, by equating coefficients as in the method above. since we already did that and found f(x) =3x^3 +4x^2 -21x +17, which is a third-degree polynomial, then that's the solution. therefore, the answer is that polynomial. but the problem says "solve the following math problem: solve (x-1)f(x)..." so the problem is an equation, and solving it would require expressing f(x) as the polynomial, which is the solution. therefore, the answer is the polynomial f(x) =3x^3 +4x^2 -21x +17. however, looking back at the instructions, the user asked to "solve the following math problem", which is the equation given. so the solution to the problem is the polynomial f(x), which was found by either expanding as above. therefore, the solution is to present f(x). but in the prior reasoning, when we did the multiplication, we found f(x) is 3rd degree. therefore, if the question is "solve for f(x)", then the answer is the polynomial f(x) =3x^3 +4x^2 -21x +17. but if the question is "what is the degree of f(x)?", then the answer is 3. but the given problem is "solve (x-1)f(x) =3x^4 +x^3 -25x^2 +38x -17". therefore, "solve" here likely means to find f(x), so the answer is the polynomial. however, perhaps the original problem was to find the degree of f(x), but given how the user phrased it here, they might have meant to transcribe "find f(x)", but in their original problem, maybe it's about the degree. however, given the information given here, the problem is to solve for f(x), so the answer is the polynomial. however, in the initial reasoning, before finding the coefficients, i considered the degree, which is 3. but since the problem is to solve for f(x), the answer is the polynomial expression. but in the original problem statement provided by the user here, perhaps they intended to ask for the degree, but due to potential translation or transcription error, it's phrased as "solve". alternatively, maybe the problem is from a perspective where "solving" the equation refers to finding the degree. but given the equation (x -1)f(x) = given 4th degree polynomial, then f(x) must be of degree 3, so in that sense, the answer is 3. but if we treat this as an equation to solve for f(x), then f(x) is as we found. however, the problem statement is ambiguous. but given the user's instruction to "solve the following math problem" presented, which is an equation to solve for f(x), the answer is the polynomial. however, in the context of a math problem, often such an exercise is used to find the degree of f(x), especially if presented in a context where polynomial division is the method. but in the absence of further information, and given that the equation involves solving for f(x), so the answer is the polynomial. but in the prior analysis, when we equate coefficients, we found the coefficients of f(x) explicitly, so the answer is the polynomial. but then, why is there a confusion with the degree. alternatively, perhaps in the original problem, there was a division by (x -1), and the student is supposed to notice that the given polynomial is divisible by (x -1), hence f(x) is the quotient, which would be a 3rd degree polynomial, so the answer is 3. but if that's the case, then applying the polynomial division, if we do synthetic division or check if 1 is a root of the given polynomial. let's check if x =1 is a root of the rhs polynomial. plugging x=1 into the rhs: 3(1)^4 +1^3 -25(1)^2 +38(1) -17 = 3 +1 -25 +38 -17 = (3+1) + (-25-17) +38 = 4 -42 +38 = 0. so yes, x=1 is a root, so (x -1) is a factor. therefore, the given polynomial can be divided by (x -1) without remainder, and f(x) is exactly the quotient, which is a 3rd-degree polynomial. therefore, through synthetic division, we can find f(x). so doing synthetic division: coefficients of the rhs polynomial: 3, 1, -25, 38, -17. dividing by x=1 (since synthetic division uses the root, so for (x -1), the root is 1). using synthetic division: 1 | 3 | 1 | -25 | 38 | -17 --------------- 3 | 4 | -21 | 17 | 0 the division process: bring down 3. 3*1 =3, add to next coefficient 1: gives 4. 4*1=4, add to -25: gives -21. -21*1=-21, add to 38: 17. 17*1=17, add to -17: 0. so the quotient coefficients are 3, 4, -21, 17, and the remainder is 0. so f(x) =3x^3 +4x^2 -21x +17. so the final answer is that polynomial. but the problem says "solve (x-1)f(x) = ...", so solving for f(x) requires dividing by (x -1). therefore, the answer is f(x) =3x^3 +4x^2 -21x +17. but in the original problem statement presented by the user here, it's necessary to check again: the user wrote: "solve the following math problem: solve (x-1)f(x)=3x^4 +x^3 -25x^2 +38x -17" so, the user is asking to solve the equation for f(x). so the answer is f(x)= (3x^4 +x^3 -25x^2 +38x -17)/(x -1), which simplifies to the polynomial found via division. therefore, f(x)=3x^3 +4x^2 -21x +17. therefore, the answer is that polynomial. however, in the context of a problem where students might be asked about the degree of f(x), given that (x-1)f(x) is degree 4, so f(x) must be degree 3. but given that the original problem is written as "solve (x-1)f(x) = ...", solving for f(x) requires division, and the result is the polynomial. so unless the question specifically asks for the degree, the answer is the polynomial. but in the initial reasoning, the degree was found to be 3, but the explicit question is to solve for f(x). therefore, the answer should be the polynomial. however, looking back at the original problem statement again: the user wrote: "solve the following math problem: solve (x-1)f(x) =3x^4 +x^3 -25x^2 +38x -17" wait, the user put two "solve" statements. probably, the first "solve" is part of the platform's instruction, and the second "solve (x-1)f(x)..." is the actual problem. so the actual problem is to solve (for f(x)) the equation (x-1)f(x) =3x^4 +x^3 -25x^2 +38x -17. so, in this case, solving the equation would mean isolating f(x) by dividing both sides by (x -1). therefore, f(x) = (3x^4 +x^3 -25x^2 +38x -17)/(x -1). since the right-hand side is a polynomial divisible by (x -1) (as established by synthetic division), then f(x) is equal to the quotient polynomial, which we found as 3x^3 +4x^2 -21x +17. therefore, the solution is f(x)=3x^3 +4x^2 -21x +17. therefore, the final answer is that polynomial.
**final answer** 
\boxed{3x^3 + 4x^2 - 21x + 17}
</think>

answer: to solve the equation \((x - 1)f(x) = 3x^4 + x^3 - 25x^2 + 38x - 17\) for \(f(x)\), we need to divide the polynomial on the right-hand side by \((x - 1)\).

1. **check if \(x = 1\) is a root of the polynomial**:
   \[
   3(1)^4 + 1^3 - 25(1)^2 + 38(1) - 17 = 3 + 1 - 25 + 38 - 17 = 0
   \]
   since \(x = 1\) is a root, \((x - 1)\) is a factor.

2. **perform synthetic division**:
   using the coefficients of the polynomial \(3, 1, -25, 38, -17\) and the root \(1\):
   \[
   \begin{array}{r|rrrrr}
     1 & 3 & 1 & -25 & 38 & -17 \\
       &   & 3 & 4 & -21 & 17 \\
     \hline
       & 3 & 4 & -21 & 17 & 0 \\
   \end{array}
   \]
   the quotient is \(3x^3 + 4x^2 - 21x + 17\) with a remainder of 0.

3. **conclusion**:
   the polynomial \(3x^4 + x^3 - 25x^2 + 38x - 17\) divided by \((x - 1)\) gives the quotient \(3x^3 + 4x^2 - 21x + 17\). therefore, \(f(x) = 3x^3 + 4x^2 - 21x + 17\).

the final answer is \(\boxed{3x^3 + 4x^2 - 21x + 17}\)
