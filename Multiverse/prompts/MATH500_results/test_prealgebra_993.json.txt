Solve the following math problem: In 1992, a scoop of gelato could be purchased in Italy for 1200 lire. The same gelato would have cost $\$1.50$ in the U.S. At the equivalent exchange rate between the lire and the dollar, how many dollars would be equivalent to 1,000,000 lire?

Okay, let's see. The problem is about converting lire to dollars using an exchange rate from 1992. It says that in 1992, a scoop of gelato cost 1200 lire in Italy and $1.50 in the U.S. We need to find out how many dollars would be equivalent to 1,000,000 lire at that exchange rate.
First, I need to figure out the exchange rate between lire and dollars based on the gelato prices. If 1200 lire is equivalent to $1.50, then we can set up a proportion to find out how many dollars one lire is worth, and then use that to convert 1,000,000 lire.
Let me write down the known values:
Cost of gelato in Italy (lire): 1200 lire
Cost of gelato in U.S. (dollars): $1.50
Amount to convert (lire): 1,000,000 lire
We need to find the equivalent dollars for 1,000,000 lire.
So the exchange rate can be calculated as dollars per lire, which would be $1.50 divided by 1200 lire. That would give the dollar value of one lire. Then, multiplying that rate by 1,000,000 lire will give the equivalent in dollars.
Alternatively, we could set up a proportion: 1200 lire is to $1.50 as 1,000,000 lire is to x dollars. Then solve for x.
Either way, the steps are similar. Let me proceed step by step.
First, calculate the exchange rate (dollars per lire):
Exchange rate = $1.50 / 1200 lire
Let me compute that division.
1.50 divided by 1200.
Let's see, 1.50 divided by 1200.
First, divide 1.50 by 1200.
Maybe it's easier to think of it as (1.5 / 12) / 100.
Wait, 1200 is 12 * 100.
So 1.5 divided by 12 is 0.125, and then dividing by 100 gives 0.00125.
So the exchange rate is $0.00125 per lire.
That seems right because 1200 lire * $0.00125/lira = $1.50.
Let me check: 1200 * 0.00125.
0.00125 * 1000 = 1.25, and 1200 - 1000 = 200.
Wait, perhaps that's not straightforward. Alternatively, 1200 * 0.00125 is 1200 * (1.25 / 1000) = (1200 / 1000) * 1.25 = 1.2 * 1.25 = 1.50. Yes, that's correct.
So the exchange rate is $0.00125 per lira.
Therefore, to convert 1,000,000 lire to dollars, multiply 1,000,000 by 0.00125.
1,000,000 * 0.00125.
Let's compute that.
1,000,000 is 10^6.
0.00125 is 1.25 * 10^{-3}.
Wait, actually 0.00125 is 1250 / 1,000,000.
Wait, 0.00125 equals 1250 ten-thousandths?
Maybe another way: 0.00125 equals 1.25 divided by 1000, so 1,000,000 * 1.25 / 1000.
Simplify that: 1,000,000 divided by 1000 is 1000, multiplied by 1.25 gives 1250.
So 1,000,000 lire * 0.00125 $/lira = $1250.
Alternatively, using the proportion method:
Set up the proportion:
1200 lire / $1.50 = 1,000,000 lire / x dollars.
Cross-multiplying: 1200 * x = 1.50 * 1,000,000
Solve for x: x = (1.50 * 1,000,000) / 1200
Compute that:
First, 1.50 * 1,000,000 is 1,500,000.
Then divide by 1200.
So 1,500,000 / 1200.
Simplify numerator and denominator by dividing both by 100: 1,500,000 / 100 = 15,000 and 1200 / 100 = 12.
So 15,000 / 12.
Let's divide 15,000 by 12: 12 * 1250 = 15,000.
Since 12 * 1000 = 12,000
12 * 250 = 3,000
12,000 + 3,000 = 15,000
So 15,000 / 12 = 1250.
Therefore, x = 1250 dollars.
So both methods give the same result.
Therefore, 1,000,000 lire is equivalent to $1250 at that exchange rate.
Wait, just to make sure, let's think in terms of how much 1 lira is in dollars.
If 1200 lire = $1.50, then 1 lira = $1.50 / 1200 = $0.00125.
Then 1,000,000 lire * $0.00125/lira = $1,250,000 / 1000 = Wait, no, 1,000,000 * 0.00125 is 1,000,000 * 1.25e-3 = 1.25e3 = 1,250.
Yes, that's correct.
Alternatively, 1,000,000 lire is 1000 times more than 1200 lire.
So since 1200 lire is $1.50, multiplying both sides by 1000/1200 * 1,000,000 /1200, no.
Wait, perhaps another way: how many groups of 1200 lire are in 1,000,000 lire?
1,000,000 / 1200 = 833.333...
So there are 833.333... times 1200 lire in 1,000,000 lire.
Each of those times costs $1.50, so 833.333... * $1.50.
Let's compute that: 833.333... * 1.5.
Well, 800 * 1.5 = 1200, and 33.333... * 1.5 = 50, since 33.333... is 1/3, so 1/3 * 1.5 = 0.5.
So 1200 + 50 = 1250.
So same result.
Therefore, $1250 is correct.
Therefore, the answer should be 1250 dollars.
the final answer is 1250

Answer: To solve the problem of converting 1,000,000 lire to dollars using the equivalent exchange rate from 1992, we start by determining the exchange rate based on the given gelato prices. 

In 1992, a scoop of gelato cost 1200 lire in Italy and $1.50 in the U.S. We set up a proportion to find the exchange rate:

\[
\text{Exchange rate} = \frac{\$1.50}{1200 \text{ lire}} = \$0.00125 \text{ per lira}
\]

Next, we use this exchange rate to convert 1,000,000 lire to dollars:

\[
1,000,000 \text{ lire} \times 0.00125 \, \text{\$/lira} = \$1250
\]

We verify this by checking the proportion:

\[
\frac{1200 \text{ lire}}{\$1.50} = \frac{1,000,000 \text{ lire}}{x \text{ dollars}}
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{1.50 \times 1,000,000}{1200} = \$1250
\]

Both methods confirm the result. Therefore, the number of dollars equivalent to 1,000,000 lire is:

\[
\boxed{1250}
\]

we need to find the equivalent dollars for 1,000,000 lire.
so the exchange rate can be calculated as dollars per lire, which would be $1.50 divided by 1200 lire. that would give the dollar value of one lire. then, multiplying that rate by 1,000,000 lire will give the equivalent in dollars.
alternatively, we could set up a proportion: 1200 lire is to $1.50 as 1,000,000 lire is to x dollars. then solve for x.

first, divide 1.50 by 1200.
maybe it's easier to think of it as (1.5 / 12) / 100.
wait, 1200 is 12 * 100.
so 1.5 divided by 12 is 0.125, and then dividing by 100 gives 0.00125.
so the exchange rate is $0.00125 per lire.
that seems right because 1200 lire * $0.00125/lira = $1.50.
let me check: 1200 * 0.00125.
0.00125 * 1000 = 1.25, and 1200 - 1000 = 200.
wait, perhaps that's not straightforward. alternatively, 1200 * 0.00125 is 1200 * (1.25 / 1000) = (1200 / 1000) * 1.25 = 1.2 * 1.25 = 1.50. yes, that's correct.
so the exchange rate is $0.00125 per lira.
therefore, to convert 1,000,000 lire to dollars, multiply 1,000,000 by 0.00125.
1,000,000 * 0.00125.
let's compute that.
1,000,000 is 10^6.
0.00125 is 1.25 * 10^{-3}.
wait, actually 0.00125 is 1250 / 1,000,000.
wait, 0.00125 equals 1250 ten-thousandths?
maybe another way: 0.00125 equals 1.25 divided by 1000, so 1,000,000 * 1.25 / 1000.
simplify that: 1,000,000 divided by 1000 is 1000, multiplied by 1.25 gives 1250.
so 1,000,000 lire * 0.00125 $/lira = $1250.
alternatively, using the proportion method:
set up the proportion:
1200 lire / $1.50 = 1,000,000 lire / x dollars.
cross-multiplying: 1200 * x = 1.50 * 1,000,000
solve for x: x = (1.50 * 1,000,000) / 1200
compute that:
first, 1.50 * 1,000,000 is 1,500,000.
then divide by 1200.
so 1,500,000 / 1200.
simplify numerator and denominator by dividing both by 100: 1,500,000 / 100 = 15,000 and 1200 / 100 = 12.
so 15,000 / 12.
let's divide 15,000 by 12: 12 * 1250 = 15,000.
since 12 * 1000 = 12,000
12 * 250 = 3,000
12,000 + 3,000 = 15,000
so 15,000 / 12 = 1250.
therefore, x = 1250 dollars.
so both methods give the same result.
therefore, 1,000,000 lire is equivalent to $1250 at that exchange rate.
wait, just to make sure, let's think in terms of how much 1 lira is in dollars.
if 1200 lire = $1.50, then 1 lira = $1.50 / 1200 = $0.00125.

yes, that's correct.
alternatively, 1,000,000 lire is 1000 times more than 1200 lire.
so since 1200 lire is $1.50, multiplying both sides by 1000/1200 * 1,000,000 /1200, no.
wait, perhaps another way: how many groups of 1200 lire are in 1,000,000 lire?
1,000,000 / 1200 = 833.333...
so there are 833.333... times 1200 lire in 1,000,000 lire.
each of those times costs $1.50, so 833.333... * $1.50.
let's compute that: 833.333... * 1.5.
well, 800 * 1.5 = 1200, and 33.333... * 1.5 = 50, since 33.333... is 1/3, so 1/3 * 1.5 = 0.5.
so 1200 + 50 = 1250.
so same result.
therefore, $1250 is correct.
therefore, the answer should be 1250 dollars.
the final answer is 1250
