Solve the following math problem: In 1992, a scoop of gelato could be purchased in Italy for 1200 lire. The same gelato would have cost $\$1.50$ in the U.S. At the equivalent exchange rate between the lire and the dollar, how many dollars would be equivalent to 1,000,000 lire?

Okay, let's see here. The problem is about converting lire to dollars using an exchange rate from 1992. Hmm, so in that year, a scoop of gelato cost 1200 lire in Italy and $1.50 in the U.S. We need to find out how many dollars would be equivalent to 1,000,000 lire based on the same exchange rate. Alright, first things first, exchange rates. Exchange rates between two currencies are typically based on the relative value of one currency compared to the other. So, if I know how much one unit of currency A is in currency B, I can use that ratio to convert other amounts. In this case, the example given is the cost of a gelato. The idea is that the same item should cost the same in different countries when adjusted for exchange rates. This is kind of the purchasing power parity concept. So, the cost of the gelato in lire and dollars should give us the exchange rate between lire and dollars at that time. Let me write down the numbers given: - Cost of gelato in Italy (lire): 1200 lire - Cost of gelato in U.S. (dollars): $1.50 So, 1200 lire = $1.50. That's the key equivalence here. From this, we can find how many lire per dollar, or how many dollars per lire. Then, we can use that rate to convert 1,000,000 lire to dollars. Let's think in parallel.

1: The exchange rate of 1200 lire per $1.50 is used to find the number of lire per dollar. Dividing both sides of the equation by $1.50 yields 1200 / 1.50 = 800 lire per dollar. This means 800 lire are equivalent to one dollar. Consequently, 1,000,000 lire would be equivalent to 1,000,000 / 800 dollars. The division 1,000,000 / 800 can be simplified by recognizing that 800 is 8 * 100, leading to 1,000,000 / (8 * 100) = (1,000,000 / 100) / 8 = 10,000 / 8 = 1,250. Therefore, 1,000,000 lire would be equivalent to $1,250.

2: The quantity of dollars equivalent to one lira is calculated by dividing the dollar amount ($1.50) by the corresponding number of lire (1200 lire). This calculation yields a rate of $1.50 / 1200 lire, which simplifies to $0.00125 per lira.

<Conclusion>
The conversion rate derived from the gelato purchase price is 800 lire per dollar, which is equivalent to $0.00125 per lira.

Wait, so that's 1250 dollars. Hmm, but let's check if that makes sense. Alternatively, we can set up a proportion. If 1200 lire = $1.50, then 1,000,000 lire = X dollars. Solving for X, we can cross-multiply: 1200 / 1.50 = 1,000,000 / X X = (1,000,000 * 1.50) / 1200 Calculate that: First, simplify 1,000,000 / 1200. 1,000,000 divided by 1200 is the same as 1,000 / 1.2, because 1,000,000 divided by 1000 is 1000, and 1200 divided by 1000 is 1.2. Wait, actually, 1,000,000 divided by 1200 is equal to (1,000,000 / 1000) / (1200 / 1000) = 1000 / 1.2. Which is 1000 divided by 1.2. 1000 divided by 1.2 is the same as 1000 * (10/12) = 1000 * 5/6 = 5000/6 ≈ 833.333... So, 1,000,000 / 1200 = 833.333..., so X = 833.333... * 1.50 Multiply 833.333... by 1.5: 833.333... * 1 = 833.333... 833.333... * 0.5 = 416.666... Adding those together gives 833.333... + 416.666... = 1250. Exactly. So that confirms it. So the answer is $1250. Wait, but this contradicts my earlier result? Wait, hold on. When I did the first method, converting the rate to lire per dollar, I got 800 lire per dollar, so 1,000,000 / 800 = 1250. Then when I set up the proportion, I did 1200 / 1.50 = 1,000,000 / X, solved for X and got 1250. So both methods give the same result. So why was there confusion? There wasn't actually a contradiction; both methods confirm the same answer. So the answer is $1250. Wait, but maybe I need to check the calculation again because intuitively, if 1200 lire = $1.50, then 1,000,000 lire should be how many dollars? If 1200L = $1.50, then to find how many dollars in 1L, we do 1.50 / 1200 ≈ 0.00125 dollars per lira. Then multiply by 1,000,000 lira: 0.00125 * 1,000,000 = 1250. Yep. Alternatively, 1200 lire → $1.50, so per 1,000,000 lire, how many 1200 lire units are there? 1,000,000 / 1200 = 833.333..., then multiply by $1.50 gives 833.333... * 1.5 = 1250. Same result. So all methods lead to $1250. Therefore, the final answer is 1250.

Answer: Given that a scoop of gelato cost 1200 lire in Italy and $1.50 in the U.S. in 1992, we can determine the exchange rate between lire and dollars. 

First, we set up the equivalence:
\[ 1200 \text{ lire} = 1.50 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the exchange rate in terms of dollars per lire, we solve for the dollar value of 1 lire:
\[ 1 \text{ lira} = \frac{1.50}{1200} \text{ dollars} = 0.00125 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we use this exchange rate to convert 1,000,000 lire to dollars:
\[ 1,000,000 \text{ lire} \times 0.00125 \text{ dollars/lira} = 1250 \text{ dollars} \]

We can also verify this by setting up a proportion:
\[ \frac{1200 \text{ lire}}{1.50 \text{ dollars}} = \frac{1,000,000 \text{ lire}}{x \text{ dollars}} \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{1,000,000 \times 1.50}{1200} = \frac{1,500,000}{1200} = 1250 \]

Both methods confirm the same result. Therefore, the number of dollars equivalent to 1,000,000 lire is:
\[ \boxed{1250} \]

the final answer is 1250

wait, so that's 1250 dollars. hmm, but let's check if that makes sense. alternatively, we can set up a proportion. if 1200 lire = $1.50, then 1,000,000 lire = x dollars. solving for x, we can cross-multiply: 1200 / 1.50 = 1,000,000 / x x = (1,000,000 * 1.50) / 1200 calculate that: first, simplify 1,000,000 / 1200. 1,000,000 divided by 1200 is the same as 1,000 / 1.2, because 1,000,000 divided by 1000 is 1000, and 1200 divided by 1000 is 1.2. wait, actually, 1,000,000 divided by 1200 is equal to (1,000,000 / 1000) / (1200 / 1000) = 1000 / 1.2. which is 1000 divided by 1.2. 1000 divided by 1.2 is the same as 1000 * (10/12) = 1000 * 5/6 = 5000/6 ≈ 833.333... so, 1,000,000 / 1200 = 833.333..., so x = 833.333... * 1.50 multiply 833.333... by 1.5: 833.333... * 1 = 833.333... 833.333... * 0.5 = 416.666... adding those together gives 833.333... + 416.666... = 1250. exactly. so that confirms it. so the answer is $1250. wait, but this contradicts my earlier result? wait, hold on. when i did the first method, converting the rate to lire per dollar, i got 800 lire per dollar, so 1,000,000 / 800 = 1250. then when i set up the proportion, i did 1200 / 1.50 = 1,000,000 / x, solved for x and got 1250. so both methods give the same result. so why was there confusion? there wasn't actually a contradiction; both methods confirm the same answer. so the answer is $1250. wait, but maybe i need to check the calculation again because intuitively, if 1200 lire = $1.50, then 1,000,000 lire should be how many dollars? if 1200l = $1.50, then to find how many dollars in 1l, we do 1.50 / 1200 ≈ 0.00125 dollars per lira. then multiply by 1,000,000 lira: 0.00125 * 1,000,000 = 1250. yep. alternatively, 1200 lire → $1.50, so per 1,000,000 lire, how many 1200 lire units are there? 1,000,000 / 1200 = 833.333..., then multiply by $1.50 gives 833.333... * 1.5 = 1250. same result. so all methods lead to $1250. therefore, the final answer is 1250.

answer: given that a scoop of gelato cost 1200 lire in italy and $1.50 in the u.s. in 1992, we can determine the exchange rate between lire and dollars. 

first, we set up the equivalence:
\[ 1200 \text{ lire} = 1.50 \text{ dollars} \]

to find the exchange rate in terms of dollars per lire, we solve for the dollar value of 1 lire:
\[ 1 \text{ lira} = \frac{1.50}{1200} \text{ dollars} = 0.00125 \text{ dollars} \]

next, we use this exchange rate to convert 1,000,000 lire to dollars:
\[ 1,000,000 \text{ lire} \times 0.00125 \text{ dollars/lira} = 1250 \text{ dollars} \]

we can also verify this by setting up a proportion:
\[ \frac{1200 \text{ lire}}{1.50 \text{ dollars}} = \frac{1,000,000 \text{ lire}}{x \text{ dollars}} \]

solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{1,000,000 \times 1.50}{1200} = \frac{1,500,000}{1200} = 1250 \]

both methods confirm the same result. therefore, the number of dollars equivalent to 1,000,000 lire is:
\[ \boxed{1250} \]

the final answer is 1250
