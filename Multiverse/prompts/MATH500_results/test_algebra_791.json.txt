Okay, let's see. The problem says that there are positive integers a, b, and 2009, where a < b < 2009, and they form a geometric sequence with an integer ratio. I need to find a.
First, let me recall what a geometric sequence is. In a geometric sequence, each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed ratio, right? So if a, b, and 2009 are in a geometric sequence, then the ratio between b and a should be the same as the ratio between 2009 and b. Let's write that as equations.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: The ratio r is expressed in terms of b and a.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: The ratio r is expressed in terms of 2009 and b.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The ratio r is defined as r = b/a.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The common ratio r can be expressed as 2009/b.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The common ratio r is determined by either r = b/a or r = 2009/b.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Since both expressions represent the same ratio r, they can be set equal to each other, leading to the equation b/a = 2009/b.
Rearranging this equation gives b^2 = 2009a.
The problem states that the ratio is an integer, so r must be an integer.
Therefore, r = b/a and r = 2009/b must both be integers.
Let me note that.
So, since r is an integer, b must be a multiple of a, and 2009 must be a multiple of b.
Let me write that as: b = a * r 2009 = b * r Therefore, substituting the first into the second, 2009 = a * r^2
So, 2009 must be equal to a multiplied by r squared.
Since a, b, and 2009 are positive integers with a < b < 2009, and r is a positive integer greater than 1 (since a < b implies r > 1).
So, our goal is to find all possible values of a and r such that 2009 = a * r^2, where r is an integer greater than 1, and a is a positive integer.
Therefore, a must be a divisor of 2009, and r^2 must also be a divisor of 2009.
So first, let's factorize 2009 to understand its divisors.
Let me check: 2009 divided by 7? 7*287=2009? Wait, 7*280=1960, 280+7=287, 7*287=2009. So 2009=7*287.
Then factorizing 287: 287 divided by 7? 7*41=287? 7*40=280, 280+7=287, no. 287 divided by 41 is 7 (since 41*7=287). So 287=41*7. Therefore, 2009=7*41*7. Wait, so 2009=7^2*41. Yes, because 7*7*41=49*41=2009. Okay, so prime factorization of 2009 is 7^2 * 41.
Therefore, since 2009 = a * r^2, and a and r^2 must be divisors of 2009, which has prime factors 7 and 41.
So possible divisors of 2009 are 1, 7, 49, 41, 287, 2009.
Wait, let me list them out:
Factors of 2009: 1, 7, 41, 49, 287, 2009.
Since 2009 = 7^2 * 41, the divisors are generated by 7^a * 41^b where a=0,1,2 and b=0,1.
So:
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: The divisor when a=0 and b=0.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: The divisor when a=0 and b=1.
</Outline>
<Outline>
3: The divisor when a=1 and b=0.
</Outline>
<Outline>
4: The divisor when a=1 and b=1.
</Outline>
<Outline>
5: The divisor when a=2 and b=0.
</Outline>
<Outline>
6: The divisor when a=2 and b=1.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The divisor is 1 when a=0 and b=0.
</Path>
<Path>
2: Setting a=0 and b=1 yields the divisor 41.
</Path>
<Path>
3: When a=1 and b=0, the divisor is 7.
</Path>
<Path>
4: For a=1 and b=1, the divisor is 7 * 41, which equals 287.
</Path>
<Path>
5: The divisor is 7^2 = 49 when a=2 and b=0.
</Path>
<Path>
6: The divisor is 7^2 * 41^1 = 49 * 41 = 2009.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The complete set of divisors for 2009, derived from the prime factorization 7^2 * 41, is {1, 7, 41, 49, 287, 2009}.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So the divisors are 1,7,41,49,287,2009.
Now, since 2009 = a * r^2, and r is an integer greater than 1, and a is a positive integer.
So, possible values for r^2 must be perfect squares. So from the divisors of 2009, which are 1,7,41,49,287,2009, the perfect square divisors are 1, 49.
Because 49 is 7^2, and 1 is 1^2. The others are not perfect squares. But since r is an integer greater than 1, then r^2 must be at least 4.
However, in the factorization of 2009, the only perfect square divisors available are 1 and 49. Therefore, since r^2 must be a divisor of 2009 and greater than 1, the only possible r^2 is 49. Therefore, r=7.
Therefore, r=7, so a = 2009 / r^2 = 2009 / 49 = 41.
Wait, 49*41=2009, so yes, 2009=41*7^2, so a=41, r=7. Then the terms would be a=41, b=41*7=287, and 2009. So 41, 287, 2009. Let's check if this is a geometric sequence with ratio 7. Each term multiplied by 7 gives the next term: 41*7=287, 287*7=2009. Yes, that works. So a=41.
But wait, the problem states that a < b < 2009. Here, 41 < 287 < 2009, which is true. So this seems to be the answer.
But let me check if there are other possibilities. Because when we think about the divisors, maybe a can be different. Wait, but the only possible r^2 is 49, since 1 would imply r=1, which is not allowed. The next perfect square divisor is 49. If r=7, then a=41, which is the case above. If we tried other combinations, like maybe a is 7, but then what would r be? Let's see. Suppose someone thought r= something else. Wait, but since 2009 = a * r^2, so a has to be 2009 / r^2. Since a must be an integer, r^2 must divide 2009. But the only divisors of 2009 that are perfect squares are 1 and 49. So unless 2009 has other perfect square divisors, which it doesn't (since its prime factorization is 7^2*41, so exponents are 2 and 1. The perfect square divisor can only be 7^2). Therefore, the only possible r is 7, which gives a=41. Hence, the answer is a=41.
Wait, but just to make sure, let's check if there could be another way. Suppose someone considers that the sequence is a, ar, ar^2, but since the sequence here is a, b, 2009, which would be a, ar, ar^2=2009. So ar^2=2009, so a=2009/r^2. Since a must be a positive integer, r^2 must divide 2009. Therefore, as above, only possible r^2 is 49, so r=7, which leads to a=41. Alternatively, maybe people might think that ratio is between a and b, and then a different ratio between b and 2009, but the problem says the sequence is geometric with integer ratio. So the ratio is the same between each consecutive terms, and the ratio is an integer. Therefore, it can't have one ratio from a to b and another from b to 2009. So it must be that the ratio is constant. Therefore, the equations hold as I set before. Therefore, a=41 is the correct answer. But let me check with r= something else. Suppose someone tries r=2, then a=2009 / 4, which is 502.25, which is not integer, so invalid. Similarly for r=3: 2009/9=223.222..., not integer. r=5: 2009/25=80.36, not integer. So only r=7 gives a as 41, which is integer. So seems correct. Therefore, the answer should be 41.
**Final Answer** 
\boxed{41}
</Think>

Answer: Given positive integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(2009\) forming a geometric sequence with an integer ratio, where \(a < b < 2009\), we need to find \(a\).

In a geometric sequence, the ratio between consecutive terms is constant. Let \(r\) be the integer ratio. Then:
\[
b = ar \quad \text{and} \quad 2009 = ar^2
\]

We need to find \(a\) and \(r\) such that \(a\) is a positive integer, \(r\) is an integer greater than 1, and \(2009 = ar^2\). 

First, we factorize 2009:
\[
2009 = 7^2 \times 41
\]

The divisors of 2009 are 1, 7, 41, 49, 287, and 2009. Since \(r^2\) must be a perfect square divisor of 2009, the possible values for \(r^2\) are 1 and 49. Since \(r > 1\), we have \(r^2 = 49\), which gives \(r = 7\).

Substituting \(r = 7\) into the equation \(2009 = ar^2\):
\[
2009 = a \times 49 \implies a = \frac{2009}{49} = 41
\]

Thus, the terms of the sequence are \(a = 41\), \(b = 41 \times 7 = 287\), and \(2009\), which form a geometric sequence with ratio 7. 

Therefore, the value of \(a\) is \(\boxed{41}\).

</conclusion>
</parallel>
since both expressions represent the same ratio r, they can be set equal to each other, leading to the equation b/a = 2009/b.
rearranging this equation gives b^2 = 2009a.
the problem states that the ratio is an integer, so r must be an integer.
therefore, r = b/a and r = 2009/b must both be integers.
let me note that.
so, since r is an integer, b must be a multiple of a, and 2009 must be a multiple of b.
let me write that as: b = a * r 2009 = b * r therefore, substituting the first into the second, 2009 = a * r^2
so, 2009 must be equal to a multiplied by r squared.
since a, b, and 2009 are positive integers with a < b < 2009, and r is a positive integer greater than 1 (since a < b implies r > 1).
so, our goal is to find all possible values of a and r such that 2009 = a * r^2, where r is an integer greater than 1, and a is a positive integer.

let me check: 2009 divided by 7? 7*287=2009? wait, 7*280=1960, 280+7=287, 7*287=2009. so 2009=7*287.
then factorizing 287: 287 divided by 7? 7*41=287? 7*40=280, 280+7=287, no. 287 divided by 41 is 7 (since 41*7=287). so 287=41*7. therefore, 2009=7*41*7. wait, so 2009=7^2*41. yes, because 7*7*41=49*41=2009. okay, so prime factorization of 2009 is 7^2 * 41.
therefore, since 2009 = a * r^2, and a and r^2 must be divisors of 2009, which has prime factors 7 and 41.
so possible divisors of 2009 are 1, 7, 49, 41, 287, 2009.
wait, let me list them out:
factors of 2009: 1, 7, 41, 49, 287, 2009.
since 2009 = 7^2 * 41, the divisors are generated by 7^a * 41^b where a=0,1,2 and b=0,1.
so:

so the divisors are 1,7,41,49,287,2009.
now, since 2009 = a * r^2, and r is an integer greater than 1, and a is a positive integer.
so, possible values for r^2 must be perfect squares. so from the divisors of 2009, which are 1,7,41,49,287,2009, the perfect square divisors are 1, 49.
because 49 is 7^2, and 1 is 1^2. the others are not perfect squares. but since r is an integer greater than 1, then r^2 must be at least 4.

therefore, r=7, so a = 2009 / r^2 = 2009 / 49 = 41.
wait, 49*41=2009, so yes, 2009=41*7^2, so a=41, r=7. then the terms would be a=41, b=41*7=287, and 2009. so 41, 287, 2009. let's check if this is a geometric sequence with ratio 7. each term multiplied by 7 gives the next term: 41*7=287, 287*7=2009. yes, that works. so a=41.

**final answer** 
\boxed{41}
</think>

answer: given positive integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(2009\) forming a geometric sequence with an integer ratio, where \(a < b < 2009\), we need to find \(a\).

in a geometric sequence, the ratio between consecutive terms is constant. let \(r\) be the integer ratio. then:
\[
b = ar \quad \text{and} \quad 2009 = ar^2
\]

we need to find \(a\) and \(r\) such that \(a\) is a positive integer, \(r\) is an integer greater than 1, and \(2009 = ar^2\). 

first, we factorize 2009:
\[
2009 = 7^2 \times 41
\]

the divisors of 2009 are 1, 7, 41, 49, 287, and 2009. since \(r^2\) must be a perfect square divisor of 2009, the possible values for \(r^2\) are 1 and 49. since \(r > 1\), we have \(r^2 = 49\), which gives \(r = 7\).

substituting \(r = 7\) into the equation \(2009 = ar^2\):
\[
2009 = a \times 49 \implies a = \frac{2009}{49} = 41
\]

thus, the terms of the sequence are \(a = 41\), \(b = 41 \times 7 = 287\), and \(2009\), which form a geometric sequence with ratio 7. 

therefore, the value of \(a\) is \(\boxed{41}\)
