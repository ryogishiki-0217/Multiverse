Okay, so I need to find the value of this product of logarithms: log base 2 of 3 times log base 3 of 4 times log base 4 of 5, and so on up to log base 7 of 8.
Hmm, that's an interesting problem.
Let me see how to approach this.
First off, maybe I should recall some logarithm properties that could help simplify this product.
Right off the bat, I remember that there's a change of base formula for logarithms.
The change of base formula says that log_b{a} = log_c{a} / log_c{b} for any positive number c not equal to 1.
Could this be useful here?
Maybe if I change all the logarithms to the same base, then multiply them together?
Let me think.
Let's suppose I change all the logs to base 10 for simplicity.
Then each term would be log{3}/log{2} * log{4}/log{3} * log{5}/log{4} * ... * log{8}/log{7}.
Oh, wait, that's an interesting telescoping pattern!
Let me write that out step by step.
First term: log_2{3} = log{3}/log{2}
Second term: log_3{4} = log{4}/log{3}
Third term: log_4{5} = log{5}/log{4}
Fourth term: log_5{6} = log{6}/log{5}
Fifth term: log_6{7} = log{7}/log{6}
Sixth term: log_7{8} = log{8}/log{7}
When I multiply all these together, let's see:
(log{3}/log{2}) * (log{4}/log{3}) * (log{5}/log{4}) * (log{6}/log{5}) * (log{7}/log{6}) * (log{8}/log{7})
Look at that!
It's a telescoping product.
Let me write that out more clearly to see the cancellation.
Each numerator cancels with the denominator of the next fraction.
So:
- The log{3} in the numerator cancels with the log{3} in the denominator of the next term.
- Similarly, log{4} cancels with the log{4} in the denominator of the third term.
- This continues all the way through.
So after all the cancellation, what's left?
Let's see:
Starting from the first term, the denominator is log{2}, which doesn't get canceled because no previous numerator has log{2}.
Then, moving to the last term, the numerator is log{8}, which doesn't get canceled because there's no subsequent term to cancel it.
So everything in the middle cancels out.
That's really nice.
So the entire product simplifies to log{8} / log{2}.
Wait, that must be a result of telescoping.
So all the intermediate terms cancel out, leaving just log{8} in the numerator and log{2} in the denominator.
So the product is equal to log{8} / log{2}, which is just log base 2 of 8.
Because log{8}/log{2} = log_2{8}.
And log base 2 of 8 is 3, since 2^3 = 8.
So the entire product simplifies down to 3.
Whoa, that's a really elegant result.
Let me verify this again step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.
Original product:
log23 * log34 * log45 * log56 * log67 * log78
Applying change of base (could be any base, I'm using common log for simplicity):
(log3 / log2) * (log4 / log3) * (log5 / log4) * (log6 / log5) * (log7 / log6) * (log8 / log7)
Multiply these fractions together:
Numerator: log3 * log4 * log5 * log6 * log7 * log8
Denominator: log2 * log3 * log4 * log5 * log6 * log7
Then, cancel common terms:
Numerator terms: log3, log4, log5, log6, log7
Denominator terms: log2, log3, log4, log5, log6, log7
So cancel log3, log4, log5, log6, log7 from both numerator and denominator.
What remains:
Numerator: log8
Denominator: log2
Thus, the product is log8 / log2 = log28 = 3
Yes, exactly.
So regardless of the base I choose (since they cancel out), the product simplifies to log8 / log2, which is 3.
Therefore, the answer is 3.
Wait, the problem is presented as a product of logarithms, each pair being consecutive integers, except the bases increment from 2 up to 7, and arguments increment from 3 up to 8.
So, in general, does this kind of telescoping product happen whenever you have a chain of log_a{b} * log_b{c} * log_c{d} * ...?
Yes, exactly.
Because each log_b{c} term's denominator (log{b}) cancels with the previous term's numerator (log{b}), assuming you change all to the same base.
So the intermediate terms all cancel out, leaving only the first denominator and the last numerator.
So, in general, the product of log_a{b} * log_b{c} * log_c{d} * ... * log_z{w} would simplify to log{w}/log{a} = log_a{w}.
That's a useful pattern to recognize.
So in this problem, the product is log2{3} * log3{4} * ... * log7{8}, which telescopes to log2{8} = 3.
Alternatively, could I have done this without changing bases?
Let me see.
Suppose I use the property that log_a{b} * log_b{c} = log_a{c}.
Wait, is that true?
Let's check.
log_a{b} * log_b{c} = (log{b}/log{a}) * (log{c}/log{b}) = log{c}/log{a} = log_a{c}.
Yes!
So that's a useful property.
So multiplying two logarithms where the base of the second is the same as the argument of the first simplifies to a single logarithm with the first base and the second argument.
That's called the chain rule for logarithms.
So if I apply that property repeatedly, the product log_a{b} * log_b{c} * log_c{d} * ... * log_z{w} would simplify to log_a{w}.
So in our case, the product log2{3} * log3{4} * log4{5} * log5{6} * log6{7} * log7{8} would simplify to log2{8} = 3.
Because each previous argument matches the base of the next term.
So, yes, that's another way to see it, using the chain rule for logarithms.
So each successive log's base is the previous log's argument, creating a chain from 2 to 8, which results in log2{8}, which is 3.
So that's even quicker.
I should have thought of that first.
Either way, the result is the same.
I think both methods are valid; one uses change of base explicitly, the other uses the direct property of the product of logarithms telescoping when they form a chain.
But the end result is the same.
Therefore, the answer is 3.
Just to ensure there's no trick here, let me double-check with actual calculation.
Let me compute each term numerically and multiply them step by step.
Compute log2{3} ≈ 1.58496
log3{4} ≈ 1.26186
log4{5} ≈ 1.16096
log5{6} ≈ 1.11328
log6{7} ≈ 1.0860
log7{8} ≈ 1.06863
Now multiply all these approximations together:
Starting with 1.58496 * 1.26186 ≈ 1.58496 * 1.2 = 1.901952 and 1.58496*0.06186≈0.09788; total ≈1.9998 + 0.09788 ≈ 2.09774
Then multiply by 1.16096: 2.09774 * 1.16096 ≈ 2.09774*1 = 2.09774, 2.09774*0.1 = 0.209774, 2.09774*0.06 ≈ 0.125864, 2.09774*0.00096≈0.00201; adding up: 2.09774 + 0.209774 = 2.307514, +0.125864 = 2.433378, +0.00201≈2.435388
Next, multiply by 1.11328: 2.435388 * 1.11328 ≈ 2.435388 + (2.435388*0.11328). First, 2.435388*0.1=0.2435388, 2.435388*0.01328≈2.435388*0.01=0.02435388 and 2.435388*0.00328≈0.007973. So total for the product: 2.435388 + 0.2435388 + 0.02435388 +0.007973≈2.435388 +0.27586568≈2.711254 +0.007973≈2.719227
Multiply by 1.086: 2.719227 * 1.086 ≈2.719227*1=2.719227, 2.719227*0.08=0.217538, 2.719227*0.006≈0.016315. Adding these: 2.719227 +0.217538=2.936765 +0.016315≈2.95308
Multiply by 1.06863: 2.95308 *1.06863≈2.95308*1=2.95308, 2.95308*0.06=0.177185, 2.95308*0.008≈0.023625, 2.95308*0.00063≈0.001866. Adding these up: 2.95308 +0.177185=3.130265 +0.023625=3.15389 +0.001866≈3.155756
Hmm, but wait, log2{8} is exactly 3.
So the approximation gives me about 3.155, which is a bit off.
That suggests that perhaps my manual calculation is not precise enough due to rounding errors.
Alternatively, maybe the exact value is 3, but if I calculate the approximate values step by step, rounding along the way, the error accumulates.
But given that the exact answer is 3, this approximation is close but not exact, which makes sense.
Therefore, trusting the mathematical derivation is correct here, since mathematics with exact values gives 3, while decimal approximations are subject to rounding errors.
Therefore, the correct exact answer is 3.
**Final Answer**
\boxed{3}

Answer: To find the value of \(\log_2{3} \cdot \log_3{4} \cdot \log_4{5} \cdot \log_5{6} \cdot \log_6{7} \cdot \log_7{8}}\), we can use the change of base formula and the property of telescoping products.

First, we apply the change of base formula to each logarithm:
\[
\log_2{3} = \frac{\log{3}}{\log{2}}, \quad \log_3{4} = \frac{\log{4}}{\log{3}}, \quad \log_4{5} = \frac{\log{5}}{\log{4}}, \quad \log_5{6} = \frac{\log{6}}{\log{5}}, \quad \log_6{7} = \frac{\log{7}}{\log{6}}, \quad \log_7{8} = \frac{\log{8}}{\log{7}}
\]

Multiplying these fractions together, we get:
\[
\left(\frac{\log{3}}{\log{2}}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{\log{4}}{\log{3}}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{\log{5}}{\log{4}}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{\log{6}}{\log{5}}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{\log{7}}{\log{6}}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{\log{8}}{\log{7}}\right)
\]

Notice that this is a telescoping product. Most terms in the numerator and denominator cancel out:
\[
\frac{\log{3}}{\log{2}} \cdot \frac{\log{4}}{\log{3}} \cdot \frac{\log{5}}{\log{4}} \cdot \frac{\log{6}}{\log{5}} \cdot \frac{\log{7}}{\log{6}} \cdot \frac{\log{8}}{\log{7}} = \frac{\log{8}}{\log{2}}
\]

Simplifying the remaining expression, we recognize it as \(\log_2{8}\). Since \(8 = 2^3\), we have:
\[
\log_2{8} = \log_2{(2^3)} = 3
\]

Thus, the value of the given product is \(\boxed{3}\).

the final answer is \boxed{3}

so cancel log3, log4, log5, log6, log7 from both numerator and denominator.
what remains:

thus, the product is log8 / log2 = log28 = 3
yes, exactly.

next, multiply by 1.11328: 2.435388 * 1.11328 ≈ 2.435388 + (2.435388*0.11328). first, 2.435388*0.1=0.2435388, 2.435388*0.01328≈2.435388*0.01=0.02435388 and 2.435388*0.00328≈0.007973. so total for the product: 2.435388 + 0.2435388 + 0.02435388 +0.007973≈2.435388 +0.27586568≈2.711254 +0.007973≈2.719227

first, we apply the change of base formula to each logarithm:

\]

multiplying these fractions together, we get:
\[
\left(\frac{\log{3}}{\log{2}}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{\log{4}}{\log{3}}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{\log{5}}{\log{4}}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{\log{6}}{\log{5}}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{\log{7}}{\log{6}}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{\log{8}}{\log{7}}\right)
\]

notice that this is a telescoping product. most terms in the numerator and denominator cancel out:
\[
\frac{\log{3}}{\log{2}} \cdot \frac{\log{4}}{\log{3}} \cdot \frac{\log{5}}{\log{4}} \cdot \frac{\log{6}}{\log{5}} \cdot \frac{\log{7}}{\log{6}} \cdot \frac{\log{8}}{\log{7}} = \frac{\log{8}}{\log{2}}
\]

simplifying the remaining expression, we recognize it as \(\log_2{8}\). since \(8 = 2^3\), we have:
\[
\log_2{8} = \log_2{(2^3)} = 3
