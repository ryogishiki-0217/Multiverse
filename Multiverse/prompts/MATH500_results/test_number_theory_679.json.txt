Okay, so I need to solve this problem about Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie selling Girl Scout cookies and figuring out how much money they have left in cents after converting as many coins into bills as possible.
Let's think in parallel.

<Conclusion>
The individual earnings are $27.47 for Linda, $35.23 for Sherry, $37.37 for June, and $26.52 for Connie.
</Conclusion>

First, I need to add up all the money they earned individually to find the total amount.
Then, once I have the total, I need to figure out how much money would be left in cents after converting as many coins as possible into dollars.
Since dollars are $1.00 each, the leftover amount in cents would just be the total cents modulo 100, right?
Because each dollar is 100 cents, so dividing the total cents by 100 and the remainder would be the leftover cents.
So the key steps are:
1. Convert each person's earnings into cents.
2. Sum all the amounts in cents.
3. Divide the total cents by 100 and find the remainder.
That remainder will be the answer.
Let me start by converting each person's earnings into cents.
I think it's important to note that each dollar amount can be broken into dollars and cents.
For example, $27.47 is 27 dollars and 47 cents.
Since 1 dollar = 100 cents, $27 is 27 * 100 = 2700 cents, and then adding the 47 cents gives a total of 2747 cents.
Similarly, I can do this for each person.
Let's think in parallel.

<Path>
1: Linda's earnings of $27.47 are equivalent to 2700 cents for the dollars plus 47 cents for the cents, resulting in a total of 2747 cents.
</Path>
<Path>
2: Sherry earned $35.23, which converts to 3523 cents by adding 35*100 (3500 cents) and 23 cents.
</Path>
<Path>
3: June's earnings are $37.37. The dollar amount, $37, is converted to 3700 cents, and the 37 cents are added, resulting in a total of 3737 cents for June.
</Path>
<Path>
4: Connie's earnings are $26.52. The $26 component converts to 2600 cents. Adding the 52 cents gives a total of 2652 cents for Connie.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The total earnings in cents are 2747 for Linda, 3523 for Sherry, 3737 for June, and 2652 for Connie.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Now, adding all these up: 2747 + 3523 + 3737 + 2652.
Let me compute this step by step.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: The sum of the first two addends, 2747 and 3523.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: The sum of the third addend, 3737, and the fourth addend, 2652.

2: The sum of the third addend, 3737, and the fourth addend, 2652, is computed as 3737 + 2652, which equals 6389.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The sum of the first two addends, 2747 and 3523, is 6270, and the sum of the third and fourth addends, 3737 and 2652, is 6389.
</Conclusion>

Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: The total sum of all individual earnings in cents.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: The problem of verifying the sum and an alternative strategy.

</Goal>
<Path>
1: The total sum of all individual earnings in cents is calculated by adding 6270 and 6389, resulting in 12659.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The calculated sum of 12659 is checked. The original problem required adding 27.47, 35.23, 37.37, and 26.52 in dollars, summing to $126.60, which is equivalent to 12659 cents (126*100 + 59). This confirms the sum of 12659 cents. An alternative strategy involves summing the dollars and cents separately.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The total sum of all individual earnings is 12659 cents. Verification confirms this sum, and an alternative method of summing dollars and cents separately is considered.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Adding the dollars: 27 + 35 = 62, then 62 + 37 = 99, then 99 + 26 = 125 dollars.
Adding the cents: 47 + 23 = 70, 70 + 37 = 107, 107 + 52 = 159 cents.
So total dollars: 125, total cents: 159.
But 159 cents is more than 100 cents, so we can convert 100 cents into 1 dollar, leaving 59 cents.
So total amount is 125 + 1 = 126 dollars and 59 cents, which is 126.59, matching the previous total of 12659 cents.
So 12659 cents.
Now, the question is: how much money, in cents, was left after they converted as many of the coins into bills as they could?
Since they are converting coins into bills, but in reality, bills are dollars.
So they are converting cents into dollars.
Each dollar bill is 100 cents.
So to see how many dollars they can get, they divide the total cents by 100.
The quotient would be the number of dollars, and the remainder would be the leftover cents.
So 12659 divided by 100.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: The quotient of 12659 divided by 100.

2: The remainder of 12659 divided by 100.

<Path>
1: Dividing 12659 by 100 yields a quotient of 126.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The remainder of 12659 divided by 100 is 59.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The division of 12659 by 100 results in a quotient of 126 and a remainder of 59.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Therefore, they can convert 126 dollars (as bills) and have 59 cents left.
So the answer is 59 cents.
But wait, let me confirm once more.
Total is $126.59.
Converting as many coins into bills as possible: each bill is $1, so $126 would be 126 bills, leaving $0.59, which is 59 cents.
So yes, the money left in cents is 59.
Therefore, the final answer is 59 cents.
Wait, but the problem says "how much money, in cents, was left... " so the answer is 59, and I should write "the final answer is 59".
Wait, but let me just check again.
Total in cents is 12659.
12659 divided by 100 is 126.59.
The decimal part is .59, which is 59 cents.
So yes, 59.
Wait, but another way: If they convert as many coins into dollars as possible, each dollar is 100 cents.
So the maximum number of 100 cent coins you can get from 12659 cents is 126, because 126*100=12600.
Subtracting 12659-12600=59.
So 59 cents is correct.
Perfect, so no problem.
The answer is 59.
**Final Answer** 
the final answer is 59
</Think>

Answer: First, we convert each person's earnings into cents:

- Linda earned $27.47, which is \(27 \times 100 + 47 = 2747\) cents.
- Sherry earned $35.23, which is \(35 \times 100 + 23 = 3523\) cents.
- June earned $37.37, which is \(37 \times 100 + 37 = 3737\) cents.
- Connie earned $26.52, which is \(26 \times 100 + 52 = 2652\) cents.

Next, we sum these amounts:
\[
2747 + 3523 + 3737 + 2652
\]

Breaking it down step-by-step:
\[
2747 + 3523 = 6270
\]
\[
3737 + 2652 = 6389
\]
\[
6270 + 6389 = 12659
\]

The total amount in cents is 12659. To find the remainder after converting as many coins into dollars (100 cents each) as possible, we divide 12659 by 100:
\[
12659 \div 100 = 126 \text{ dollars with a remainder of } 59 \text{ cents}
\]

Thus, the amount of money left in cents is:
\[
\boxed{59}
\]

so total dollars: 125, total cents: 159.

answer: first, we convert each person's earnings into cents:

- linda earned $27.47, which is \(27 \times 100 + 47 = 2747\) cents.
- sherry earned $35.23, which is \(35 \times 100 + 23 = 3523\) cents.
- june earned $37.37, which is \(37 \times 100 + 37 = 3737\) cents.
- connie earned $26.52, which is \(26 \times 100 + 52 = 2652\) cents.

next, we sum these amounts:
\[
2747 + 3523 + 3737 + 2652
\]

breaking it down step-by-step:
\[
2747 + 3523 = 6270
\]
\[
3737 + 2652 = 6389
\]
\[
6270 + 6389 = 12659
\]

the total amount in cents is 12659. to find the remainder after converting as many coins into dollars (100 cents each) as possible, we divide 12659 by 100:
\[
12659 \div 100 = 126 \text{ dollars with a remainder of } 59 \text{ cents}
\]

thus, the amount of money left in cents is:
\[
\boxed{59}
\]
