Okay, let me try to figure out this problem.
So, Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie sold girl scout cookies and earned different amounts: Linda earned $27.47, Sherry earned $35.23, June earned $37.37, and Connie earned $26.52.
Then they pooled all their money together and went to the bank to convert coins into dollars.
The question is asking how much money, in cents, was left after they converted as many coins into bills as they could.
Hmm, so first I need to add up all the money they earned individually to find the total amount.
After that, I have to figure out how many cents are left after converting as many coins as possible into dollars.
Since dollars are 100 cents each, I need to find the total amount in cents and then find the remainder when divided by 100, right?
Let's think in parallel.

1: The individual earnings are $27.47 for Linda, $35.23 for Sherry, $37.37 for June, and $26.52 for Connie. The total dollar amount is found by summing these values. The sum of the dollars is 27 + 35 + 37 + 26, which equals 125 dollars. The sum of the cents is 47 + 23 + 37 + 52. The sum of the cents components (47+23) is 70. The sum of the remaining cents components (37+52) is 89. Adding these intermediate sums (70+89) gives a total of 159 cents.

2: The total cents earned by all four individuals are calculated. For Linda, $27.47 converts to 27 dollars and 47 cents. Sherry's $35.23 converts to 35 dollars and 23 cents. June's $37.37 converts to 37 dollars and 37 cents. Connie's $26.52 converts to 26 dollars and 52 cents. The total cents are found by summing the individual cents amounts: 47 + 23 + 37 + 52. The sum of 47 and 23 is 70. The sum of 70 and 37 is 107. The sum of 107 and 52 is 159.

Wait, 125 dollars and 159 cents.
But 100 cents make a dollar, so 159 cents is 1 dollar and 59 cents.
So adding that extra dollar to the total dollars: 125 + 1 = 126 dollars, and 59 cents remaining.
Therefore, after converting as many coins into bills as possible, they have 126 dollars and 59 cents, which means 59 cents are left.
So the answer is 59 cents.
But wait, let me verify this step by step.
First, adding the dollars: Linda's 27, Sherry's 35, June's 37, Connie's 26.
27 + 35 is 62, plus 37 is 99, plus 26 is 125.
So total dollars: 125.
Now adding the cents: Linda's 47, Sherry's 23, June's 37, Connie's 52.
Let's add them: 47 + 23 = 70, 70 + 37 = 107, 107 + 52 = 159 cents.
159 cents divided by 100 is 1 dollar with 59 cents remaining.
So total money becomes 125 + 1 = 126 dollars and 59 cents.
Therefore, 59 cents left.
Wait, is that correct?
The problem says "how much money, in cents, was left after they converted as many of the coins into bills as they could."
So if they had, say, dollars in coins (like 100 cents = 1 dollar), but when you pool all the change together, after converting all possible coins into dollar bills, how many cents remain?
So in this case, the total cents after adding up all the cents from each person was 159.
Then, since 100 cents make a dollar, they can convert 100 cents into 1 dollar, leaving 59 cents.
But then the total dollars increased by 1, from 125 to 126.
So the remaining cents are 59.
So the answer is 59 cents.
But let me confirm again.
Total money earned: Each person's total is $27.47 + $35.23 + $37.37 + $26.52.
Let me compute the total in dollars and cents separately to verify.
Dollars: 27 + 35 + 37 + 26 = 125.
Cents: 47 + 23 + 37 + 52.
Compute each: 47 + 23 = 70, 70 + 37 = 107, 107 + 52 = 159.
So total cents: 159.
159 cents = 1 dollar and 59 cents.
So total amount becomes 125 + 1 = 126 dollars and 59 cents.
Hence, 59 cents left.
But wait, the question is a bit tricky.
When they pool their money together, the total is $126.59.
But did they first pool all their coins and then convert, or did they convert their individual amounts first and then pool?
Wait, the problem says: "After the sale, they pooled their money together and went to the bank to convert the coins into dollars."
So they first added up all their money (both dollars and coins) and then converted the coins into dollars.
So if each of their amounts is given in dollars and cents, when they pool their money, they sum all the dollars and all the cents.
Then, the total cents might be more than a dollar, so they convert those excess cents into dollars.
So as I did before, total cents 159, which is 1 dollar 59 cents, add that to 125 dollars, makes 126 dollars 59 cents.
Therefore, after converting, they have 126 dollars and 59 cents, so 59 cents left.
But wait, the problem says "they converted the coins into dollars".
So maybe they exchanged all the coins for paper money?
Wait, but coins include cents (pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters).
So converting coins into dollars would mean exchanging the cents for dollars.
But in reality, when you go to the bank with a pile of coins, the bank can exchange that pile with paper money.
So if you have, say, 250 cents (which is $2.50), the bank would give you two one-dollar bills and a half-dollar, but maybe in this problem, they just convert as many cents as possible into dollars.
So if you have 159 cents, that's 1 dollar and 59 cents, so they convert 100 cents (1 dollar) into a dollar bill, leaving 59 cents.
But the question says "after they converted as many of the coins into bills as they could", so converting cents into dollar bills.
So each 100 cents becomes 1 dollar bill.
So if they have total X cents, then they can convert floor(X/100) dollars, and have X mod 100 cents left.
So in this case, X is 159, floor(159/100)=1, and 159 mod 100=59.
Therefore, 59 cents left.
So the answer is 59 cents.
But let me check once more.
If the total cents summed up is 159, then 159 cents = 1 dollar 59 cents.
So when they pool their money, they have 125 dollars + 1 dollar = 126 dollars and 59 cents.
Therefore, the leftover is 59 cents.
Therefore, the answer is 59 cents.
But wait, the problem could be interpreted differently.
Suppose each person had their money in bills and cents, but when they pool their money, maybe the dollars are separate and the cents are separate.
So total dollars would be 125, total cents would be 47 + 23 + 37 + 52 = 159.
Then, they can convert 100 cents into 1 dollar, so total dollars becomes 125 + 1 = 126, and remaining cents 59.
So 59 cents left.
Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking, if you add all the money, then take the total amount, and see how many cents are left after converting to bills.
Wait, but bills come in denominations of $1, $5, $10, etc.
But the problem says "converted the coins into dollars", so probably into $1 bills.
Since coins are cents, to convert cents into dollars, each $1 is 100 cents.
So they would exchange as many 100 cents as possible for $1 bills.
So if they have total cents C, then C = 159, so they can get 1 * $1 bill, and have 59 cents left.
So yeah, 59 cents.
Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the total amount in cents modulo 100.
So total money: $27.47 + $35.23 + $37.37 + $26.52.
Let me compute that in decimal:
27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59
Total is $126.59.
So $126 and 59 cents.
So the amount left is 59 cents.
Therefore, the answer is 59 cents.
So the final answer is 59.
But wait, let me make sure that the problem isn't asking about leftover after converting as many cents as possible into all denominations of bills.
But that would be more complicated.
For example, if they had $126.59, then $126 is 126 dollars, and 59 cents.
So when they converted coins (cents) into dollars, the maximum they can convert is 100 cents to 1 dollar, but here they have 59 cents remaining.
Wait, no, wait: If they have $126.59, that's 126 dollars and 59 cents.
The coins they had initially were the 59 cents.
Wait, but this is where the problem might be slightly ambiguous.
Let me read it again.
"Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie walked around their neighborhoods selling girl scout cookies. Linda earned $27.47, Sherry earned $35.23, June earned $37.37$, and Connie earned $26.52$. After the sale, they pooled their money together and went to the bank to convert the coins into dollars. How much money, in cents, was left after they converted as many of the coins into bills as they could?"
So each of their earnings includes dollars and cents.
When they pool their money, they have total dollars and total cents.
Then they convert the coins (the cents part) into dollars.
So the total cents they have is 159, which is 1 dollar 59 cents.
So converting that 100 cents into one dollar, and the remaining 59 cents can't be converted, so that's left.
So the total dollars become 125 + 1 = 126, and 59 cents left.
Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering all the money, not just the cents.
But if you think of converting coins into dollars, coins refer to cents, so probably just the cents part.
But maybe not.
Let's suppose the problem is that they had all their money in coins, which is not practical, but perhaps.
But each earned tens of dollars, so maybe they had a mix.
But the problem says they earned $27.47, etc., so each amount is dollars and cents.
So when they pool their money, the total is 126 dollars and 59 cents.
Then they go to the bank to convert the coins (the 59 cents) into dollars.
But 59 cents is less than a dollar, so they can't convert it into a bill.
So the leftover is 59 cents.
Wait, no, the problem says "converted the coins into dollars", so maybe all the coins (cents) they had.
But initially, their earnings are given with cents, so the coins they had were 47 + 23 + 37 + 52 cents.
When they pool those coins, they have 159 cents.
Then they convert 159 cents into dollars.
Since 100 cents = 1 dollar, so they can get 1 dollar and have 59 cents left.
So the answer is 59 cents.
But wait, another way: The total amount in cents.
Each person's earnings in cents: Linda 2747 cents, Sherry 3523 cents, June 3737 cents, Connie 2652 cents.
Total cents: 2747 + 3523 + 3737 + 2652.
Then, summing these:
2747 + 3523 = 6270
6270 + 3737 = 10007
10007 + 2652 = 12659 cents.
Total cents: 12659.
Now, converting as many cents into bills as possible.
A bill is $1 = 100 cents.
So 12659 divided by 100 is 126.59.
So 126 dollars and 59 cents.
Therefore, 59 cents left.
So same answer.
So regardless of whether you compute it as dollars and cents or total cents, the remainder is 59 cents.
Therefore, the answer is 59 cents.
So the final answer is 59 cents.
Wait, but the problem says "how much money, in cents, was left".
So 59 cents.
So the answer is 59.
Let me just check with another method.
Take each person's cents:
Linda: 47, Sherry: 23, June: 37, Connie: 52.
Adding them: 47 + 23 = 70; 70 + 37 = 107; 107 + 52 = 159.
159 cents.
Converting to dollars: 159 / 100 = 1 with remainder 59.
So 1 dollar and 59 cents.
So total dollars become 125 + 1 = 126, and 59 cents left.
Yes.
Therefore, the answer is 59 cents.
So the final answer is \boxed{59}.
But wait, the problem says "after they converted as many of the coins into bills as they could".
So if they had 159 cents, they could convert 100 cents into a dollar bill, but they can't convert the remaining 59 cents into a bill because it's less than a dollar.
So those 59 cents remain as coins.
Therefore, the money left in cents is 59.
Hence, the answer is 59.
Yes, this seems correct.
</Think>

Answer: First, we calculate the total amount of money earned by adding each individual's earnings:

- Linda earned $27.47
- Sherry earned $35.23
- June earned $37.37
- Connie earned $26.52

Summing these amounts:

\[
27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
\]

Breaking this down into dollars and cents:

**Dollars:**
\[
27 + 35 + 37 + 26 = 125 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Cents:**
\[
47 + 23 + 37 + 52 = 159 \text{ cents}
\]

Converting the total cents into dollars and remaining cents:

\[
159 \text{ cents} = 1 \text{ dollar and } 59 \text{ cents}
\]

Adding the converted dollar to the total dollars:

\[
125 + 1 = 126 \text{ dollars}
\]

The remaining cents after conversion are 59. Therefore, the amount of money left in cents after converting as many coins into bills as possible is:

\[
\boxed{59}
\]

wait, 125 dollars and 159 cents.
but 100 cents make a dollar, so 159 cents is 1 dollar and 59 cents.
so adding that extra dollar to the total dollars: 125 + 1 = 126 dollars, and 59 cents remaining.
therefore, after converting as many coins into bills as possible, they have 126 dollars and 59 cents, which means 59 cents are left.
so the answer is 59 cents.
but wait, let me verify this step by step.
first, adding the dollars: linda's 27, sherry's 35, june's 37, connie's 26.
27 + 35 is 62, plus 37 is 99, plus 26 is 125.
so total dollars: 125.
now adding the cents: linda's 47, sherry's 23, june's 37, connie's 52.
let's add them: 47 + 23 = 70, 70 + 37 = 107, 107 + 52 = 159 cents.
159 cents divided by 100 is 1 dollar with 59 cents remaining.
so total money becomes 125 + 1 = 126 dollars and 59 cents.
therefore, 59 cents left.
wait, is that correct?
the problem says "how much money, in cents, was left after they converted as many of the coins into bills as they could."
so if they had, say, dollars in coins (like 100 cents = 1 dollar), but when you pool all the change together, after converting all possible coins into dollar bills, how many cents remain?
so in this case, the total cents after adding up all the cents from each person was 159.
then, since 100 cents make a dollar, they can convert 100 cents into 1 dollar, leaving 59 cents.
but then the total dollars increased by 1, from 125 to 126.
so the remaining cents are 59.
so the answer is 59 cents.
but let me confirm again.
total money earned: each person's total is $27.47 + $35.23 + $37.37 + $26.52.
let me compute the total in dollars and cents separately to verify.
dollars: 27 + 35 + 37 + 26 = 125.
cents: 47 + 23 + 37 + 52.
compute each: 47 + 23 = 70, 70 + 37 = 107, 107 + 52 = 159.
so total cents: 159.
159 cents = 1 dollar and 59 cents.
so total amount becomes 125 + 1 = 126 dollars and 59 cents.
hence, 59 cents left.
but wait, the question is a bit tricky.
when they pool their money together, the total is $126.59.
but did they first pool all their coins and then convert, or did they convert their individual amounts first and then pool?
wait, the problem says: "after the sale, they pooled their money together and went to the bank to convert the coins into dollars."
so they first added up all their money (both dollars and coins) and then converted the coins into dollars.
so if each of their amounts is given in dollars and cents, when they pool their money, they sum all the dollars and all the cents.
then, the total cents might be more than a dollar, so they convert those excess cents into dollars.
so as i did before, total cents 159, which is 1 dollar 59 cents, add that to 125 dollars, makes 126 dollars 59 cents.
therefore, after converting, they have 126 dollars and 59 cents, so 59 cents left.
but wait, the problem says "they converted the coins into dollars".
so maybe they exchanged all the coins for paper money?
wait, but coins include cents (pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters).
so converting coins into dollars would mean exchanging the cents for dollars.
but in reality, when you go to the bank with a pile of coins, the bank can exchange that pile with paper money.
so if you have, say, 250 cents (which is $2.50), the bank would give you two one-dollar bills and a half-dollar, but maybe in this problem, they just convert as many cents as possible into dollars.
so if you have 159 cents, that's 1 dollar and 59 cents, so they convert 100 cents (1 dollar) into a dollar bill, leaving 59 cents.
but the question says "after they converted as many of the coins into bills as they could", so converting cents into dollar bills.
so each 100 cents becomes 1 dollar bill.
so if they have total x cents, then they can convert floor(x/100) dollars, and have x mod 100 cents left.
so in this case, x is 159, floor(159/100)=1, and 159 mod 100=59.
therefore, 59 cents left.
so the answer is 59 cents.
but let me check once more.
if the total cents summed up is 159, then 159 cents = 1 dollar 59 cents.
so when they pool their money, they have 125 dollars + 1 dollar = 126 dollars and 59 cents.
therefore, the leftover is 59 cents.
therefore, the answer is 59 cents.
but wait, the problem could be interpreted differently.
suppose each person had their money in bills and cents, but when they pool their money, maybe the dollars are separate and the cents are separate.
so total dollars would be 125, total cents would be 47 + 23 + 37 + 52 = 159.
then, they can convert 100 cents into 1 dollar, so total dollars becomes 125 + 1 = 126, and remaining cents 59.
so 59 cents left.
alternatively, maybe the problem is asking, if you add all the money, then take the total amount, and see how many cents are left after converting to bills.
wait, but bills come in denominations of $1, $5, $10, etc.
but the problem says "converted the coins into dollars", so probably into $1 bills.
since coins are cents, to convert cents into dollars, each $1 is 100 cents.
so they would exchange as many 100 cents as possible for $1 bills.
so if they have total cents c, then c = 159, so they can get 1 * $1 bill, and have 59 cents left.
so yeah, 59 cents.
alternatively, perhaps the question is about the total amount in cents modulo 100.
so total money: $27.47 + $35.23 + $37.37 + $26.52.
let me compute that in decimal:
27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59
total is $126.59.
so $126 and 59 cents.
so the amount left is 59 cents.
therefore, the answer is 59 cents.
so the final answer is 59.
but wait, let me make sure that the problem isn't asking about leftover after converting as many cents as possible into all denominations of bills.
but that would be more complicated.
for example, if they had $126.59, then $126 is 126 dollars, and 59 cents.

"linda, sherry, june, and connie walked around their neighborhoods selling girl scout cookies. linda earned $27.47, sherry earned $35.23, june earned $37.37$, and connie earned $26.52$. after the sale, they pooled their money together and went to the bank to convert the coins into dollars. how much money, in cents, was left after they converted as many of the coins into bills as they could?"
so each of their earnings includes dollars and cents.
when they pool their money, they have total dollars and total cents.
then they convert the coins (the cents part) into dollars.
so the total cents they have is 159, which is 1 dollar 59 cents.
so converting that 100 cents into one dollar, and the remaining 59 cents can't be converted, so that's left.
so the total dollars become 125 + 1 = 126, and 59 cents left.
alternatively, maybe the problem is considering all the money, not just the cents.
but if you think of converting coins into dollars, coins refer to cents, so probably just the cents part.
but maybe not.
let's suppose the problem is that they had all their money in coins, which is not practical, but perhaps.
but each earned tens of dollars, so maybe they had a mix.
but the problem says they earned $27.47, etc., so each amount is dollars and cents.
so when they pool their money, the total is 126 dollars and 59 cents.
then they go to the bank to convert the coins (the 59 cents) into dollars.
but 59 cents is less than a dollar, so they can't convert it into a bill.
so the leftover is 59 cents.
wait, no, the problem says "converted the coins into dollars", so maybe all the coins (cents) they had.
but initially, their earnings are given with cents, so the coins they had were 47 + 23 + 37 + 52 cents.
when they pool those coins, they have 159 cents.
then they convert 159 cents into dollars.
since 100 cents = 1 dollar, so they can get 1 dollar and have 59 cents left.
so the answer is 59 cents.
but wait, another way: the total amount in cents.
each person's earnings in cents: linda 2747 cents, sherry 3523 cents, june 3737 cents, connie 2652 cents.
total cents: 2747 + 3523 + 3737 + 2652.
then, summing these:
2747 + 3523 = 6270
6270 + 3737 = 10007
10007 + 2652 = 12659 cents.
total cents: 12659.
now, converting as many cents into bills as possible.
a bill is $1 = 100 cents.
so 12659 divided by 100 is 126.59.
so 126 dollars and 59 cents.
therefore, 59 cents left.
so same answer.
so regardless of whether you compute it as dollars and cents or total cents, the remainder is 59 cents.
therefore, the answer is 59 cents.
so the final answer is 59 cents.
wait, but the problem says "how much money, in cents, was left".
so 59 cents.
so the answer is 59.
let me just check with another method.
take each person's cents:
linda: 47, sherry: 23, june: 37, connie: 52.
adding them: 47 + 23 = 70; 70 + 37 = 107; 107 + 52 = 159.
159 cents.
converting to dollars: 159 / 100 = 1 with remainder 59.
so 1 dollar and 59 cents.
so total dollars become 125 + 1 = 126, and 59 cents left.
yes.
therefore, the answer is 59 cents.
so the final answer is \boxed{59}.
but wait, the problem says "after they converted as many of the coins into bills as they could".
so if they had 159 cents, they could convert 100 cents into a dollar bill, but they can't convert the remaining 59 cents into a bill because it's less than a dollar.
so those 59 cents remain as coins.
therefore, the money left in cents is 59.
hence, the answer is 59.
yes, this seems correct.

answer: first, we calculate the total amount of money earned by adding each individual's earnings:

- linda earned $27.47
- sherry earned $35.23
- june earned $37.37
- connie earned $26.52

summing these amounts:

\[
27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
\]

breaking this down into dollars and cents:

**dollars:**
\[
27 + 35 + 37 + 26 = 125 \text{ dollars}
\]

**cents:**
\[
47 + 23 + 37 + 52 = 159 \text{ cents}
\]

converting the total cents into dollars and remaining cents:

\[
159 \text{ cents} = 1 \text{ dollar and } 59 \text{ cents}
\]

adding the converted dollar to the total dollars:

\[
125 + 1 = 126 \text{ dollars}
\]

the remaining cents after conversion are 59. therefore, the amount of money left in cents after converting as many coins into bills as possible is:

\[
\boxed{59}
\]
