Okay, so I need to solve this problem where the expression \(10x^2 - x - 24\) is written as \((Ax - 8)(Bx + 3)\), and I have to find \(AB + B\), where \(A\) and \(B\) are integers.
Alright, let's start by expanding the given factored form and then compare coefficients with the original quadratic expression.
First, let me expand \((Ax - 8)(Bx + 3)\).
To expand this, I multiply each term in the first binomial by each term in the second binomial.
So, multiplying \(Ax\) by \(Bx\) gives \(ABx^2\).
\(Ax\) multiplied by 3 is \(3Ax\).
Then, -8 multiplied by \(Bx\) is \(-8Bx\).
And finally, -8 multiplied by 3 is \(-24\).
Putting it all together, the expanded form is \(ABx^2 + 3Ax - 8Bx - 24\).
Now, let me combine the like terms.
The terms with \(x\) are \(3Ax\) and \(-8Bx\), so combined, that's \((3A - 8B)x\).
The constant term is \(-24\).
So overall, the expanded expression is \(ABx^2 + (3A - 8B)x - 24\).
Now, this expression is supposed to be equal to the original quadratic expression, \(10x^2 - x - 24\).
That means their corresponding coefficients must be equal.
Let's write down the equations for each coefficient:
1. The coefficient of \(x^2\): \(AB = 10\).
2. The coefficient of \(x\): \(3A - 8B = -1\).
3. The constant term: \(-24 = -24\).
Well, the constant terms are already equal, so we don't get additional information from there.
So, our job is to solve the system of equations:
1. \(AB = 10\)
2. \(3A - 8B = -1\)
And \(A\) and \(B\) are integers, so we can use the first equation to find possible integer pairs \((A, B)\) that multiply to 10, then check which of these pairs satisfy the second equation.
Let's think in parallel.

1: The equation AB=10 involves integer factors A and B, implying the integer factor pairs for 10 are (1,10), (2,5), (5,2), (10,1), (-1,-10), (-2,-5), (-5,-2), and (-10,-1).
</Path>
<Path>
2: The integer factor pair (A=1, B=10) is tested in the equation 3A - 8B = -1. Substituting A=1 and B=10 yields 3(1) - 8(10) = 3 - 80 = -77. The result -77 does not equal -1, so this pair is not a solution.
</Path>
<Path>
3: The integer factor pair (A=2, B=5) is tested against the equation 3A - 8B = -1. Substituting A=2 and B=5 into the equation gives 3(2) - 8(5) = 6 - 40 = -34, which does not equal -1. This pair is therefore not a solution.
</Path>
<Path>
4: The factor pair (A=5, B=2) is tested. Substituting A=5 and B=2 into the equation 3A - 8B = -1 yields 3(5) - 8(2) = 15 - 16 = -1. The result is -1, which matches the required value. This pair satisfies the equation.
</Path>
<Path>
5: The pair (A=10, B=1) is considered. Substituting A=10 and B=1 into the equation 3A - 8B = -1 yields 3(10) - 8(1) = 30 - 8 = 22, which does not equal -1. This pair is not a solution.
</Path>

6: For the factor pair (A=-1, B=-10), the left side of the equation 3A - 8B is calculated as 3*(-1) - 8*(-10), which equals -3 + 80, resulting in 77. This does not equal -1, so this pair is not a solution.

8: For the factor pair (A=-5, B=-2), substitution into the equation yields 3*(-5) - 8*(-2) = -15 + 16 = 1. This result (1) does not equal -1, so this pair is not a solution.
</Path>
<Path>
9: The factor pair (A=-10, B=-1) is tested. Substituting A=-10 and B=-1 into the equation 3A - 8B = -1 yields 3*(-10) - 8*(-1) = -30 + 8 = -22, which does not equal -1. This pair is not a solution.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The integer factor pairs (A, B) for the equation AB=10 were determined. Testing these pairs against the equation 3A - 8B = -1 showed that only the pair (A=5, B=2) satisfied this condition.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So the pair \((A, B) = (5, 2)\) satisfies both equations.
Therefore, \(A = 5\) and \(B = 2\).
Now, the problem asks for \(AB + B\).
Let's compute that: \(AB + B = 5 \times 2 + 2 = 10 + 2 = 12\).
Wait, but to confirm, let's double-check.
Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.
First, if \(A = 5\) and \(B = 2\), then substituting back into the factored form:
\((5x - 8)(2x + 3)\).
Let me expand this to see if it equals the original quadratic.
First, \(5x \times 2x = 10x^2\).
\(5x \times 3 = 15x\).
\(-8 \times 2x = -16x\).
\(-8 \times 3 = -24\).
So combining all terms: \(10x^2 + 15x - 16x - 24 = 10x^2 - x - 24\).
Yes, that's correct.
It matches the original expression.
So \(A = 5\), \(B = 2\) is confirmed.
Then, \(AB + B = 5 \times 2 + 2 = 10 + 2 = 12\).
That's the answer.
Wait, just to make sure, the question is not asking for \(A + B\), but \(AB + B\).
Which is 12.
Alternatively, factorizing 10x2 -x -24 using another method, but since we already have it, maybe another way.
Alternatively, using the fact that \(AB=10\) and \(3A -8B = -1\).
But since we already have the solution through substitution, that's straightforward.
Alternatively, cross-multiplication check.
Let me try.
If the factors are (5x -8)(2x +3), then multiplying: 5x*3=15x, -8*2x= -16x.
15x -16x= -1x, which matches the middle term.
So correct.
So, the answer is 12.
**Final Answer** 
\boxed{12}
</Think>

Answer: To solve the problem, we start by expanding the given factored form \((Ax - 8)(Bx + 3)\) and comparing coefficients with the original quadratic expression \(10x^2 - x - 24\).

Expanding \((Ax - 8)(Bx + 3)\):
\[
(Ax - 8)(Bx + 3) = ABx^2 + 3Ax - 8Bx - 24 = ABx^2 + (3A - 8B)x - 24
\]

We compare the coefficients with \(10x^2 - x - 24\):
1. \(AB = 10\)
2. \(3A - 8B = -1\)
3. The constant term \(-24\) is already matched.

Next, we solve the system of equations:
- From \(AB = 10\), we list possible integer pairs \((A, B)\): \((1, 10)\), \((2, 5)\), \((5, 2)\), \((10, 1)\), \((-1, -10)\), \((-2, -5)\), \((-5, -2)\), \((-10, -1)\).

Testing these pairs in the second equation \(3A - 8B = -1\):
- For \((5, 2)\): \(3(5) - 8(2) = 15 - 16 = -1\), which satisfies the equation.

Thus, \(A = 5\) and \(B = 2\). We then compute \(AB + B\):
\[
AB + B = 5 \times 2 + 2 = 10 + 2 = 12
\]

Verifying the factorization \((5x - 8)(2x + 3)\):
\[
5x \cdot 2x = 10x^2, \quad 5x \cdot 3 = 15x, \quad -8 \cdot 2x = -16x, \quad -8 \cdot 3 = -24
\]
Combining terms: \(10x^2 + (15x - 16x) - 24 = 10x^2 - x - 24\), which matches the original expression.

The final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).

answer: to solve the problem, we start by expanding the given factored form \((ax - 8)(bx + 3)\) and comparing coefficients with the original quadratic expression \(10x^2 - x - 24\).

expanding \((ax - 8)(bx + 3)\):
\[
(ax - 8)(bx + 3) = abx^2 + 3ax - 8bx - 24 = abx^2 + (3a - 8b)x - 24
\]

we compare the coefficients with \(10x^2 - x - 24\):
1. \(ab = 10\)
2. \(3a - 8b = -1\)
3. the constant term \(-24\) is already matched.

next, we solve the system of equations:
- from \(ab = 10\), we list possible integer pairs \((a, b)\): \((1, 10)\), \((2, 5)\), \((5, 2)\), \((10, 1)\), \((-1, -10)\), \((-2, -5)\), \((-5, -2)\), \((-10, -1)\).

testing these pairs in the second equation \(3a - 8b = -1\):
- for \((5, 2)\): \(3(5) - 8(2) = 15 - 16 = -1\), which satisfies the equation.

thus, \(a = 5\) and \(b = 2\). we then compute \(ab + b\):
\[
ab + b = 5 \times 2 + 2 = 10 + 2 = 12
\]

verifying the factorization \((5x - 8)(2x + 3)\):
\[
5x \cdot 2x = 10x^2, \quad 5x \cdot 3 = 15x, \quad -8 \cdot 2x = -16x, \quad -8 \cdot 3 = -24
\]
combining terms: \(10x^2 + (15x - 16x) - 24 = 10x^2 - x - 24\), which matches the original expression.

the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\)
