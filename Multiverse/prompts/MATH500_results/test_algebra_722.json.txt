Okay, so I need to compute 99 squared plus 99 plus 1 in my head.
Hmm, let me think.
First, I know that 99 squared is a common square that maybe I should remember.
Wait, but maybe there's a smarter way than just multiplying 99 times 99.
Let's see.
Maybe I can use the formula for (a - b) squared.
Like, 99 is 100 - 1, so (100 - 1)^2 is 100^2 - 2*100*1 + 1^2, right?
So that's 10,000 - 200 + 1, which is 9,801.
So 99^2 is 9,801.
Let me verify that again.
100 squared is 10,000, subtract 2 times 100 which is 200, so 10,000 - 200 is 9,800, then add 1^2 which is 1, so 9,801.
Yep, that's correct.
So the first term is 9,801.
Then I have to add 99 and 1.
So the expression is 9,801 + 99 + 1.
Adding 99 + 1 is 100.
So then 9,801 + 100 is 9,901.
Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mess up.
Wait, original problem: 99^2 + 99 + 1.
So first term is 9,801, then adding 99 and 1.
But if I compute 9,801 +99 first, that would be 9,801 + 100 -1, which is 9,901 -1 = 9,900, then adding 1 gives 9,901.
Wait, but maybe another way: 99^2 + 99 +1.
Alternatively, maybe factor something?
Let me think.
Is there a way to factor this?
Maybe like x^2 + x + 1, where x is 99?
I don't know if that helps.
Alternatively, maybe 99^2 + 99 +1 = 99*(99 +1) +1.
Let's see: 99 +1 is 100, so 99*100 is 9,900, then add 1 gives 9,901.
Oh, that's clever.
So, split it as 99*100 +1.
Because 99^2 +99 is 99*(99 +1).
Yes, that's the way.
So x^2 +x =x(x+1), so then x(x+1) +1.
So when x is 99, that's 99*100 +1.
Which is 9,900 +1 =9,901.
Yes, that works.
So that's a smarter way.
So instead of computing 99 squared first, which is a bigger number, then adding 100, you can notice that 99^2 +99 is just 99*100, because 99*99 +99 is 99*(99+1).
That's factoring, distributive property.
Then you add the extra 1.
So 99*100 is 9,900, plus 1 is 9,901.
So same answer.
So either way, the answer is 9,901.
Let me just check one more way to be safe.
Another way to compute it: maybe 100^2 - something.
Since 99^2 is 100^2 - 2*100*1 +1, as I did earlier, which is 9,801.
Then adding 99 +1 to that.
So 9,801 +100 = 9,901.
Wait, but 99^2 +99 +1 = 99^2 +99 +1.
Wait, maybe another angle.
If I consider 99^2 +99 +1, then perhaps 99^2 +99 is 99*100, as above, so that's 9,900.
Then plus 1 is 9,901.
Alternatively, perhaps using 100^2 - 2*100 +1 (which is 9,801) plus 99 +1.
So 9,801 + 100 is 9,901.
Same answer.
Alternatively, check via another method.
Let me compute 99 * 99.
Let's calculate 99 * 99: 99 * 100 = 9,900, subtract 99, so 9,900 - 99 = 9,801.
That's correct.
So 99^2 is 9,801.
Then adding 99: 9,801 + 99 = 9,900.
Then adding 1 gives 9,901.
Yep.
So through step-by-step addition, it's also correct.
Therefore, the answer is 9,901.
**Final Answer** 
\boxed{9901}
</Think>

Answer: To solve the problem \(99^2 + 99 + 1\), we can use algebraic manipulation and properties of numbers.

1. **Calculate \(99^2\)**:
   - Using the formula \((a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2\) where \(a = 100\) and \(b = 1\):
     \[
     (100 - 1)^2 = 100^2 - 2 \cdot 100 \cdot 1 + 1^2 = 10000 - 200 + 1 = 9801
     \]
   - Therefore, \(99^2 = 9801\).

2. **Add \(99\) and \(1\) to \(9801\)**:
   - Instead of adding them separately, we notice that \(99 + 1 = 100\).
   - Adding this to \(9801\):
     \[
     9801 + 100 = 9901
     \]

3. **Verification using factoring**:
   - Factor \(99^2 + 99\) as \(99(99 + 1)\):
     \[
     99^2 + 99 = 99 \cdot 100 = 9900
     \]
   - Adding \(1\) to this result:
     \[
     9900 + 1 = 9901
     \]

4. **Alternative verification**:
   - Directly adding \(99\) to \(9801\):
     \[
     9801 + 99 = 9900
     \]
   - Then adding \(1\):
     \[
     9900 + 1 = 9901
     \]

All methods confirm the result is \(9901\).

\[
\boxed{9901}
