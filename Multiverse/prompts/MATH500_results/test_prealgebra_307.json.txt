Okay, so I have this problem here: You have 5 shirts, 6 pairs of pants, and 8 hats. How many outfits can you make consisting of one shirt, one pair of pants, and one hat? Hmm, alright. Let me think about how to approach this.
First off, it's a combinatorics problem, right? I need to figure out the number of possible combinations of shirts, pants, and hats. Each outfit requires one of each item. So, the key concept here is the multiplication principle. If I remember correctly, the multiplication principle states that if there are m ways to do one thing and n ways to do another, then there are m times n ways to do both. Extending this to three items, it should be the product of the number of choices for each item.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: Determine the number of shirt options.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: Determine the number of pants options.
</Outline>
<Outline>
3: Determine the number of hat options.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The number of shirt options available is 5.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The number of pants options is 6.
</Path>
<Path>
3: The number of hat options available is 8.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The available options are 5 shirts, 6 pairs of pants, and 8 hats.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So, the total number of outfits would be 5 multiplied by 6 multiplied by 8. Let me confirm this. Each shirt can be paired with any pair of pants and any hat. So for each shirt, there are 6 pants, and for each combination of shirt and pants, there are 8 hats. Therefore, multiplying all these together gives the total number of possible outfits.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: The product of the number of shirt options and the number of pants options.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: The product of the intermediate result from the first multiplication and the number of hat options.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The multiplication of 5 shirts by 6 pairs of pants yields an intermediate result of 30.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The result from the first multiplication, 30, is multiplied by the number of hat options, 8, yielding 240.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The multiplication of the 5 shirt options by the 6 pants options results in 30. Subsequently, multiplying this intermediate value of 30 by the 8 hat options gives a final total of 240.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So, 240 different outfits. Does that make sense? Let me verify. If I imagine lining up shirts, pants, and hats, for each shirt, each pant, each hat would indeed create a unique combination. Another way to think about it: the number of choices for each item is independent of the others. So, it's a straightforward multiplication. No restrictions mentioned here, like certain shirts not matching with certain pants or anything. So, all combinations are allowed. Therefore, multiplication is correct.
Is there another way to check this? Let's break it down. If I first combine shirts and pants: 5 shirts and 6 pants would make 5*6=30 different combinations. Then, if each of those combinations can be paired with any of the 8 hats, then each of those 30 combinations becomes 30*8=240. Yep, that's the same result.
Alternatively, if I consider pairing pants and hats first: 6*8=48 combinations, then multiplying by 5 shirts gives 240 again. So regardless of the order in which I multiply the numbers, the result is the same because multiplication is commutative and associative. So, 5*6*8=240. Therefore, I'm confident the answer is 240.
**Final Answer**
\boxed{240}
</Think>

Answer: To determine the number of possible outfits consisting of one shirt, one pair of pants, and one hat, we use the multiplication principle. This principle states that if there are multiple independent choices to be made, the total number of combinations is the product of the number of options for each choice.

Given:
- 5 shirts
- 6 pairs of pants
- 8 hats

We calculate the total number of outfits by multiplying the number of choices for each item:

1. First, calculate the number of combinations of shirts and pants: \(5 \text{ shirts} \times 6 \text{ pairs of pants} = 30\) combinations.
2. Then, each of these combinations can be paired with any of the 8 hats: \(30 \times 8 \text{ hats} = 240\).

Thus, the total number of possible outfits is:

\[
5 \times 6 \times 8 = 240
\]

The final answer is \(\boxed{240}\).
