Okay, so I need to find the last nonzero digit to the right of the decimal point in the decimal expansion of 137 divided by 500.
Hmm, let's see.
First, maybe I should convert the fraction into a decimal to see what it looks like.
But before I do that, I remember that fractions with denominators that are factors of 10^n will have decimal expansions that terminate.
Since 500 is 5^3 * 2^2, which is a factor of 10^3, because 10^3 is 1000, which is 5^3 * 2^3.
So, 500 divides into 1000 evenly, meaning this fraction can be expressed as a decimal with three decimal places.
So, maybe multiplying numerator and denominator by 2 to get 1000 in the denominator?
Let's try that.
Multiplying numerator and denominator by 2 gives me (137*2)/(500*2) = 274/1000.
Wait, that's 0.274.
So, is 0.274 the decimal expansion?
Let me confirm that.
137 divided by 500.
Let's think in parallel.

2: The multiplication of 500 by 2 results in 1000.

<Conclusion>
The multiplication of 137 by 2 results in 274, and the multiplication of 500 by 2 results in 1000.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So, 137/500 = 274/1000 = 0.274.
But let's verify that.
Let's do the division manually.
500 goes into 137 zero times.
Wait, actually, 137/500 as a decimal.
Let me set up the division.
137 divided by 500.
Since 500 is larger than 137, the integer part is 0.
Let me add decimal places.
137.000 divided by 500.
500 goes into 1370 two times because 500*2=1000, which is less than 1370.
Subtract 1000 from 1370, which leaves 370.
Bring down the next 0, making it 3700.
500 goes into 3700 seven times because 500*7=3500.
Subtract 3500 from 3700, which leaves 200.
Bring down the next 0, making it 2000.
500 goes into 2000 four times exactly, as 500*4=2000.
So, subtract 2000 from 2000, which leaves 0.
So, the decimal expansion is 0.274.
So, 0.274.
So, the digits to the right of the decimal point are 2, 7, 4.
So, the last nonzero digit would be 4, since 4 is the third decimal place and it's nonzero.
But wait, the question says "the last nonzero digit to the right of the decimal point".
In 0.274, the digits to the right are 2, 7, 4.
All three are nonzero.
So the last one is 4.
So is that the answer?
But maybe I need to check if there are any trailing zeros after 4?
But in this case, the decimal expansion terminates at 4; there are no more digits after that.
So since 137/500 is exactly 0.274, with no repeating decimals, just terminating.
So the last digit is 4, which is nonzero.
So the answer is 4?
But let me make sure.
Let's think in parallel.

1: The division of 137 by 500 is performed manually. The first step involves determining how many times 500 divides into 1370, the first three digits of the dividend. The calculation 500 * 2 = 1000 shows that 500 divides into 1370 two times. Subtracting 1000 from 1370 yields a remainder of 370. Bringing down the next 0 results in a dividend of 3700. The calculation 500 * 7 = 3500 shows that 500 divides into 3700 seven times. Subtracting 3500 from 3700 leaves a remainder of 200. Bringing down the next 0 results in a dividend of 2000. The calculation 500 * 4 = 2000 shows that 500 divides into 2000 four times. Subtracting 2000 from 2000 leaves a remainder of 0. The resulting decimal expansion is 0.274.

The decimal expansion of 137/500 is 0.274, as determined both by manual division and by converting the fraction to 274/1000 through multiplication of the numerator and denominator by 2.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So the decimal expansion is 0.274.
So the digits to the right of the decimal point are 2, 7, 4.
So the last nonzero digit is 4.
So maybe the answer is 4.
But wait, the problem says "last nonzero digit to the right of the decimal point".
So if there were any trailing zeros after 4, then the last nonzero would be before that, but since there are no more digits after 4, then 4 is the last nonzero.
So yes, I think the answer is 4.
Wait, but let me check with another method.
Alternatively, maybe multiplying 137/500 by 10^n and seeing where the nonzero digit is.
Let's see.

The decimal representation of 137/500 is 0.274, as confirmed by both multiplying 137 by 1/500 and converting the fraction to 274/1000.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So 0.274.
So, as the decimal expansion is finite, with three decimal places, and the last digit is 4, which is nonzero.
Therefore, the last nonzero digit to the right of the decimal point is 4.
Hence, the answer is 4.
Hmm.
Wait, but another way: sometimes when you have a decimal like 0.274, which is equivalent to 0.2740 or 0.27400, etc.
Wait, no, actually, once it's exact, you can't add zeros.
If the decimal is exact, then you don't add zeros.
So 0.274 is the exact value, so there are no more digits after that.
So the last digit is 4, so 4 is the last nonzero digit.
Therefore, I think the answer is 4.
But wait, let me check with another example.
Let's say if I had 0.125.
The last nonzero digit is 5, even though 0.125 is 1/8.
So that's correct, the last nonzero is 5.
Similarly, if you have a terminating decimal, the last digit is the last nonzero.
So in this case, 0.274, the last digit is 4, so it should be the answer.
Wait, but maybe the question is in another context, like in another base?
No, the problem doesn't specify, so probably base 10.
Alright, so I think my reasoning is correct.
The decimal expansion is 0.274, so the last nonzero digit is 4.
the final answer is 4

Answer: To solve the problem of finding the last nonzero digit to the right of the decimal point for the fraction \( \frac{137}{500} \):

1. Convert the fraction to a decimal by performing the division \( 137 \div 500 \):
   - Since 500 goes into 137 zero times, we consider 137.000 divided by 500.
   - 500 goes into 1370 two times (1000), leaving a remainder of 370.
   - Bring down the next 0, making it 300 goes into 3700 seven times (3500), leaving a remainder of 200.
   - Bring down the next 0, making it 500 goes into 2000 four times (2000), leaving no remainder.
   - The result is the decimal 0.274.

2. Verify the decimal conversion by multiplying the numerator and denominator by 2 to get a denominator of 1000:
   - \( \frac{137 \times 2}{500 \times 2} = \frac{274}{1000} = 0.274 \).

3. Identify the last nonzero digit to the right of the decimal point in 0.274:
   - The decimal 0.274 has three digits to the right of the decimal point: 2, 7, and 4.
   - All three digits are nonzero, so the last nonzero digit is 4.

Thus, the last nonzero digit to the right of the decimal point for \( \frac{137}{500} \) is \(\boxed{4}\).

the final answer is 4
