Okay, so I need to compute the sum 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - ... + 99 - 100. Let me try to figure out how to approach this. First, I notice that the series alternates between addition and subtraction. The pattern is that each even term is subtracted, and each odd term is added. So, the positive terms are the odd numbers (1, 3, 5, ..., 99) and the negative terms are the even numbers (2, 4, 6, ..., 100). Maybe I can split the sum into two separate sums: one for the positive terms and one for the negative terms. Then, compute each sum and combine them. Let me try that. First, the positive terms: 1, 3, 5, ..., 99. That's the sequence of odd numbers starting at 1 up to 99. How many terms are there? Since the nth odd number is given by the formula 2n - 1. So, if 2n - 1 = 99, then 2n = 100, so n = 50. So, there are 50 positive terms. The sum of the first n odd numbers is n^2. Wait, so the sum of 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + 99 should be 50^2 = 2500. Let me confirm that. The formula for the sum of the first n odd numbers is n^2, which is 50^2 = 2500. Okay, so the positive sum is 2500. Now, the negative terms: -2 -4 -6 - ... -100. That's the sequence of even numbers from -2 to -100. Let's think of this as -1*(2 + 4 + 6 + ... + 100). So, if I can compute the sum inside the parentheses and then multiply by -1. The sum of even numbers from 2 to 100. The number of terms here is (100 - 2)/2 + 1. Wait, the formula for the number of terms when counting by 2s is (last - first)/step + 1. So (100 - 2)/2 +1 = 98/2 +1 = 49 +1 = 50. So, 50 terms. Alternatively, since the nth even number is 2n. So, 2n = 100 when n=50. So, yeah, 50 terms. The sum of the first n even numbers is n(n + 1). But wait, the formula for the sum of the first n even numbers is n(n + 1). Let me recall that. Yes, the sum of the first n even numbers is n(n + 1). For example, n=1: 2 = 1*2=2, n=2: 2+4=6=2*3=6. So, sum of 2 + 4 + 6 + ... + 100 would be 50*(50 +1) = 50*51 = 2550. Therefore, the negative terms sum to -2550. Therefore, the total sum is 2500 - 2550 = -50. Wait, so the answer would be -50? Hmm, let me check again. Wait, sum of positive terms (odds): 1, 3, 5,...,99 is 2500. Sum of negative terms (even numbers): -2, -4,...,-100, which is -2550. So total sum is 2500 - 2550 = -50. But that seems counter-intuitive because we have more positive terms? Wait, no. Wait, hold on. Wait, actually, the number of positive terms and negative terms is the same? Let's check. The positive terms go 1,3,5,...,99. That's the odd numbers up to 99. Since 99 is the 50th odd number, so 50 terms. The negative terms are 2,4,6,...,100. Which is the even numbers up to 100. The nth even number is 2n, so 100 is the 50th even number. So, 50 terms as well. So, equal number of positive and negative terms. So, if their sums are 2500 and 2550, then the total is 2500 - 2550 = -50. Hmm, but 2500 minus 2550 is indeed -50. Let's think in parallel.

1: The problem can be approached by pairing consecutive terms: (1-2) + (3-4) + ... + (99-100). Each such pair (n - (n+1)) evaluates to -1. The number of these pairs is determined by the total count of terms. The original series starts at 1 and ends at 100, containing 100 terms in total. Since each pair consists of two terms, the number of pairs is 100 divided by 2, which equals 50. Each of these 50 pairs sums to -1, so their combined total is 50 multiplied by -1, resulting in -50. This result suggests the final sum of the series is -50.

2: The entire series is 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + ... + 99 - 100. This can be grouped as (1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + ... + (99 - 100), resulting in the sum of 50 identical pairs, each equaling -1. The total sum is 50 * (-1) = -50.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
Both the pairing method, which yields 50 pairs each summing to -1 (total -50), and the direct arithmetic sum of the entire series, which also yields -50, consistently indicate that the total sum is -50.

Wait, maybe that's a better way. If you pair them as (1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + ... + (99 - 100). Each pair is -1 and there are 50 pairs. So total is -50. That's straightforward. So why did the other method give the same answer? Wait, but in that case, if the sum is -50, then that conflicts with my initial feeling that there are more positives? But no, the number of positive and negative numbers is the same. Since starting at 1 up to 100, there's 100 numbers. Grouped as 1-2, 3-4, ..., 99-100. So 100 numbers divided into 50 groups, each contributing -1. So total -50. That seems correct. Alternatively, thinking that each pair is (odd - (odd +1)) = -1. So 1 to 100, 50 pairs, each contributing -1. So total sum is -50. So that seems clear. But let me check why the sum of odds is 2500 and evens 2550. If you take the positive terms: 1,3,5,...,99. Sum of the first n odd numbers is n^2. Here, n=50, so 50^2=2500. The sum of the negative terms: 2,4,6,...,100. The sum of the first m even numbers is m(m +1). Here, 2+4+...+100: the nth even number is 2n, so 100 is the 50th even number, so m=50. So sum is 50*(50 +1) = 50*51=2550. So total sum is 2500 -2550 = -50. So that's correct as well. So both approaches confirm that the answer is -50. So I think that's correct. Alternatively, if I write it out for a smaller number. Let's say up to 2 terms: 1-2= -1. According to the formula, (1 odd term: 1) summed as 1, and (1 even term: 2) summed as -2. Total:1 -2 = -1. Which matches (1 -2) = -1. Similarly, 1 -2 +3 -4. Which is (1-2)+(3-4)= -1 -1= -2. The formula approach: sum of odds 1,3=4 (but 2^2=4), sum of evens 2,4=6. So 4 -6= -2. Which matches. Another example: 1 -2 +3 -4 +5 -6. Grouped: (1-2)+(3-4)+(5-6)= -1 -1 -1= -3. Formula: sum of odds 1,3,5=9 (3^2=9), sum of evens 2,4,6=12. Then 9 -12= -3. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for 1-2+3-4+...+99-100, the formula gives 2500 -2550= -50. The pairing method gives 50 * (-1) = -50. Both methods agree. So the answer is -50. Therefore, confident that the answer is -50.
**Final Answer** 
\boxed{-50}
</Think>

Answer: To compute the sum \(1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - \dots + 99 - 100\), we can observe that the series alternates between addition and subtraction. This can be approached by pairing consecutive terms or by separating the positive and negative terms.

### Pairing Consecutive Terms
Pairing the terms as \((1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + \dots + (99 - 100)\):
- Each pair sums to \(-1\).
- There are 50 such pairs (since there are 100 terms in total).

Thus, the total sum is:
\[
50 \times (-1) = -50
\]

### Separating Positive and Negative Terms
- The positive terms are the odd numbers: \(1, 3, 5, \ldots, 99\). There are 50 terms, and their sum is \(50^2 = 2500\).
- The negative terms are the even numbers: \(2, 4, 6, \ldots, 100\). There are 50 terms, and their sum is \(50 \times 51 = 2550\).

Combining these results:
\[
2500 - 2550 = -50
\]

Both methods confirm the result. Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{-50}
\]
