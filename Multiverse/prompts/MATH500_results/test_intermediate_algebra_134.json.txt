Okay, let's see here. I need to compute the sum 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - ... + 99 - 100. Hmm, okay. First, I should look for a pattern or a way to group the terms to make the calculation easier.
Let's think in parallel.

1: The series exhibits an alternating pattern of addition and subtraction.

2: The terms can be paired as (1-2)+(3-4)+(5-6)+...+(99-100). Each such pair simplifies to -1.

<Conclusion>
The series is characterized by an alternating addition and subtraction pattern, which suggests grouping the terms into pairs.

Let me verify that. Take the first pair: 1 - 2 = -1. Next pair: 3 - 4 = -1. Similarly, 5 - 6 = -1, and so on until 99 - 100 = -1. So each of these pairs adds up to -1. Therefore, all I need to do is figure out how many such pairs there are and then multiply that by -1.
The total number of terms in the sequence is 100. Since each pair consists of 2 terms, the number of pairs would be 100 divided by 2, which is 50. Therefore, there are 50 pairs, each contributing -1 to the sum. So the total sum should be 50 * (-1) = -50.
But let me double-check. Let's take a small example. Suppose we have 1 - 2 + 3 - 4. That should be (1 - 2) + (3 - 4) = -1 + -1 = -2. Which is indeed -2. So 2 pairs, each contributing -1, total sum -2. So that works.
Let's think in parallel.

</Path>

2: An initial consideration of an odd number of terms, such as 1-2+3-4+5, is dismissed because the problem involves 100 terms.

The pairing strategy is validated for an even number of terms, and an odd-numbered case is deemed irrelevant to the problem.

Wait, another way: The sum can be written as sum_{k=1}^{100} (-1)^{k+1} k. But perhaps that's more complicated. Alternatively, the sum can be grouped as pairs of (positive - negative). Each pair is an odd term (positive) and an even term (negative). Since we start at 1 (positive) and end at 100 (negative), which is even. So there's no term left unpaired. Hence, 50 pairs, each equaling -1, total sum -50.
But wait, hold on. Let me make sure about the number of pairs. If we start at 1 and go up to 100, that's 100 numbers. First number is 1, last number is 100. Since we are pairing them as (1-2), (3-4), ..., (99-100). The first term of each pair is an odd number, and the second term is the next even number. So the number of pairs is equal to the number of odd numbers in the list. Wait, from 1 to 99, how many odd numbers are there? 1, 3, 5, ..., 99. That's an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2. The number of terms can be calculated as (99 -1)/2 +1 = 49 +1 =50. So yes, 50 pairs. Therefore, 50 pairs times -1 each equals -50.
Alternatively, if I'm still not sure, maybe I can think of it as the sum of all the positive terms minus the sum of all the negative terms. The positive terms are the odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, ..., 99. The negative terms are the even numbers: 2, 4, 6, ..., 100.
So the total sum would be (Sum of odds) - (Sum of evens). Let's compute each sum separately. First, sum of odds: 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + 99. That's an arithmetic series with first term a=1, common difference d=2, last term l=99. The number of terms n can be found by nth term = a + (n-1)d. So 99 =1 + (n -1)*2 => 98 = (n -1)*2 => 49 = n -1 => n=50. So there are 50 terms. The sum is n/2 * (first term + last term) = 50/2 * (1 + 99) = 25 * 100 = 2500.
Wait, that seems high. Wait, hold on. Wait, the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is n/2*(first term + last term). So n is 50 terms. 50/2 is 25. 25 times (1 +99) is 25*100=2500. But that can't be right. Wait, sum of the first 50 odd numbers starting at 1 is actually 2500? Wait, but the sum of the first n odd numbers is n^2. Wait, that's a formula. The sum of the first n odd numbers is n^2. So here, the number of terms is 50. So the sum should be 50^2 = 2500? Wait, but that's the sum of 1 to 99 with step 2, i.e., the first 50 odd numbers. So that seems correct. So the sum of the positive terms (odds) is 2500.
Let's think in parallel.

<Goal>
<Outline>
1: The sum of the even numbers from 2 to 100.

<Outline>
2: The sum of the negative terms (even numbers) in the series.

<Path>
1: The sum of the even numbers from 2 to 100 is considered.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The sum of the negative terms is the negative of the sum of the even numbers from 2 to 100, which is -2550.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The sum of the even numbers from 2 to 100 is 2550, and consequently, the sum of the negative terms (even numbers) in the series is -2550.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Therefore, total sum is 2500 - 2550 = -50. Yep, same answer. So regardless of grouping or separate summation, the answer is -50. Alternatively, another way to think about it is pairing each odd and even. Let's think of the entire sum as (1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + ... + (99 -100). Each pair is -1 as before, 50 pairs, total -50.
I think this problem is a basic example of telescoping series or grouping terms with alternate signs. The key is recognizing the pattern and correctly counting the number of pairs. Since 100 terms means 50 pairs, and each pair sums to -1, so total is -50. Alternatively, if someone thought there are 100 pairs, they'd be wrong, but the number of pairs is 100 terms divided by 2 terms per pair, which is 50. So that's correct.
Wait, another sanity check. Let me compute a smaller example. Say, up to 4 terms: 1 - 2 + 3 - 4. Which is (1 -2) + (3 -4) = (-1) + (-1) = -2. Which is 2 pairs, so 2 * (-1) = -2. Alternatively, sum of odds:1 +3=4, sum of evens:2 +4=6. Then 4 -6= -2. Same. So that works. Another example: 1 -2 +3 -4 +5 -6. That's three pairs: (1-2) + (3-4) + (5-6) = -1 -1 -1 = -3. Alternatively, sum of odds:1+3+5=9, sum of evens:2+4+6=12. 9 -12= -3. Correct. So generalizing, if there are n pairs (i.e., 2n terms total), the sum is -n. So in our original problem, 100 terms mean 50 pairs, so sum is -50. Perfect. So yeah, all these methods confirm that the answer is -50. So I'm confident with that.
**Final Answer**
\boxed{-50}
</Think>

Answer: To compute the sum \(1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - \dots + 99 - 100\), we observe that the terms can be grouped into pairs of the form \((1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + (5 - 6) + \dots + (99 - 100)\). Each pair simplifies to \(-1\).

1. **Grouping into Pairs**:
   - Each pair \((2k - 1) - 2k\) simplifies to \(-1\).
   - Examples: \(1 - 2 = -1\), \(3 - 4 = -1\), etc.

2. **Counting the Pairs**:
   - Total number of terms: 100.
   - Each pair consists of 2 terms, so the number of pairs is \(100 / 2 = 50\).

3. **Summing the Pairs**:
   - Each of the 50 pairs contributes \(-1\).
   - Total sum: \(50 \times (-1) = -50\).

4. **Verification by Separating Positive and Negative Terms**:
   - **Positive terms (odds)**: \(1, 3, 5, \ldots, 99\)
     - Number of terms: \(50\)
     - Sum: \(\frac{50}{2} \times (1 + 99) = 25 \times 100 = 2500\)
   - **Negative terms (evens)**: \(2, 4, 6, \ldots, 100\)
     - Number of terms: \(50\)
     - Sum: \(\frac{50}{2} \times (2 + 100) = 25 \times 102 = 2550\)
   - Total sum: \(2500 - 2550 = -50\).

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{-50}\).
