Okay, let's try to solve this problem. We need to find the value of x531 + x753 + x975 given the initial terms x1 = 211, x2 = 375, x3 = 420, x4 = 523, and the recurrence relation xn = xn−1 − xn−2 + xn−3 − xn−4 for n ≥ 5.
Hmm, that recurrence relation looks a bit complex, but maybe we can find a pattern or a cycle in the sequence. Since the recurrence involves four previous terms, cycles might have a period that's a multiple of 4. Let me compute some terms and see if a pattern emerges.
Let's compute x5 first. According to the formula, x5 = x4 − x3 + x2 − x1. Plugging in the numbers:
x5 = 523 − 420 + 375 − 211.
Let me calculate that step by step. 523 − 420 is 103. Then 103 + 375 is 478. Then 478 − 211 is 267. So x5 = 267.
Now, x6 = x5 − x4 + x3 − x2. So that's 267 − 523 + 420 − 375.
Let's compute this. 267 − 523 is -256. Then -256 + 420 is 164. Then 164 − 375 is -211. So x6 = -211.
Moving on, x7 = x6 − x5 + x4 − x3. So: -211 − 267 + 523 − 420.
First, -211 − 267 is -478. Then -478 + 523 is 45. Then 45 − 420 is -375. So x7 = -375.
Next, x8 = x7 − x6 + x5 − x4. Let's compute: -375 − (-211) + 267 − 523.
Simplify step by step: -375 + 211 is -164. Then -164 + 267 is 103. Then 103 − 523 is -420. So x8 = -420.
x9 = x8 − x7 + x6 − x5. So: -420 − (-375) + (-211) − 267.
Calculating: -420 + 375 is -45. Then -45 − 211 is -256. Then -256 − 267 is -523. So x9 = -523.
x10 = x9 − x8 + x7 − x6. That's -523 − (-420) + (-375) − (-211).
Let's compute step by step: -523 + 420 is -103. Then -103 − 375 is -478. Then -478 + 211 is -267. So x10 = -267.
x11 = x10 − x9 + x8 − x7. So: -267 − (-523) + (-420) − (-375).
Breaking down: -267 + 523 is 256. Then 256 − 420 is -164. Then -164 + 375 is 211. So x11 = 211.
Wait a minute, x11 = 211, which is the same as x1. Let's see if the next term continues the cycle.
x12 = x11 − x10 + x9 − x8. So: 211 − (-267) + (-523) − (-420).
Calculating: 211 + 267 is 478. Then 478 − 523 is -45. Then -45 + 420 is 375. So x12 = 375, which is x2.
Hmm, interesting. Then x13 should be x3, and so on. Let's check.
x13 = x12 − x11 + x10 − x9. So 375 − 211 + (-267) − (-523).
Compute: 375 − 211 is 164. 164 − 267 is -103. -103 + 523 is 420. So x13 = 420, which is x3.
Similarly, x14 = x13 − x12 + x11 − x10. So 420 − 375 + 211 − (-267).
Calculate: 420 − 375 = 45. 45 + 211 = 256. 256 + 267 = 523. So x14 = 523, same as x4.
Then x15 should be x5, which was 267. Let me verify:
x15 = x14 − x13 + x12 − x11. So 523 − 420 + 375 − 211. Let's compute: 523 − 420 = 103. 103 + 375 = 478. 478 − 211 = 267. So x15 = 267, same as x5.
Therefore, the sequence repeats every 10 terms. Let's confirm this by checking x16 to x20.
x16: x15 − x14 + x13 − x12 = 267 − 523 + 420 − 375. Compute: 267 − 523 = -256. -256 + 420 = 164. 164 − 375 = -211. So x16 = -211, same as x6.
Similarly, x17 = x16 − x15 + x14 − x13 = -211 − 267 + 523 − 420. Compute: -211 − 267 = -478. -478 + 523 = 45. 45 − 420 = -375. So x17 = -375, same as x7.
Continuing this way, x18 = -420 (same as x8), x19 = -523 (same as x9), x20 = -267 (same as x10).
Then x21 = 211 (same as x11), so the cycle indeed repeats every 10 terms. Therefore, the sequence has a period of 10.
Therefore, to find x531, x753, and x975, we can compute the remainder of 531, 753, and 975 divided by 10, since the sequence repeats every 10 terms.
Let's compute these remainders:
531 divided by 10 gives remainder 1. So x531 = x1 = 211.
753 divided by 10 gives remainder 3. So x753 = x3 = 420.
975 divided by 10 gives remainder 5. So x975 = x5 = 267.
Wait, hold on. The period is 10, so the sequence repeats every 10 terms. So for n ≡ k mod 10, xn = xk. However, let's check for n=11, which is x11, which is 211, same as x1. Similarly, n=13 is x13 = 420, same as x3. So indeed, if n ≡ k mod 10, then xn = xk. Therefore, 531 mod 10 is 1, so x531 = x1 = 211. 753 mod 10 is 3, so x753 = x3 = 420. 975 mod 10 is 5, so x975 = x5 = 267.
Therefore, the sum is 211 + 420 + 267. Let's compute that: 211 + 420 = 631. 631 + 267 = 898.
But hold on, is that correct? Wait, when I checked earlier, x11 was indeed x1, x13 was x3, so yes, the cycle is 10 terms. Therefore, the remainder when dividing by 10 gives the corresponding term in the cycle. So 531 mod 10 is 1 ⇒ x531 = x1, 753 mod 10 is 3 ⇒ x753 = x3, 975 mod 10 is 5 ⇒ x975 = x5. So adding them up: 211 + 420 + 267 = 898. Is that the correct answer?
But let me verify once more. Let's list the first 14 terms to confirm the cycle:
x1: 211
x2: 375
x3: 420
x4: 523
x5: 267
x6: -211
x7: -375
x8: -420
x9: -523
x10: -267
x11: 211
x12: 375
x13: 420
x14: 523
So starting from x1 to x10, then x11 onwards it repeats. So the cycle is indeed 10 terms. Therefore, the nth term depends on n mod 10. If n mod 10 is 1, it's 211; if 2, 375; 3, 420; 4, 523; 5, 267; 6, -211; 7, -375; 8, -420; 9, -523; 10, -267.
Then when n is 531, 531 divided by 10 is 53 with remainder 1, so x531 = x1 = 211.
Similarly, 753 divided by 10 is 75 with remainder 3, so x753 = x3 = 420.
975 divided by 10 is 97 with remainder 5, so x975 = x5 = 267.
Adding them: 211 + 420 + 267 = 211 + 420 is 631, 631 + 267 is 898.
But let me just check one more time. Maybe I miscalculated the recurrence. Let me verify x5 again.
x5 = x4 - x3 + x2 - x1 = 523 - 420 + 375 - 211. Let's compute 523 - 420: 523 - 400 = 123, then -20 more: 103. So 103 + 375 = 478. 478 - 211 = 267. Correct. So x5 is 267.
Similarly, x6 = x5 - x4 + x3 - x2 = 267 - 523 + 420 - 375. 267 - 523: 267 - 500 = -233, then +20 more => -213. -213 + 420 = 207. 207 - 375 = -168. Wait, no, that doesn't match my previous calculation. Wait, earlier I got x6 = -211, but now I got -168? Wait, something's wrong here.
Wait, no, earlier steps:
x6 = x5 - x4 + x3 - x2 = 267 - 523 + 420 - 375.
Let me compute step by step:
First term: 267.
Subtract 523: 267 - 523 = -256.
Add 420: -256 + 420 = 164.
Subtract 375: 164 - 375 = -211. So x6 = -211. That's correct. So previous calculation was right.
So x6 is -211. Then x7 is x6 - x5 + x4 - x3 = -211 - 267 + 523 - 420.
Compute step by step:
Start with -211.
Subtract 267: -211 - 267 = -478.
Add 523: -478 + 523 = 45.
Subtract 420: 45 - 420 = -375. So x7 = -375. Correct.
Then x8 is x7 - x6 + x5 - x4 = -375 - (-211) + 267 - 523.
Which is -375 + 211 + 267 - 523.
Breaking down:
-375 + 211 = -164.
-164 + 267 = 103.
103 - 523 = -420. So x8 = -420. Correct.
x9 = x8 - x7 + x6 - x5 = -420 - (-375) + (-211) - 267.
Which is -420 + 375 - 211 - 267.
Step by step:
-420 + 375 = -45.
-45 -211 = -256.
-256 -267 = -523. So x9 = -523. Correct.
x10 = x9 - x8 + x7 - x6 = -523 - (-420) + (-375) - (-211).
So -523 + 420 - 375 + 211.
Calculate:
-523 + 420 = -103.
-103 - 375 = -478.
-478 + 211 = -267. So x10 = -267. Correct.
x11 = x10 - x9 + x8 - x7 = -267 - (-523) + (-420) - (-375).
So -267 + 523 - 420 + 375.
Breaking down:
-267 + 523 = 256.
256 - 420 = -164.
-164 + 375 = 211. So x11 = 211. Correct.
x12 = x11 - x10 + x9 - x8 = 211 - (-267) + (-523) - (-420).
Which is 211 + 267 - 523 + 420.
Calculating:
211 + 267 = 478.
478 - 523 = -45.
-45 + 420 = 375. So x12 = 375. Correct.
Therefore, the cycle is indeed 10 terms. Thus, the sequence repeats every 10 terms. So the nth term is equal to the (n mod 10)th term. Unless n mod 10 is zero, in which case it's x10.
But since 531 mod 10 is 1, 753 mod 10 is 3, and 975 mod 10 is 5, the values are x1, x3, x5. Therefore, sum is 211 + 420 + 267 = 898. Therefore, the answer is 898.
Wait, but let me check once more. Maybe I missed a carryover in addition. Let's compute 211 + 420 + 267.
211 + 420: 200 + 400 = 600, 11 + 20 = 31, total 631.
631 + 267: 600 + 200 = 800, 31 + 67 = 98, total 898. Yes. Correct.
Therefore, the final answer is 898.
**Final Answer**
\boxed{898}
</Think>

Answer: Given the sequence defined by:
\[
\begin{align*}
x_{1} &= 211, \\
x_{2} &= 375, \\
x_{3} &= 420, \\
x_{4} &= 523, \\
x_{n} &= x_{n-1} - x_{n-2} + x_{n-3} - x_{n-4} \quad \text{for } n \geq 5,
\end{align*}
\]
we need to find the value of \(x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975}\).

First, we compute the initial terms to identify any patterns:
\[
\begin{align*}
x_{5} &= x_{4} - x_{3} + x_{2} - x_{1} = 523 - 420 + 375 - 211 = 267, \\
x_{6} &= x_{5} - x_{4} + x_{3} - x_{2} = 267 - 523 + 420 - 375 = -211, \\
x_{7} &= x_{6} - x_{5} + x_{4} - x_{3} = -211 - 267 + 523 - 420 = -375, \\
x_{8} &= x_{7} - x_{6} + x_{5} - x_{4} = -375 - (-211) + 267 - 523 = -420, \\
x_{9} &= x_{8} - x_{7} + x_{6} - x_{5} = -420 - (-375) + (-211) - 267 = -523, \\
x_{10} &= x_{9} - x_{8} + x_{7} - x_{6} = -523 - (-420) + (-375) - (-211) = -267, \\
x_{11} &= x_{10} - x_{9} + x_{8} - x_{7} = -267 - (-523) + (-420) - (-375) = 211, \\
x_{12} &= x_{11} - x_{10} + x_{9} - x_{8} = 211 - (-267) + (-523) - (-420) = 375.
\end{align*}
\]

Observing that \(x_{11} = x_{1}\) and \(x_{12} = x_{2}\), we conclude the sequence is periodic with a period of 10. Therefore, the terms repeat every 10 indices.

To find \(x_{531}\), \(x_{753}\), and \(x_{975}\), we compute the remainders of 531, 753, and 975 when divided by 10:
\[
\begin{align*}
531 \mod 10 & = 1 \implies x_{531} = x_{1} = 211, \\
753 \mod 10 & = 3 \implies x_{753} = x_{3} = 420, \\
975 \mod 10 & = 5 \implies x_{975} = x_{5} = 267.
\end{align*}
\]

Summing these values:
\[
x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975} = 211 + 420 + 267 = 898.
\]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{898}
\]

okay, let's try to solve this problem. we need to find the value of x531 + x753 + x975 given the initial terms x1 = 211, x2 = 375, x3 = 420, x4 = 523, and the recurrence relation xn = xn−1 − xn−2 + xn−3 − xn−4 for n ≥ 5.
hmm, that recurrence relation looks a bit complex, but maybe we can find a pattern or a cycle in the sequence. since the recurrence involves four previous terms, cycles might have a period that's a multiple of 4. let me compute some terms and see if a pattern emerges.
let's compute x5 first. according to the formula, x5 = x4 − x3 + x2 − x1. plugging in the numbers:
x5 = 523 − 420 + 375 − 211.
let me calculate that step by step. 523 − 420 is 103. then 103 + 375 is 478. then 478 − 211 is 267. so x5 = 267.
now, x6 = x5 − x4 + x3 − x2. so that's 267 − 523 + 420 − 375.
let's compute this. 267 − 523 is -256. then -256 + 420 is 164. then 164 − 375 is -211. so x6 = -211.
moving on, x7 = x6 − x5 + x4 − x3. so: -211 − 267 + 523 − 420.
first, -211 − 267 is -478. then -478 + 523 is 45. then 45 − 420 is -375. so x7 = -375.
next, x8 = x7 − x6 + x5 − x4. let's compute: -375 − (-211) + 267 − 523.
simplify step by step: -375 + 211 is -164. then -164 + 267 is 103. then 103 − 523 is -420. so x8 = -420.
x9 = x8 − x7 + x6 − x5. so: -420 − (-375) + (-211) − 267.
calculating: -420 + 375 is -45. then -45 − 211 is -256. then -256 − 267 is -523. so x9 = -523.
x10 = x9 − x8 + x7 − x6. that's -523 − (-420) + (-375) − (-211).
let's compute step by step: -523 + 420 is -103. then -103 − 375 is -478. then -478 + 211 is -267. so x10 = -267.
x11 = x10 − x9 + x8 − x7. so: -267 − (-523) + (-420) − (-375).
breaking down: -267 + 523 is 256. then 256 − 420 is -164. then -164 + 375 is 211. so x11 = 211.
wait a minute, x11 = 211, which is the same as x1. let's see if the next term continues the cycle.
x12 = x11 − x10 + x9 − x8. so: 211 − (-267) + (-523) − (-420).
calculating: 211 + 267 is 478. then 478 − 523 is -45. then -45 + 420 is 375. so x12 = 375, which is x2.
hmm, interesting. then x13 should be x3, and so on. let's check.
x13 = x12 − x11 + x10 − x9. so 375 − 211 + (-267) − (-523).
compute: 375 − 211 is 164. 164 − 267 is -103. -103 + 523 is 420. so x13 = 420, which is x3.
similarly, x14 = x13 − x12 + x11 − x10. so 420 − 375 + 211 − (-267).
calculate: 420 − 375 = 45. 45 + 211 = 256. 256 + 267 = 523. so x14 = 523, same as x4.
then x15 should be x5, which was 267. let me verify:
x15 = x14 − x13 + x12 − x11. so 523 − 420 + 375 − 211. let's compute: 523 − 420 = 103. 103 + 375 = 478. 478 − 211 = 267. so x15 = 267, same as x5.
therefore, the sequence repeats every 10 terms. let's confirm this by checking x16 to x20.
x16: x15 − x14 + x13 − x12 = 267 − 523 + 420 − 375. compute: 267 − 523 = -256. -256 + 420 = 164. 164 − 375 = -211. so x16 = -211, same as x6.
similarly, x17 = x16 − x15 + x14 − x13 = -211 − 267 + 523 − 420. compute: -211 − 267 = -478. -478 + 523 = 45. 45 − 420 = -375. so x17 = -375, same as x7.
continuing this way, x18 = -420 (same as x8), x19 = -523 (same as x9), x20 = -267 (same as x10).
then x21 = 211 (same as x11), so the cycle indeed repeats every 10 terms. therefore, the sequence has a period of 10.
therefore, to find x531, x753, and x975, we can compute the remainder of 531, 753, and 975 divided by 10, since the sequence repeats every 10 terms.
let's compute these remainders:
531 divided by 10 gives remainder 1. so x531 = x1 = 211.
753 divided by 10 gives remainder 3. so x753 = x3 = 420.
975 divided by 10 gives remainder 5. so x975 = x5 = 267.
wait, hold on. the period is 10, so the sequence repeats every 10 terms. so for n ≡ k mod 10, xn = xk. however, let's check for n=11, which is x11, which is 211, same as x1. similarly, n=13 is x13 = 420, same as x3. so indeed, if n ≡ k mod 10, then xn = xk. therefore, 531 mod 10 is 1, so x531 = x1 = 211. 753 mod 10 is 3, so x753 = x3 = 420. 975 mod 10 is 5, so x975 = x5 = 267.
therefore, the sum is 211 + 420 + 267. let's compute that: 211 + 420 = 631. 631 + 267 = 898.
but hold on, is that correct? wait, when i checked earlier, x11 was indeed x1, x13 was x3, so yes, the cycle is 10 terms. therefore, the remainder when dividing by 10 gives the corresponding term in the cycle. so 531 mod 10 is 1 ⇒ x531 = x1, 753 mod 10 is 3 ⇒ x753 = x3, 975 mod 10 is 5 ⇒ x975 = x5. so adding them up: 211 + 420 + 267 = 898. is that the correct answer?
but let me verify once more. let's list the first 14 terms to confirm the cycle:
x1: 211
x2: 375
x3: 420
x4: 523
x5: 267
x6: -211
x7: -375
x8: -420

x10: -267

so starting from x1 to x10, then x11 onwards it repeats. so the cycle is indeed 10 terms. therefore, the nth term depends on n mod 10. if n mod 10 is 1, it's 211; if 2, 375; 3, 420; 4, 523; 5, 267; 6, -211; 7, -375; 8, -420; 9, -523; 10, -267.
then when n is 531, 531 divided by 10 is 53 with remainder 1, so x531 = x1 = 211.
similarly, 753 divided by 10 is 75 with remainder 3, so x753 = x3 = 420.
975 divided by 10 is 97 with remainder 5, so x975 = x5 = 267.
adding them: 211 + 420 + 267 = 211 + 420 is 631, 631 + 267 is 898.
but let me just check one more time. maybe i miscalculated the recurrence. let me verify x5 again.
x5 = x4 - x3 + x2 - x1 = 523 - 420 + 375 - 211. let's compute 523 - 420: 523 - 400 = 123, then -20 more: 103. so 103 + 375 = 478. 478 - 211 = 267. correct. so x5 is 267.
similarly, x6 = x5 - x4 + x3 - x2 = 267 - 523 + 420 - 375. 267 - 523: 267 - 500 = -233, then +20 more => -213. -213 + 420 = 207. 207 - 375 = -168. wait, no, that doesn't match my previous calculation. wait, earlier i got x6 = -211, but now i got -168? wait, something's wrong here.
wait, no, earlier steps:
x6 = x5 - x4 + x3 - x2 = 267 - 523 + 420 - 375.
let me compute step by step:
first term: 267.
subtract 523: 267 - 523 = -256.
add 420: -256 + 420 = 164.
subtract 375: 164 - 375 = -211. so x6 = -211. that's correct. so previous calculation was right.
so x6 is -211. then x7 is x6 - x5 + x4 - x3 = -211 - 267 + 523 - 420.
compute step by step:
start with -211.
subtract 267: -211 - 267 = -478.
add 523: -478 + 523 = 45.
subtract 420: 45 - 420 = -375. so x7 = -375. correct.
then x8 is x7 - x6 + x5 - x4 = -375 - (-211) + 267 - 523.
which is -375 + 211 + 267 - 523.
breaking down:
-375 + 211 = -164.
-164 + 267 = 103.
103 - 523 = -420. so x8 = -420. correct.
x9 = x8 - x7 + x6 - x5 = -420 - (-375) + (-211) - 267.
which is -420 + 375 - 211 - 267.
step by step:
-420 + 375 = -45.
-45 -211 = -256.
-256 -267 = -523. so x9 = -523. correct.
x10 = x9 - x8 + x7 - x6 = -523 - (-420) + (-375) - (-211).
so -523 + 420 - 375 + 211.
calculate:
-523 + 420 = -103.
-103 - 375 = -478.
-478 + 211 = -267. so x10 = -267. correct.
x11 = x10 - x9 + x8 - x7 = -267 - (-523) + (-420) - (-375).
so -267 + 523 - 420 + 375.
breaking down:
-267 + 523 = 256.
256 - 420 = -164.
-164 + 375 = 211. so x11 = 211. correct.
x12 = x11 - x10 + x9 - x8 = 211 - (-267) + (-523) - (-420).
which is 211 + 267 - 523 + 420.
calculating:
211 + 267 = 478.
478 - 523 = -45.
-45 + 420 = 375. so x12 = 375. correct.
therefore, the cycle is indeed 10 terms. thus, the sequence repeats every 10 terms. so the nth term is equal to the (n mod 10)th term. unless n mod 10 is zero, in which case it's x10.
but since 531 mod 10 is 1, 753 mod 10 is 3, and 975 mod 10 is 5, the values are x1, x3, x5. therefore, sum is 211 + 420 + 267 = 898. therefore, the answer is 898.
wait, but let me check once more. maybe i missed a carryover in addition. let's compute 211 + 420 + 267.
211 + 420: 200 + 400 = 600, 11 + 20 = 31, total 631.
631 + 267: 600 + 200 = 800, 31 + 67 = 98, total 898. yes. correct.
therefore, the final answer is 898.
**final answer**
\boxed{898}

answer: given the sequence defined by:
\[
\begin{align*}
x_{1} &= 211, \\
x_{2} &= 375, \\
x_{3} &= 420, \\
x_{4} &= 523, \\
x_{n} &= x_{n-1} - x_{n-2} + x_{n-3} - x_{n-4} \quad \text{for } n \geq 5,
\end{align*}
\]
we need to find the value of \(x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975}\).

first, we compute the initial terms to identify any patterns:
\[
\begin{align*}
x_{5} &= x_{4} - x_{3} + x_{2} - x_{1} = 523 - 420 + 375 - 211 = 267, \\
x_{6} &= x_{5} - x_{4} + x_{3} - x_{2} = 267 - 523 + 420 - 375 = -211, \\
x_{7} &= x_{6} - x_{5} + x_{4} - x_{3} = -211 - 267 + 523 - 420 = -375, \\
x_{8} &= x_{7} - x_{6} + x_{5} - x_{4} = -375 - (-211) + 267 - 523 = -420, \\
x_{9} &= x_{8} - x_{7} + x_{6} - x_{5} = -420 - (-375) + (-211) - 267 = -523, \\
x_{10} &= x_{9} - x_{8} + x_{7} - x_{6} = -523 - (-420) + (-375) - (-211) = -267, \\
x_{11} &= x_{10} - x_{9} + x_{8} - x_{7} = -267 - (-523) + (-420) - (-375) = 211, \\
x_{12} &= x_{11} - x_{10} + x_{9} - x_{8} = 211 - (-267) + (-523) - (-420) = 375.
\end{align*}
\]

observing that \(x_{11} = x_{1}\) and \(x_{12} = x_{2}\), we conclude the sequence is periodic with a period of 10. therefore, the terms repeat every 10 indices.

to find \(x_{531}\), \(x_{753}\), and \(x_{975}\), we compute the remainders of 531, 753, and 975 when divided by 10:
\[
\begin{align*}
531 \mod 10 & = 1 \implies x_{531} = x_{1} = 211, \\
753 \mod 10 & = 3 \implies x_{753} = x_{3} = 420, \\
975 \mod 10 & = 5 \implies x_{975} = x_{5} = 267.
\end{align*}
\]

summing these values:
\[
x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975} = 211 + 420 + 267 = 898.
\]

thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{898}
\]
