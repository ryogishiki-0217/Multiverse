Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step.
So, we're given a sequence where the first four terms are x1 = 211, x2 = 375, x3 = 420, x4 = 523.
For n ≥ 5, each term is defined as xn = xn−1 - xn−2 + xn−3 - xn−4.
We need to find the value of x531 + x753 + x975.
Hmm, that seems like a lot of terms to compute.
Calculating each term up to 531, 753, and 975 would be tedious and time-consuming.
There must be a pattern or periodicity in this sequence that we can exploit.
Let me recall that when sequences are defined by linear recurrence relations with constant coefficients, they often exhibit periodic behavior, especially when the coefficients alternate in sign like here.
First, let me write down the recurrence relation again:
xn = xn−1 - xn−2 + xn−3 - xn−4 for n ≥ 5.
So each term is dependent on the previous four terms with alternating signs.
To figure out if this sequence is periodic, I should compute some terms and see if the sequence repeats.
If it does, we can find the period and then compute the required terms modulo the period to simplify the calculations.
Let me start by calculating the first few terms manually.
We already have:
x1 = 211
x2 = 375
x3 = 420
x4 = 523
Now, let's compute x5:
x5 = x4 - x3 + x2 - x1
= 523 - 420 + 375 - 211
Let me compute that step by step:
523 - 420 = 103
103 + 375 = 478
478 - 211 = 267
So x5 = 267
Next, x6 = x5 - x4 + x3 - x2
= 267 - 523 + 420 - 375
Calculating step by step:
267 - 523 = -256
-256 + 420 = 164
164 - 375 = -211
Hence, x6 = -211
Moving on, x7 = x6 - x5 + x4 - x3
= -211 - 267 + 523 - 420
Let's compute:
-211 - 267 = -478
-478 + 523 = 45
45 - 420 = -375
Therefore, x7 = -375
Next, x8 = x7 - x6 + x5 - x4
= -375 - (-211) + 267 - 523
Simplify step by step:
-375 - (-211) = -375 + 211 = -164
-164 + 267 = 103
103 - 523 = -420
So x8 = -420
Compute x9: x8 - x7 + x6 - x5
= -420 - (-375) + (-211) - 267
Calculate:
-420 + 375 = -45
-45 - 211 = -256
-256 - 267 = -523
Hence, x9 = -523
x10 = x9 - x8 + x7 - x6
= -523 - (-420) + (-375) - (-211)
Breaking it down:
-523 + 420 = -103
-103 - 375 = -478
-478 + 211 = -267
Therefore, x10 = -267
x11 = x10 - x9 + x8 - x7
= -267 - (-523) + (-420) - (-375)
Calculations:
-267 + 523 = 256
256 - 420 = -164
-164 + 375 = 211
So x11 = 211
Wait, 211 is the same as x1.
Let me check that again.
x10 is -267, x9 is -523, x8 is -420, x7 is -375.
So for x11: -267 - (-523) + (-420) - (-375) = -267 + 523 - 420 + 375.
Let's recompute:
523 - 267 = 256; 256 - 420 = -164; -164 + 375 = 211.
Yes, x11 = 211, which is x1.
Then x12:
x11 - x10 + x9 - x8
= 211 - (-267) + (-523) - (-420)
= 211 + 267 - 523 + 420
Compute:
211 + 267 = 478
478 - 523 = -45
-45 + 420 = 375
So x12 = 375, which is x2.
Interesting.
Let's tabulate the terms we have so far:
x1 = 211
x2 = 375
x3 = 420
x4 = 523
x5 = 267
x6 = -211
x7 = -375
x8 = -420
x9 = -523
x10 = -267
x11 = 211
x12 = 375
Wait a minute, x11 and x12 are repeating x1 and x2.
Let's compute x13, x14 to confirm:
x13 = x12 - x11 + x10 - x9
= 375 - 211 + (-267) - (-523)
Compute:
375 - 211 = 164
164 - 267 = -103
-103 + 523 = 420
So x13 = 420, which is x3.
Then x14:
x13 - x12 + x11 - x10
= 420 - 375 + 211 - (-267)
Calculations:
420 - 375 = 45
45 + 211 = 256
256 + 267 = 523
So x14 = 523, which is x4.
Then x15:
x14 - x13 + x12 - x11
= 523 - 420 + 375 - 211
Wait, this is similar to x5's calculation.
Compute:
523 - 420 = 103
103 + 375 = 478
478 - 211 = 267
Hence, x15 = 267, same as x5.
This seems to confirm that the sequence is periodic with period 10.
Let's verify:
x1 = 211, x11 = 211
x2 = 375, x12 = 375
x3 = 420, x13 = 420
x4 = 523, x14 = 523
x5 = 267, x15 = 267
Similarly, x6 = -211 (at n=6 and n=16 would be same if period 10).
Let's check x16:
x15 - x14 + x13 - x12
= 267 - 523 + 420 - 375
Compute:
267 - 523 = -256
-256 + 420 = 164
164 - 375 = -211
So x16 = -211, same as x6.
Similarly, x17:
x16 - x15 + x14 - x13
= -211 - 267 + 523 - 420
Let's compute:
-211 - 267 = -478
-478 + 523 = 45
45 - 420 = -375
So x17 = -375, matching x7.
Continuing this way, we can see that x18 = x8, and so on.
Therefore, the sequence indeed has a period of 10.
Therefore, the sequence repeats every 10 terms.
So, the period is 10.
That means xn = x(n mod 10) for n ≥ 1.
Wait, but x11 = x1, so n mod 10 gives the equivalent term in the first period.
However, when n ≡ 1 mod 10, xn = x1, n ≡ 2 mod 10, xn = x2, ..., n ≡ 0 mod 10, xn = x10.
Wait, but x10 is -267, x11 is x1 = 211, x12 = x2 = 375, etc.
So actually, the period is 10, starting from x1 to x10, then repeating.
So xn = x((n-1) mod 10 + 1).
So for any n, we can find the equivalent term in the first 10 terms by computing (n - 1) mod 10, then adding 1.
For example, n = 11: (11 -1 ) mod 10 = 10 mod 10 = 0, add 1, becomes x1.
Similarly, n = 12: (12 -1 ) mod 10 =11 mod 10=1, add1= x2.
Wait, actually, perhaps the modulo operation here needs to cycle with period 10, so n mod 10, but adjusted.
Let me confirm.
If period is 10, then x(n) = x((n-1) mod 10 +1).
For example:
n = 1: (1-1) mod 10 +1= 0+1=1
n=2: (2-1) mod 10 +1=1+1=2
...
n=10: (10-1) mod 10 +1=9 mod10 +1=9+1=10
n=11: (11-1) mod10 +1=10 mod10 +1=0+1=1
n=12: (12-1) mod10 +1=11 mod10 +1=1+1=2, and so on.
Yes, so the formula is x(n) = x((n-1) mod 10 +1).
So for any given n, compute (n-1) mod10, then add 1, which gives the corresponding term in the first 10 terms.
Therefore, to compute x531, x753, x975, we can find (531 -1) mod10, (753 -1) mod10, and (975 -1) mod10, then add1, find the corresponding term.
Let's verify with x11: (11 -1) mod10=10 mod10=0, then +1=1⇒x11=x1=211, which is correct.
Similarly, x12=(12-1)=11 mod10=1, +1=2⇒x2=375, correct.
Therefore, the formula works.
Therefore, to compute xk, compute (k -1) mod10, then +1, and get the corresponding x from the first 10 terms.
So let's proceed.
First, compute x531:
Compute (531 -1) mod10=530 mod10=0⇒0+1=1⇒x531=x1=211
Wait, 530 divided by 10 is 53 with remainder 0.
Similarly, x753:
(753 -1)=752 mod10=752 mod10=2⇒2+1=3⇒x3=420
Because 752 divided by 10 is 75*10 + 2, remainder 2.
x975:
(975 -1)=974 mod10=4⇒4+1=5⇒x5=267
Since 974 divided by 10 is 97*10 +4, remainder 4.
Therefore:
x531 = x1=211
x753 = x3=420
x975 =x5=267
So the sum is 211 +420 +267.
Let me compute that:
211 +420=631
631 +267=898
Wait, but hold on, let me check the previous steps again.
First, confirming the period is 10.
From the initial terms, x1 to x10:
x1=211, x2=375, x3=420, x4=523, x5=267, x6=-211, x7=-375, x8=-420, x9=-523, x10=-267
Then x11=211, x12=375, etc.
So yes, period 10.
Therefore, to compute xn, (n-1) mod10 +1 gives the position in the first 10 terms.
Therefore:
x531: n=531
Compute (531 -1)=530 mod10=0⇒0+1=1⇒x1=211
x753: (753 -1)=752 mod10=2⇒2+1=3⇒x3=420
Wait, hold on, (752 mod10)=2, then +1=3, so x3=420. Correct.
x975: (975 -1)=974 mod10=4⇒4 +1=5⇒x5=267.
Yes, 974 mod10 is 4, +1=5.
So sum is 211 +420 +267=211+420=631, 631+267=898.
But before finalizing the answer, let me double-check the calculation of the terms.
For example, x531: if the period is 10, starting at x1, then every 10 terms it cycles.
So term number 1, 11, 21, ..., 531 would correspond to x1.
Since (531-1)/10=53. So 53 full cycles, thus x531=x1.
Similarly, 753-1=752, 752/10=75.2, so 75 full cycles and 2 remainder, which maps to the 2+1=3rd term, which is x3.
975-1=974, 974/10=97.4, so 97 full cycles, remainder 4, maps to 4+1=5th term, x5.
All right, seems correct.
But let me check another term as well.
For example, x16: (16-1)=15 mod10=5⇒x5=267.
From previous calculations, x16 was -211, but x5 is 267.
Wait, this discrepancy suggests that perhaps my initial assumption about the period is incorrect.
Wait, hold on, this is confusing.
Wait, when n=11, x11=x1=211, x12=x2=375, x13=x3=420, x14=x4=523, x15=x5=267, x16=x6=-211, etc.
But according to the period, n=6 is x6=-211, but when n=16, it's also x6=-211.
But according to the modulo formula (n-1) mod10 +1:
For n=16: (16-1)=15 mod10=5⇒5+1=6⇒x6=-211.
Which is correct.
Similarly, n=6: (6-1)=5 mod10=5⇒x6=-211.
So that works.
But in our calculation above, x15 =x5=267, which according to the formula:
(n-1) mod10 +1: 15-1=14 mod10=4⇒4+1=5⇒x5=267.
But our initial terms have x15=267.
Wait, but x15 should be equivalent to x5.
But according to the list:
Original terms:
x1=211
x2=375
x3=420
x4=523
x5=267
x6=-211
x7=-375
x8=-420
x9=-523
x10=-267
Then x11=211=x1
x12=375=x2
x13=420=x3
x14=523=x4
x15=267=x5
x16=-211=x6, etc.
So yes, each term xn for n>10 corresponds to x(n mod10?).
Wait, but the formula (n-1) mod10 +1 is correct here.
For example, n=15:
(15-1)=14 mod10=4⇒4+1=5⇒x5=267.
Which matches.
Similarly, n=5: (5-1)=4 mod10=4⇒x5 is associated with position 5, which is indeed x5.
So the formula holds.
Therefore, the calculation for x531, x753, x975 is correct as per the formula.
But let me check another example.
Let's take n=17.
Should be x7=-375.
Compute (17-1)=16 mod10=6⇒6+1=7⇒x7=-375.
Correct.
Similarly, n=18 gives x8=-420.
So the formula seems valid.
Therefore, returning to the problem.
We need to compute x531 + x753 +x975.
Which are 211,420,267 respectively.
Adding them gives 211+420=631, 631+267=898.
But before finalizing, let me verify once again.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>

1: The term x531 is determined using the formula (531-1) mod 10 +1 = 0 +1 = 1, corresponding to x1 = 211. This calculation is verified.

2: The term x753 is calculated using the formula with n=753. The expression (753 - 1) mod 10 equals 752 mod 10, which is 2. Adding 1 to this result gives 3, so x753 corresponds to x3. The value of x3 is 420.
</Path>
<Path>
3: For x975, compute (975 - 1) mod 10 = 974 mod 10 = 4. Adding 1 gives 5, so x975 = x5 = 267.

<Conclusion>
The calculations confirm that x531 corresponds to x1 (211), x753 corresponds to x3 (420), and x975 corresponds to x5 (267).

Adding these together: 211 + 420 + 267.
Let's think in parallel.

<Conclusion>
The sum of 211 and 420 is 631, and the sum of 631 and 267 is 898.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Therefore, the final answer is 898.
But to ensure there are no mistakes, let's check the original sequence again.
Looking back at the terms:
x1=211
x2=375
x3=420
x4=523
x5=267
x6=-211
x7=-375
x8=-420
x9=-523
x10=-267
Then x11=211, x12=375, etc.
So yes, periodic with period 10.
Therefore, every 10 terms it cycles.
Therefore, term numbers:
531: 530 is 53*10, so 530th term is x10, next term, 531st, is x1=211.
Wait, but according to the modulus method, (531-1) mod10=0→x1.
Same result.
But stepping through cycles:
Each cycle is 10 terms.
So starting at term 1: x1.
Term 11: x1, term 21: x1, ..., term 1 + 10k, k=0,1,2,...
So term 1 + 10k: x1.
Similarly, term 3 + 10k would correspond to x3.
So 531: 531 =1 + 530=1 + 10*53.
So yes, term 531 is x1=211.
753=3 + 750=3 + 10*75.
So term 753 is x3=420.
975=5 + 970=5 + 10*97.
So term 975 is x5=267.
So this way also, it's clear.
Therefore, adding up 211+420+267=898.
The answer is 898.
**Final Answer** 
\boxed{898}
</Think>

Answer: Given the sequence defined by:
\[
\begin{align*}
x_{1} &= 211, \\
x_{2} &= 375, \\
x_{3} &= 420, \\
x_{4} &= 523, \\
x_{n} &= x_{n-1} - x_{n-2} + x_{n-3} - x_{n-4} \quad \text{for } n \geq 5,
\end{align*}
\]
we need to find the value of \(x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975}\).

First, we compute the initial terms of the sequence to identify any periodicity:
\[
\begin{align*}
x_5 &= x_4 - x_3 + x_2 - x_1 = 523 - 420 + 375 - 211 = 267, \\
x_6 &= x_5 - x_4 + x_3 - x_2 = 267 - 523 + 420 - 375 = -211, \\
x_7 &= x_6 - x_5 + x_4 - x_3 = -211 - 267 + 523 - 420 = -375, \\
x_8 &= x_7 - x_6 + x_5 - x_4 = -375 - (-211) + 267 - 523 = -420, \\
x_9 &= x_8 - x_7 + x_6 - x_5 = -420 - (-375) + (-211) - 267 = -523, \\
x_{10} &= x_9 - x_8 + x_7 - x_6 = -523 - (-420) + (-375) - (-211) = -267, \\
x_{11} &= x_{10} - x_9 + x_8 - x_7 = -267 - (-523) + (-420) - (-375) = 211, \\
x_{12} &= x_{11} - x_{10} + x_9 - x_8 = 211 - (-267) + (-523) - (-420) = 375.
\end{align*}
\]
Observing that \(x_{11} = x_1\) and \(x_{12} = x_2\), we conclude the sequence is periodic with period 10.

To find \(x_{531}\), \(x_{753}\), and \(x_{975}\), we compute the positions modulo 10:
\[
\begin{align*}
531 &\equiv 1 \pmod{10} \implies x_{531} = x_1 = 211, \\
753 &\equiv 3 \pmod{10} \implies x_{753} = x_3 = 420, \\
975 &\equiv 5 \pmod{10} \implies x_{975} = x_5 = 267.
\end{align*}
\]
Summing these values:
\[
x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975} = 211 + 420 + 267 = 898.
\]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{898}
\]

<think>
okay, let's tackle this problem step by step.
so, we're given a sequence where the first four terms are x1 = 211, x2 = 375, x3 = 420, x4 = 523.
for n ≥ 5, each term is defined as xn = xn−1 - xn−2 + xn−3 - xn−4.
we need to find the value of x531 + x753 + x975.
hmm, that seems like a lot of terms to compute.
calculating each term up to 531, 753, and 975 would be tedious and time-consuming.
there must be a pattern or periodicity in this sequence that we can exploit.
let me recall that when sequences are defined by linear recurrence relations with constant coefficients, they often exhibit periodic behavior, especially when the coefficients alternate in sign like here.
first, let me write down the recurrence relation again:
xn = xn−1 - xn−2 + xn−3 - xn−4 for n ≥ 5.
so each term is dependent on the previous four terms with alternating signs.
to figure out if this sequence is periodic, i should compute some terms and see if the sequence repeats.
if it does, we can find the period and then compute the required terms modulo the period to simplify the calculations.
let me start by calculating the first few terms manually.
we already have:
x1 = 211
x2 = 375
x3 = 420
x4 = 523
now, let's compute x5:
x5 = x4 - x3 + x2 - x1
= 523 - 420 + 375 - 211
let me compute that step by step:
523 - 420 = 103
103 + 375 = 478
478 - 211 = 267
so x5 = 267
next, x6 = x5 - x4 + x3 - x2
= 267 - 523 + 420 - 375
calculating step by step:
267 - 523 = -256
-256 + 420 = 164
164 - 375 = -211
hence, x6 = -211
moving on, x7 = x6 - x5 + x4 - x3
= -211 - 267 + 523 - 420
let's compute:
-211 - 267 = -478
-478 + 523 = 45
45 - 420 = -375
therefore, x7 = -375
next, x8 = x7 - x6 + x5 - x4
= -375 - (-211) + 267 - 523
simplify step by step:
-375 - (-211) = -375 + 211 = -164
-164 + 267 = 103
103 - 523 = -420
so x8 = -420
compute x9: x8 - x7 + x6 - x5
= -420 - (-375) + (-211) - 267
calculate:
-420 + 375 = -45
-45 - 211 = -256
-256 - 267 = -523
hence, x9 = -523
x10 = x9 - x8 + x7 - x6
= -523 - (-420) + (-375) - (-211)
breaking it down:
-523 + 420 = -103
-103 - 375 = -478
-478 + 211 = -267
therefore, x10 = -267
x11 = x10 - x9 + x8 - x7
= -267 - (-523) + (-420) - (-375)
calculations:
-267 + 523 = 256
256 - 420 = -164
-164 + 375 = 211
so x11 = 211
wait, 211 is the same as x1.
let me check that again.
x10 is -267, x9 is -523, x8 is -420, x7 is -375.
so for x11: -267 - (-523) + (-420) - (-375) = -267 + 523 - 420 + 375.
let's recompute:
523 - 267 = 256; 256 - 420 = -164; -164 + 375 = 211.
yes, x11 = 211, which is x1.
then x12:
x11 - x10 + x9 - x8
= 211 - (-267) + (-523) - (-420)
= 211 + 267 - 523 + 420
compute:
211 + 267 = 478
478 - 523 = -45
-45 + 420 = 375
so x12 = 375, which is x2.
interesting.
let's tabulate the terms we have so far:
x1 = 211
x2 = 375
x3 = 420
x4 = 523
x5 = 267
x6 = -211
x7 = -375
x8 = -420
x9 = -523
x10 = -267
x11 = 211
x12 = 375
wait a minute, x11 and x12 are repeating x1 and x2.
let's compute x13, x14 to confirm:
x13 = x12 - x11 + x10 - x9
= 375 - 211 + (-267) - (-523)
compute:
375 - 211 = 164
164 - 267 = -103
-103 + 523 = 420
so x13 = 420, which is x3.
then x14:
x13 - x12 + x11 - x10
= 420 - 375 + 211 - (-267)
calculations:
420 - 375 = 45
45 + 211 = 256
256 + 267 = 523
so x14 = 523, which is x4.
then x15:
x14 - x13 + x12 - x11
= 523 - 420 + 375 - 211
wait, this is similar to x5's calculation.
compute:
523 - 420 = 103
103 + 375 = 478
478 - 211 = 267
hence, x15 = 267, same as x5.
this seems to confirm that the sequence is periodic with period 10.
let's verify:
x1 = 211, x11 = 211
x2 = 375, x12 = 375
x3 = 420, x13 = 420
x4 = 523, x14 = 523
x5 = 267, x15 = 267
similarly, x6 = -211 (at n=6 and n=16 would be same if period 10).
let's check x16:
x15 - x14 + x13 - x12
= 267 - 523 + 420 - 375
compute:
267 - 523 = -256
-256 + 420 = 164
164 - 375 = -211
so x16 = -211, same as x6.
similarly, x17:
x16 - x15 + x14 - x13
= -211 - 267 + 523 - 420
let's compute:
-211 - 267 = -478
-478 + 523 = 45
45 - 420 = -375
so x17 = -375, matching x7.
continuing this way, we can see that x18 = x8, and so on.
therefore, the sequence indeed has a period of 10.
therefore, the sequence repeats every 10 terms.
so, the period is 10.
that means xn = x(n mod 10) for n ≥ 1.
wait, but x11 = x1, so n mod 10 gives the equivalent term in the first period.
however, when n ≡ 1 mod 10, xn = x1, n ≡ 2 mod 10, xn = x2, ..., n ≡ 0 mod 10, xn = x10.
wait, but x10 is -267, x11 is x1 = 211, x12 = x2 = 375, etc.
so actually, the period is 10, starting from x1 to x10, then repeating.
so xn = x((n-1) mod 10 + 1).
so for any n, we can find the equivalent term in the first 10 terms by computing (n - 1) mod 10, then adding 1.
for example, n = 11: (11 -1 ) mod 10 = 10 mod 10 = 0, add 1, becomes x1.
similarly, n = 12: (12 -1 ) mod 10 =11 mod 10=1, add1= x2.
wait, actually, perhaps the modulo operation here needs to cycle with period 10, so n mod 10, but adjusted.
let me confirm.
if period is 10, then x(n) = x((n-1) mod 10 +1).
for example:
n = 1: (1-1) mod 10 +1= 0+1=1
n=2: (2-1) mod 10 +1=1+1=2
...
n=10: (10-1) mod 10 +1=9 mod10 +1=9+1=10
n=11: (11-1) mod10 +1=10 mod10 +1=0+1=1
n=12: (12-1) mod10 +1=11 mod10 +1=1+1=2, and so on.
yes, so the formula is x(n) = x((n-1) mod 10 +1).
so for any given n, compute (n-1) mod10, then add 1, which gives the corresponding term in the first 10 terms.
therefore, to compute x531, x753, x975, we can find (531 -1) mod10, (753 -1) mod10, and (975 -1) mod10, then add1, find the corresponding term.
let's verify with x11: (11 -1) mod10=10 mod10=0, then +1=1⇒x11=x1=211, which is correct.
similarly, x12=(12-1)=11 mod10=1, +1=2⇒x2=375, correct.
therefore, the formula works.
therefore, to compute xk, compute (k -1) mod10, then +1, and get the corresponding x from the first 10 terms.
so let's proceed.
first, compute x531:
compute (531 -1) mod10=530 mod10=0⇒0+1=1⇒x531=x1=211
wait, 530 divided by 10 is 53 with remainder 0.
similarly, x753:
(753 -1)=752 mod10=752 mod10=2⇒2+1=3⇒x3=420
because 752 divided by 10 is 75*10 + 2, remainder 2.
x975:
(975 -1)=974 mod10=4⇒4+1=5⇒x5=267
since 974 divided by 10 is 97*10 +4, remainder 4.
therefore:
x531 = x1=211
x753 = x3=420
x975 =x5=267
so the sum is 211 +420 +267.
let me compute that:
211 +420=631
631 +267=898
wait, but hold on, let me check the previous steps again.
first, confirming the period is 10.
from the initial terms, x1 to x10:
x1=211, x2=375, x3=420, x4=523, x5=267, x6=-211, x7=-375, x8=-420, x9=-523, x10=-267
then x11=211, x12=375, etc.
so yes, period 10.
therefore, to compute xn, (n-1) mod10 +1 gives the position in the first 10 terms.
therefore:
x531: n=531
compute (531 -1)=530 mod10=0⇒0+1=1⇒x1=211
x753: (753 -1)=752 mod10=2⇒2+1=3⇒x3=420
wait, hold on, (752 mod10)=2, then +1=3, so x3=420. correct.
x975: (975 -1)=974 mod10=4⇒4 +1=5⇒x5=267.
yes, 974 mod10 is 4, +1=5.
so sum is 211 +420 +267=211+420=631, 631+267=898.
but before finalizing the answer, let me double-check the calculation of the terms.
for example, x531: if the period is 10, starting at x1, then every 10 terms it cycles.
so term number 1, 11, 21, ..., 531 would correspond to x1.
since (531-1)/10=53. so 53 full cycles, thus x531=x1.
similarly, 753-1=752, 752/10=75.2, so 75 full cycles and 2 remainder, which maps to the 2+1=3rd term, which is x3.
975-1=974, 974/10=97.4, so 97 full cycles, remainder 4, maps to 4+1=5th term, x5.
all right, seems correct.
but let me check another term as well.
for example, x16: (16-1)=15 mod10=5⇒x5=267.
from previous calculations, x16 was -211, but x5 is 267.
wait, this discrepancy suggests that perhaps my initial assumption about the period is incorrect.
wait, hold on, this is confusing.
wait, when n=11, x11=x1=211, x12=x2=375, x13=x3=420, x14=x4=523, x15=x5=267, x16=x6=-211, etc.
but according to the period, n=6 is x6=-211, but when n=16, it's also x6=-211.
but according to the modulo formula (n-1) mod10 +1:
for n=16: (16-1)=15 mod10=5⇒5+1=6⇒x6=-211.
which is correct.
similarly, n=6: (6-1)=5 mod10=5⇒x6=-211.
so that works.
but in our calculation above, x15 =x5=267, which according to the formula:
(n-1) mod10 +1: 15-1=14 mod10=4⇒4+1=5⇒x5=267.
but our initial terms have x15=267.
wait, but x15 should be equivalent to x5.
but according to the list:
original terms:
x1=211
x2=375
x3=420
x4=523
x5=267
x6=-211
x7=-375
x8=-420
x9=-523
x10=-267
then x11=211=x1
x12=375=x2
x13=420=x3
x14=523=x4
x15=267=x5
x16=-211=x6, etc.
so yes, each term xn for n>10 corresponds to x(n mod10?).
wait, but the formula (n-1) mod10 +1 is correct here.
for example, n=15:
(15-1)=14 mod10=4⇒4+1=5⇒x5=267.
which matches.
similarly, n=5: (5-1)=4 mod10=4⇒x5 is associated with position 5, which is indeed x5.
so the formula holds.
therefore, the calculation for x531, x753, x975 is correct as per the formula.
but let me check another example.
let's take n=17.
should be x7=-375.
compute (17-1)=16 mod10=6⇒6+1=7⇒x7=-375.
correct.
similarly, n=18 gives x8=-420.
so the formula seems valid.
therefore, returning to the problem.
we need to compute x531 + x753 +x975.
which are 211,420,267 respectively.
adding them gives 211+420=631, 631+267=898.
but before finalizing, let me verify once again.
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>
<goal>
<outline>
1: verify the calculation of x531 using the modulo formula.
</outline>
<outline>
2: verify the calculation of x753 using the modulo formula.

<outline>
3: verify the calculation of x975 using the modulo formula.

<path>
1: the term x531 is determined using the formula (531-1) mod 10 +1 = 0 +1 = 1, corresponding to x1 = 211. this calculation is verified.
</path>
<path>
2: the term x753 is calculated using the formula with n=753. the expression (753 - 1) mod 10 equals 752 mod 10, which is 2. adding 1 to this result gives 3, so x753 corresponds to x3. the value of x3 is 420.
</path>
<path>
3: for x975, compute (975 - 1) mod 10 = 974 mod 10 = 4. adding 1 gives 5, so x975 = x5 = 267.

<conclusion>
the calculations confirm that x531 corresponds to x1 (211), x753 corresponds to x3 (420), and x975 corresponds to x5 (267).
</conclusion>
</parallel>
adding these together: 211 + 420 + 267.
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>
<goal>
<outline>
1: the sum of 211 and 420.
</outline>
<outline>
2: the sum of 631 and 267.

</path>
<conclusion>
the sum of 211 and 420 is 631, and the sum of 631 and 267 is 898.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
therefore, the final answer is 898.
but to ensure there are no mistakes, let's check the original sequence again.
looking back at the terms:
x1=211
x2=375
x3=420
x4=523
x5=267
x6=-211
x7=-375
x8=-420
x9=-523
x10=-267
then x11=211, x12=375, etc.
so yes, periodic with period 10.
therefore, every 10 terms it cycles.
therefore, term numbers:
531: 530 is 53*10, so 530th term is x10, next term, 531st, is x1=211.
wait, but according to the modulus method, (531-1) mod10=0→x1.
same result.
but stepping through cycles:
each cycle is 10 terms.
so starting at term 1: x1.
term 11: x1, term 21: x1, ..., term 1 + 10k, k=0,1,2,...
so term 1 + 10k: x1.
similarly, term 3 + 10k would correspond to x3.
so 531: 531 =1 + 530=1 + 10*53.
so yes, term 531 is x1=211.
753=3 + 750=3 + 10*75.
so term 753 is x3=420.
975=5 + 970=5 + 10*97.
so term 975 is x5=267.
so this way also, it's clear.
therefore, adding up 211+420+267=898.
the answer is 898.
**final answer** 
\boxed{898}
</think>

answer: given the sequence defined by:
\[
\begin{align*}
x_{1} &= 211, \\
x_{2} &= 375, \\
x_{3} &= 420, \\
x_{4} &= 523, \\
x_{n} &= x_{n-1} - x_{n-2} + x_{n-3} - x_{n-4} \quad \text{for } n \geq 5,
\end{align*}
\]
we need to find the value of \(x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975}\).

first, we compute the initial terms of the sequence to identify any periodicity:
\[
\begin{align*}
x_5 &= x_4 - x_3 + x_2 - x_1 = 523 - 420 + 375 - 211 = 267, \\
x_6 &= x_5 - x_4 + x_3 - x_2 = 267 - 523 + 420 - 375 = -211, \\
x_7 &= x_6 - x_5 + x_4 - x_3 = -211 - 267 + 523 - 420 = -375, \\
x_8 &= x_7 - x_6 + x_5 - x_4 = -375 - (-211) + 267 - 523 = -420, \\
x_9 &= x_8 - x_7 + x_6 - x_5 = -420 - (-375) + (-211) - 267 = -523, \\
x_{10} &= x_9 - x_8 + x_7 - x_6 = -523 - (-420) + (-375) - (-211) = -267, \\
x_{11} &= x_{10} - x_9 + x_8 - x_7 = -267 - (-523) + (-420) - (-375) = 211, \\
x_{12} &= x_{11} - x_{10} + x_9 - x_8 = 211 - (-267) + (-523) - (-420) = 375.
\end{align*}
\]
observing that \(x_{11} = x_1\) and \(x_{12} = x_2\), we conclude the sequence is periodic with period 10.

to find \(x_{531}\), \(x_{753}\), and \(x_{975}\), we compute the positions modulo 10:
\[
\begin{align*}
531 &\equiv 1 \pmod{10} \implies x_{531} = x_1 = 211, \\
753 &\equiv 3 \pmod{10} \implies x_{753} = x_3 = 420, \\
975 &\equiv 5 \pmod{10} \implies x_{975} = x_5 = 267.
\end{align*}
\]
summing these values:
\[
x_{531} + x_{753} + x_{975} = 211 + 420 + 267 = 898.
\]

the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{898}
\]
