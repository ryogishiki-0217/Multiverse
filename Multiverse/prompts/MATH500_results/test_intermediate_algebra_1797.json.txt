<Think>
Okay, so I need to find the distance between the foci of a hyperbola given its asymptotes and a point it passes through.
Let's see... First, I remember that the equations of the asymptotes of a hyperbola can help me determine the center of the hyperbola.
The center is the midpoint between the two asymptotes.
Let me recall how to find the center from the asymptotes.
If the asymptotes are intersecting lines, the point of intersection is the center, right?
Wait, but in this case, the asymptotes are given as $y = 2x - 3$ and $y = 17 - 2x$.
Let me check if they intersect by solving the equations.
Set 2x - 3 = 17 - 2x.
Adding 2x to both sides gives 4x - 3 = 17.
Adding 3 gives 4x = 20, so x = 5.
Then y = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7.
So the center is at (5,7).
Wait, but actually, the center of the hyperbola is the intersection point of its asymptotes.
So if the asymptotes intersect at (5,7), that's the center.
Hmm, but hold on.
Let's make sure.
Because sometimes hyperbolas can be shifted, but the center is still the midpoint between the asymptotes.
Wait, no, actually, the asymptotes of a hyperbola always intersect at the center of the hyperbola.
So if I find the point of intersection of the two asymptotes, that will be the center.
So let me confirm by solving the two equations:
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: Determination of the intersection point of the asymptotes y = 2x - 3 and y = 17 - 2x.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: Determination of the hyperbola's center based on the asymptote intersection.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The equations of the asymptotes are y = 2x - 3 and y = 17 - 2x. Setting these equations equal to find their intersection yields 2x - 3 = 17 - 2x. Rearranging terms, 2x + 2x = 17 + 3, which simplifies to 4x = 20. Solving for x gives x = 5. Substituting x = 5 into the first asymptote equation, y = 2(5) - 3, results in y = 10 - 3 = 7. The intersection point of the asymptotes is (5, 7).
</Path>
<Path>
2: The intersection point (5,7) is confirmed as the hyperbola's center.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The point of intersection of the asymptotes y = 2x - 3 and y = 17 - 2x is (5,7), which is confirmed as the center of the hyperbola.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So the center is (5,7).
Now, the next step is to determine the orientation of the hyperbola.
Since the asymptotes are $y = 2x - 3$ and $y = 17 - 2x$, their slopes are +2 and -2, which suggests that the hyperbola is oriented vertically or horizontally?
Wait, the slopes of the asymptotes for a standard horizontal hyperbola are ±(b/a), and for a vertical hyperbola, they are ±(a/b).
Wait, no, let me check.
Wait, for a hyperbola centered at (h,k) with a horizontal transverse axis, the asymptotes are y = k ± (b/a)(x - h).
For a vertical transverse axis, the asymptotes are y = k ± (a/b)(x - h).
In this case, the slopes of the asymptotes are ±2.
So if the slopes are ±2, then depending on the orientation, either b/a = 2 or a/b = 2.
So I need to figure out if the hyperbola is horizontal or vertical.
But how can I determine that?
Wait, the slopes of the asymptotes alone may not tell me the orientation?
Wait, actually, for a horizontal hyperbola, the asymptotes have slopes ±(b/a), and for a vertical hyperbola, slopes are ±(a/b).
So if the given slopes are ±2, then if the hyperbola is horizontal, b/a = 2; if vertical, a/b = 2.
But how do I know which one it is?
Maybe the hyperbola passes through a certain point.
Wait, the problem says the hyperbola passes through (4,7).
Let me see.
Let's check the center: (5,7).
The point (4,7) is one unit left of the center.
Wait, if the hyperbola has a horizontal transverse axis, then its vertices are left and right of the center, so (5 ± a, 7).
If it's vertical, the vertices are (5, 7 ± a).
Since the hyperbola passes through (4,7), which is at the same y-coordinate as the center, if this is a horizontal hyperbola, then (4,7) could be a point on it.
But for a vertical hyperbola, points on it would have coordinates along the vertical axis.
Hmm.
Wait, let's not jump the gun.
Let's derive the equation properly.
First, since the asymptotes are y = 2x - 3 and y = 17 - 2x, which can be rewritten as y - 7 = 2(x - 5) and y - 7 = -2(x - 5).
So in the form y - k = ±slope*(x - h), where (h,k) is the center.
So the center is (5,7), and the slopes of the asymptotes are ±2.
Therefore, for a horizontal hyperbola, the slopes would be ±(b/a), so if the slopes are ±2, then b/a = 2.
For a vertical hyperbola, the slopes are ±(a/b), so if the slopes are ±2, then a/b = 2, so a = 2b.
But how do we distinguish between vertical and horizontal?
Wait, the equations of the asymptotes are y - k = ±(b/a)(x - h) for a horizontal hyperbola, and y - k = ±(a/b)(x - h) for a vertical hyperbola.
But in our case, the asymptotes are y - 7 = ±2(x - 5).
So the slopes are ±2.
Comparing this to the standard forms, if it's a horizontal hyperbola, then b/a = 2; if vertical, a/b = 2.
But the problem is that both horizontal and vertical hyperbolas can have asymptotes with slopes ±2.
So how do we determine which one it is?
Wait, perhaps by checking the point (4,7).
Let's see.
If the hyperbola is horizontal, centered at (5,7), then the standard equation is:
((x - 5)^2)/a^2 - ((y - 7)^2)/b^2 = 1
If it's vertical, then:
((y - 7)^2)/a^2 - ((x - 5)^2)/b^2 = 1
Let's plug the point (4,7) into both equations and see which one could be possible.
For the horizontal hyperbola:
((4 - 5)^2)/a^2 - ((7 - 7)^2)/b^2 = 1
Simplifies to (1)/a^2 - 0 = 1, so 1/a^2 = 1, so a^2 = 1, so a = 1.
So that's possible.
For the vertical hyperbola:
((7 - 7)^2)/a^2 - ((4 - 5)^2)/b^2 = 1
Simplifies to 0 - 1/b^2 = 1, which would mean -1/b^2 = 1, which would imply b^2 = -1.
Which is impossible because b^2 must be positive.
Therefore, the hyperbola must be horizontal.
So, the equation is ((x - 5)^2)/a^2 - ((y - 7)^2)/b^2 = 1, with a = 1 (from above).
Then, since the asymptotes are y - k = ±(b/a)(x - h), which here is y - 7 = ±2(x - 5).
So since for a horizontal hyperbola, the slopes are ±(b/a), so we have b/a = 2.
Since a = 1, then b = 2*1 = 2.
Therefore, b = 2, so b^2 = 4.
Therefore, the equation of the hyperbola is ((x - 5)^2)/1 - ((y - 7)^2)/4 = 1.
Wait, but let me check.
If we plug in the point (4,7), does it satisfy this equation?
Left side: ((4 - 5)^2)/1 - ((7 - 7)^2)/4 = 1/1 - 0 = 1, which equals the right side.
So that works.
Perfect.
So, now that we have the equation of the hyperbola, we need to find the distance between the foci.
For a hyperbola, the distance between the foci is 2c, where c^2 = a^2 + b^2.
Wait, hold on: for hyperbolas, c^2 = a^2 + b^2?
Let me confirm.
Yes, for hyperbolas, the relationship is c^2 = a^2 + b^2, where c is the distance from the center to each focus.
So, since we have a horizontal hyperbola with a^2 = 1 and b^2 = 4, then c^2 = 1 + 4 = 5, so c = sqrt(5).
Therefore, the distance between the foci is 2c = 2*sqrt(5).
Wait, but let me double-check all steps to make sure.
First, confirming the center: intersection of asymptotes.
Setting 2x - 3 = 17 - 2x gives x = 5, y = 7, so center (5,7).
Then, using the point (4,7) to determine the orientation.
Plugging into vertical gives an impossibility, so it must be horizontal.
Therefore, a = 1, since horizontal hyperbola with (x - h)^2/a^2 - (y - k)^2/b^2 = 1.
The asymptotes are y - k = ±(b/a)(x - h).
Given that the slopes are ±2, so b/a = 2.
With a = 1, gives b = 2.
Then c^2 = a^2 + b^2 = 1 + 4 = 5, so c = sqrt(5), distance between foci is 2sqrt(5).
Therefore, the answer should be 2sqrt(5).
Wait, but just to make sure, let me check again.
Is it possible that even though the vertical hyperbola didn't work with the point (4,7), maybe another point would make it work?
But the problem states that the hyperbola passes through (4,7), so the equation must hold there.
Since the vertical hyperbola equation resulted in -1/b^2 = 1, which is impossible, while the horizontal hyperbola successfully passes through (4,7) with a = 1.
So, horizontal hyperbola it is.
Therefore, c^2 = a^2 + b^2.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: The value of c for the hyperbola.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: The distance between the foci.
</Outline>

2: The distance between the foci is calculated as 2 multiplied by the square root of 5, which equals 2√5.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The value of c is sqrt(5), leading to a distance between the foci of 2√5.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Yes.
So then, the final answer is 2√5.
Wait, but maybe they want it in simplified radical form?
2 times sqrt(5).
Yes, that's simplified.
So no problem.
Alternatively, maybe as a decimal?
But unless specified, radical form is fine.
And the problem says "distance between the foci", which is 2c.
So I think 2√5 is correct.
Just to recap:
- Found center (5,7) by intersecting asymptotes.
- Determined horizontal hyperbola because vertical one is impossible with given point (4,7).
- Calculated a = 1 from horizontal hyperbola equation.
- Found b = 2 from slope of asymptotes.
- Computed c = sqrt(5) using c^2 = a^2 + b^2.
- Distance between foci is 2c = 2sqrt(5).
All steps seem correct.
I think that's it.
**Final Answer**
the final answer is \boxed{2\sqrt{5}}
</Think>

Answer: The asymptotes of the hyperbola are given as \( y = 2x - 3 \) and \( y = 17 - 2x \). These asymptotes intersect at the center of the hyperbola. Solving for the intersection point:

\[
2x - 3 = 17 - 2x
\]

\[
4x = 20 \implies x = 5
\]

Substituting \( x = 5 \) back into one of the equations:

\[
y = 2(5) - 3 = 7
\]

Thus, the center of the hyperbola is \((5, 7)\).

Next, we determine the orientation of the hyperbola. The slopes of the asymptotes are \( \pm 2 \). For a horizontal hyperbola, the slopes are \( \pm \frac{b}{a} \), and for a vertical hyperbola, the slopes are \( \pm \frac{a}{b} \). 

Given the hyperbola passes through the point \((4, 7)\), which lies on the same horizontal line as the center, this suggests a horizontal transverse axis. Testing this point in the horizontal hyperbola equation:

\[
\frac{(x - 5)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - 7)^2}{b^2} = 1
\]

Substituting \((4, 7)\):

\[
\frac{(4 - 5)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(7 - 7)^2}{b^2} = 1 \implies \frac{1}{a^2} = 1 \implies a^2 = 1 \implies a = 1
\]

Since the slopes of the asymptotes are \( \pm 2 \), we have \( \frac{b}{a} = 2 \). With \( a = 1 \):

\[
b = 2
\]

For a hyperbola, \( c \) (the distance from the center to each focus) is given by \( c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \):

\[
c^2 = 1 + 4 = 5 \implies c = \sqrt{5}
\]

The distance between the foci is \( 2c \):

\[
2c = 2\sqrt{5}
\]

Thus, the distance between the foci of the hyperbola is \(\boxed{2\sqrt{5}}\).

set 2x - 3 = 17 - 2x.
adding 2x to both sides gives 4x - 3 = 17.

so the center is at (5,7).

so the center is (5,7).
now, the next step is to determine the orientation of the hyperbola.
since the asymptotes are $y = 2x - 3$ and $y = 17 - 2x$, their slopes are +2 and -2, which suggests that the hyperbola is oriented vertically or horizontally?
wait, the slopes of the asymptotes for a standard horizontal hyperbola are ±(b/a), and for a vertical hyperbola, they are ±(a/b).
wait, no, let me check.
wait, for a hyperbola centered at (h,k) with a horizontal transverse axis, the asymptotes are y = k ± (b/a)(x - h).
for a vertical transverse axis, the asymptotes are y = k ± (a/b)(x - h).
in this case, the slopes of the asymptotes are ±2.
so if the slopes are ±2, then depending on the orientation, either b/a = 2 or a/b = 2.

maybe the hyperbola passes through a certain point.

let me see.
let's check the center: (5,7).
the point (4,7) is one unit left of the center.
wait, if the hyperbola has a horizontal transverse axis, then its vertices are left and right of the center, so (5 ± a, 7).
if it's vertical, the vertices are (5, 7 ± a).
since the hyperbola passes through (4,7), which is at the same y-coordinate as the center, if this is a horizontal hyperbola, then (4,7) could be a point on it.
but for a vertical hyperbola, points on it would have coordinates along the vertical axis.
hmm.
wait, let's not jump the gun.
let's derive the equation properly.
first, since the asymptotes are y = 2x - 3 and y = 17 - 2x, which can be rewritten as y - 7 = 2(x - 5) and y - 7 = -2(x - 5).
so in the form y - k = ±slope*(x - h), where (h,k) is the center.
so the center is (5,7), and the slopes of the asymptotes are ±2.
therefore, for a horizontal hyperbola, the slopes would be ±(b/a), so if the slopes are ±2, then b/a = 2.
for a vertical hyperbola, the slopes are ±(a/b), so if the slopes are ±2, then a/b = 2, so a = 2b.
but how do we distinguish between vertical and horizontal?
wait, the equations of the asymptotes are y - k = ±(b/a)(x - h) for a horizontal hyperbola, and y - k = ±(a/b)(x - h) for a vertical hyperbola.
but in our case, the asymptotes are y - 7 = ±2(x - 5).
so the slopes are ±2.
comparing this to the standard forms, if it's a horizontal hyperbola, then b/a = 2; if vertical, a/b = 2.
but the problem is that both horizontal and vertical hyperbolas can have asymptotes with slopes ±2.
so how do we determine which one it is?
wait, perhaps by checking the point (4,7).
let's see.
if the hyperbola is horizontal, centered at (5,7), then the standard equation is:
((x - 5)^2)/a^2 - ((y - 7)^2)/b^2 = 1
if it's vertical, then:
((y - 7)^2)/a^2 - ((x - 5)^2)/b^2 = 1
let's plug the point (4,7) into both equations and see which one could be possible.
for the horizontal hyperbola:
((4 - 5)^2)/a^2 - ((7 - 7)^2)/b^2 = 1
simplifies to (1)/a^2 - 0 = 1, so 1/a^2 = 1, so a^2 = 1, so a = 1.
so that's possible.
for the vertical hyperbola:
((7 - 7)^2)/a^2 - ((4 - 5)^2)/b^2 = 1
simplifies to 0 - 1/b^2 = 1, which would mean -1/b^2 = 1, which would imply b^2 = -1.
which is impossible because b^2 must be positive.
therefore, the hyperbola must be horizontal.
so, the equation is ((x - 5)^2)/a^2 - ((y - 7)^2)/b^2 = 1, with a = 1 (from above).
then, since the asymptotes are y - k = ±(b/a)(x - h), which here is y - 7 = ±2(x - 5).
so since for a horizontal hyperbola, the slopes are ±(b/a), so we have b/a = 2.
since a = 1, then b = 2*1 = 2.
therefore, b = 2, so b^2 = 4.
therefore, the equation of the hyperbola is ((x - 5)^2)/1 - ((y - 7)^2)/4 = 1.
wait, but let me check.
if we plug in the point (4,7), does it satisfy this equation?
left side: ((4 - 5)^2)/1 - ((7 - 7)^2)/4 = 1/1 - 0 = 1, which equals the right side.
so that works.
perfect.
so, now that we have the equation of the hyperbola, we need to find the distance between the foci.
for a hyperbola, the distance between the foci is 2c, where c^2 = a^2 + b^2.
wait, hold on: for hyperbolas, c^2 = a^2 + b^2?
let me confirm.
yes, for hyperbolas, the relationship is c^2 = a^2 + b^2, where c is the distance from the center to each focus.
so, since we have a horizontal hyperbola with a^2 = 1 and b^2 = 4, then c^2 = 1 + 4 = 5, so c = sqrt(5).
therefore, the distance between the foci is 2c = 2*sqrt(5).
wait, but let me double-check all steps to make sure.
first, confirming the center: intersection of asymptotes.
setting 2x - 3 = 17 - 2x gives x = 5, y = 7, so center (5,7).
then, using the point (4,7) to determine the orientation.
plugging into vertical gives an impossibility, so it must be horizontal.
therefore, a = 1, since horizontal hyperbola with (x - h)^2/a^2 - (y - k)^2/b^2 = 1.
the asymptotes are y - k = ±(b/a)(x - h).
given that the slopes are ±2, so b/a = 2.
with a = 1, gives b = 2.
then c^2 = a^2 + b^2 = 1 + 4 = 5, so c = sqrt(5), distance between foci is 2sqrt(5).
therefore, the answer should be 2sqrt(5).
wait, but just to make sure, let me check again.
is it possible that even though the vertical hyperbola didn't work with the point (4,7), maybe another point would make it work?
but the problem states that the hyperbola passes through (4,7), so the equation must hold there.
since the vertical hyperbola equation resulted in -1/b^2 = 1, which is impossible, while the horizontal hyperbola successfully passes through (4,7) with a = 1.
so, horizontal hyperbola it is.
therefore, c^2 = a^2 + b^2.

but unless specified, radical form is fine.
and the problem says "distance between the foci", which is 2c.
so i think 2√5 is correct.
just to recap:

- calculated a = 1 from horizontal hyperbola equation.
- found b = 2 from slope of asymptotes.

- distance between foci is 2c = 2sqrt(5).
all steps seem correct.
i think that's it.
**final answer**
the final answer is \boxed{2\sqrt{5}}
</think>

answer: the asymptotes of the hyperbola are given as \( y = 2x - 3 \) and \( y = 17 - 2x \). these asymptotes intersect at the center of the hyperbola. solving for the intersection point:

\[
2x - 3 = 17 - 2x
\]

\[
4x = 20 \implies x = 5
\]

substituting \( x = 5 \) back into one of the equations:

\[
y = 2(5) - 3 = 7
\]

thus, the center of the hyperbola is \((5, 7)\).

next, we determine the orientation of the hyperbola. the slopes of the asymptotes are \( \pm 2 \). for a horizontal hyperbola, the slopes are \( \pm \frac{b}{a} \), and for a vertical hyperbola, the slopes are \( \pm \frac{a}{b} \). 

given the hyperbola passes through the point \((4, 7)\), which lies on the same horizontal line as the center, this suggests a horizontal transverse axis. testing this point in the horizontal hyperbola equation:

\[
\frac{(x - 5)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - 7)^2}{b^2} = 1
\]

substituting \((4, 7)\):

\[
\frac{(4 - 5)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(7 - 7)^2}{b^2} = 1 \implies \frac{1}{a^2} = 1 \implies a^2 = 1 \implies a = 1
\]

since the slopes of the asymptotes are \( \pm 2 \), we have \( \frac{b}{a} = 2 \). with \( a = 1 \):

\[
b = 2
\]

for a hyperbola, \( c \) (the distance from the center to each focus) is given by \( c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \):

\[
c^2 = 1 + 4 = 5 \implies c = \sqrt{5}
\]

the distance between the foci is \( 2c \):

\[
2c = 2\sqrt{5}
\]

thus, the distance between the foci of the hyperbola is \(\boxed{2\sqrt{5}}\)
