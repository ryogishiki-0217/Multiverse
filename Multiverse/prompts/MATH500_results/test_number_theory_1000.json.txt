Okay, so I need to find the inverse of 17 modulo 83.
That means I have to find an integer x such that (17 * x) ≡ 1 mod 83.
In other words, I need to find x where when I multiply 17 by x and divide by 83, the remainder is 1.
The problem gives a hint that 17*5=85.
Let me think about how that could be helpful.
Let's see, 17 multiplied by 5 is 85, which is 83 + 2.
So 85 ≡ 2 mod 83.
Therefore, 17*5 ≡ 2 mod 83.
Hmm, so maybe I can use this to get to 1 modulo 83 instead of 2.
Let me think.
If 17*5 ≡ 2 mod 83, then if I multiply both sides by something that turns 2 into 1 modulo 83, maybe I can get to the inverse.
Let me explain.
So starting from 17*5 ≡ 85 ≡ 2 mod 83.
If I can find an inverse of 2 modulo 83, then multiplying both sides by that inverse would give me 17*(5*inverse_of_2) ≡ 1 mod 83.
Therefore, the inverse of 17 modulo 83 is 5 times the inverse of 2 modulo 83.
So, first step, compute the inverse of 2 modulo 83.
The inverse of 2 mod 83 is a number y such that 2*y ≡ 1 mod 83.
Let's think in parallel.

1: Determine the inverse of 2 modulo 83 using the equation 2y ≡ 1 mod 83.

<Outline>
2: Determine the inverse of 2 modulo 83 using the equation 2y = 83k + 1 for integer k.

1: The inverse of 2 modulo 83 is a value y satisfying the congruence 2y ≡ 1 mod 83. Testing y=42 shows 2*42 = 84 ≡ 1 mod 83. Therefore, the inverse of 2 modulo 83 is 42.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The equation 2y ≡ 1 mod 83 implies that 2y can be expressed as 83k + 1 for some integer k. This leads to the equation 2y - 83k = 1. The problem of finding integers y and k that satisfy this equation is a linear Diophantine equation.
</Path>
<Path>
3: The inverse of 2 modulo 83 is found by solving 2y ≡ 1 mod 83. This implies 2y = 83k + 1 for some integer k, which can be rearranged to 2y - 83k = 1. The coefficients 2 and 83 are coprime, and a solution exists due to their coprimality. The equation 2y ≡ 1 mod 83 is equivalent to y ≡ (1/2) mod 83. The value y = 42 is tested, as 2*42 = 84, and 84 mod 83 equals 1. This confirms 42 is the inverse of 2 modulo 83.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The inverse of 2 modulo 83 was determined to be 42 through three distinct methods: direct verification (y=42 satisfies 2y ≡ 1 mod 83), solving the linear Diophantine equation 2y - 83k = 1, and recognizing that y ≡ (1/2) mod 83 implies y=42 because 2*42 = 84 ≡ 1 mod 83.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So inverse of 2 mod83 is 42.
Therefore, going back, the inverse of 17 mod83 is 5*42 mod83.
Let me compute that.
5*42 is 210.
Now, 210 modulo 83: 83*2=166, so 210 -166=44.
So 210 ≡44 mod83.
Therefore, is the inverse of 17 mod83 equal to 44?
Let's verify.
Compute 17*44.
Let me see, 17*40=680, 17*4=68, so 680+68=748.
Now, divide 748 by 83.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>

</Outline>
<Outline>
2: The remainder of 748 divided by 83.

</Goal>
<Path>
1: The integer quotient of 83 into 748 is determined to be 9.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The remainder of 748 divided by 83 is 748 minus the product of 83 and 9, which is 748 - 747 = 1.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The integer quotient of 748 divided by 83 is 9, and the remainder is 1.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So 748 ≡1 mod83.
That checks out.
So 17*44 ≡1 mod83.
Therefore, the inverse is 44.
Wait, but just to make sure, is there another way to get there?
Let me think.
Another approach is using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the inverse.
Let's see.
We can compute gcd(17,83).
Since 83 is prime, the gcd is 1, and hence the inverse exists.
Applying the Euclidean algorithm:
83 = 17*4 + 15
17 = 15*1 + 2
15 = 2*7 + 1
2 = 1*2 + 0
So the gcd is 1.
Now, tracing back:
1 = 15 - 2*7
But 2 = 17 - 15*1
So substituting back:
1 = 15 - (17 - 15*1)*7
= 15 -17*7 +15*7
= 15*8 -17*7
But 15 =83 -17*4 (from first step)
Hence,
1 = (83 -17*4)*8 -17*7
=83*8 -17*32 -17*7
=83*8 -17*39
So, this gives:
1 = 83*8 -17*39
Which implies:
-17*39 ≡1 mod83
Hence, multiplying both sides by -1:
17*39 ≡-1 mod83
But I need 17*x ≡1 mod83, so x ≡39*(-1) mod83.
Therefore, x= -39 mod83.
So, 83 -39=44.
So x=44.
Hence, same result.
So this confirms that 44 is the inverse.
Alternatively, if I had noticed that 17*5=85≡2 mod83, then as I initially thought, 17*5 ≡2 => multiply both sides by the inverse of 2 mod83, which is 42, so 17*(5*42)≡1 mod83.
So 5*42=210≡44 mod83.
So same answer.
So yeah, that works.
So the key steps were:
Use the hint given (17*5=85).
Realize 85≡2 mod83.
Find the inverse of 2 mod83, which is 42.
Multiply 5 by 42 and reduce mod83 to get 44.
Or alternatively, use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm steps.
Either way, answer is 44.
Let's think in parallel.

Answer: To compute \(17^{-1} \pmod{83}\), we need to find an integer \(x\) such that \(17x \equiv 1 \pmod{83}\). 

First, we use the hint that \(17 \cdot 5 = 85\). Since \(85 \equiv 2 \pmod{83}\), we have \(17 \cdot 5 \equiv 2 \pmod{83}\). Next, we need to find the inverse of 2 modulo 83. The inverse of 2 modulo 83 is a number \(y\) such that \(2y \equiv 1 \pmod{83}\). By testing values, we find that \(2 \cdot 42 = 84 \equiv 1 \pmod{83}\), so the inverse of 2 modulo 83 is 42.

Multiplying both sides of the congruence \(17 \cdot 5 \equiv 2 \pmod{83}\) by 42, we get:
\[
17 \cdot 5 \cdot 42 \equiv 2 \cdot 42 \pmod{83}
\]
\[
17 \cdot 210 \equiv 84 \pmod{83}
\]
Since \(84 \equiv 1 \pmod{83}\), we have:
\[
17 \cdot 210 \equiv 1 \pmod{83}
\]
Next, we reduce \(210 \pmod{83}\). Calculating \(210 - 2 \cdot 83 = 210 - 166 = 44\), we find \(210 \equiv 44 \pmod{83}\). Therefore, the inverse of 17 modulo 83 is 44.

To verify, we compute \(17 \cdot 44 = 748\). Dividing 748 by 83 gives a remainder of 1, confirming \(748 \equiv 1 \pmod{83}\).

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{44}\).

so inverse of 2 mod83 is 42.
therefore, going back, the inverse of 17 mod83 is 5*42 mod83.

5*42 is 210.
now, 210 modulo 83: 83*2=166, so 210 -166=44.

let's see.
we can compute gcd(17,83).
since 83 is prime, the gcd is 1, and hence the inverse exists.
applying the euclidean algorithm:
83 = 17*4 + 15
17 = 15*1 + 2
15 = 2*7 + 1
2 = 1*2 + 0
so the gcd is 1.
now, tracing back:
1 = 15 - 2*7
but 2 = 17 - 15*1
so substituting back:
1 = 15 - (17 - 15*1)*7
= 15 -17*7 +15*7
= 15*8 -17*7
but 15 =83 -17*4 (from first step)
hence,
1 = (83 -17*4)*8 -17*7
=83*8 -17*32 -17*7
=83*8 -17*39
so, this gives:
1 = 83*8 -17*39
which implies:
-17*39 ≡1 mod83
hence, multiplying both sides by -1:
17*39 ≡-1 mod83
but i need 17*x ≡1 mod83, so x ≡39*(-1) mod83.
therefore, x= -39 mod83.
so, 83 -39=44.
so x=44.
hence, same result.
so this confirms that 44 is the inverse.
alternatively, if i had noticed that 17*5=85≡2 mod83, then as i initially thought, 17*5 ≡2 => multiply both sides by the inverse of 2 mod83, which is 42, so 17*(5*42)≡1 mod83.
so 5*42=210≡44 mod83.
so same answer.
so yeah, that works.
so the key steps were:
use the hint given (17*5=85).
realize 85≡2 mod83.
find the inverse of 2 mod83, which is 42.
multiply 5 by 42 and reduce mod83 to get 44.

answer: to compute \(17^{-1} \pmod{83}\), we need to find an integer \(x\) such that \(17x \equiv 1 \pmod{83}\). 

first, we use the hint that \(17 \cdot 5 = 85\). since \(85 \equiv 2 \pmod{83}\), we have \(17 \cdot 5 \equiv 2 \pmod{83}\). next, we need to find the inverse of 2 modulo 83. the inverse of 2 modulo 83 is a number \(y\) such that \(2y \equiv 1 \pmod{83}\). by testing values, we find that \(2 \cdot 42 = 84 \equiv 1 \pmod{83}\), so the inverse of 2 modulo 83 is 42.

multiplying both sides of the congruence \(17 \cdot 5 \equiv 2 \pmod{83}\) by 42, we get:
\[
17 \cdot 5 \cdot 42 \equiv 2 \cdot 42 \pmod{83}
\]
\[
17 \cdot 210 \equiv 84 \pmod{83}
\]
since \(84 \equiv 1 \pmod{83}\), we have:
\[
17 \cdot 210 \equiv 1 \pmod{83}
\]
next, we reduce \(210 \pmod{83}\). calculating \(210 - 2 \cdot 83 = 210 - 166 = 44\), we find \(210 \equiv 44 \pmod{83}\). therefore, the inverse of 17 modulo 83 is 44.

to verify, we compute \(17 \cdot 44 = 748\). dividing 748 by 83 gives a remainder of 1, confirming \(748 \equiv 1 \pmod{83}\).

thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{44}\)
