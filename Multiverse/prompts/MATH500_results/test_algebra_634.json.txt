Okay, so I need to solve this equation: (6r2 - 19r - 7)/(2r - 7) = 4r - 3. Hmm, let me think. I remember that when you have an equation with a rational expression like this, you can eliminate the denominator by multiplying both sides by the denominator, as long as the denominator isn't zero. So first, I should note that 2r - 7 ≠ 0, which means r ≠ 7/2. Got that. So, I'll multiply both sides by 2r - 7 to eliminate the denominator.

1: The expression (4r - 3)(2r - 7) is expanded by applying the distributive property. Multiplying the first terms, 4r * 2r, results in 8r^2. Multiplying the outer terms, 4r * (-7), gives -28r. Multiplying the inner terms, (-3) * 2r, yields -6r. Multiplying the last terms, (-3) * (-7), results in 21. Summing these individual products, 8r^2 - 28r - 6r + 21, produces the expanded form 8r^2 - 34r + 21.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The expanded expression 8r^2 - 34r + 21 is already in its simplified form.

<Conclusion>
The expansion of (4r - 3)(2r - 7) is 8r^2 - 34r + 21, and this expression is already in its simplified form.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So after multiplying both sides by (2r - 7), the equation becomes: 6r2 - 19r - 7 = 8r2 - 34r + 21. Alright, now I need to simplify this equation. Let me move all terms to one side to set the equation to zero. I'll subtract the right side from both sides. So: (6r2 - 19r - 7) - (8r2 - 34r + 21) = 0 Let's think in parallel.

<Conclusion>
The coefficients of the r^2, r, and constant terms simplify to -2, 15, and -28, respectively.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So the equation becomes: -2r2 + 15r - 28 = 0. To make it neater, I can multiply both sides by -1: 2r2 - 15r + 28 = 0. Hmm, same equation, just multiplied by -1. Let me check if I can factor this. Looking for two numbers that multiply to (2)(28) = 56 and add up to -15. The possible factor pairs of 56 are: 1 & 56, 2 & 28, 4 & 14, 7 & 8. All with negative signs since the sum is -15. Let's see: Let's think in parallel.

<Conclusion>
The factor pair (-7, -8) sums to -15, and the factor pair (-4, -14) sums to -18.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Wait, -7 and -8 add up to -15. Yes! So then, split the middle term: 2r2 -7r -8r +28 = 0. Then group: (2r2 -7r) + (-8r +28) = 0. Factor each group: r(2r -7) -4(2r -7) = 0. Factor out the common term (2r -7): (2r -7)(r -4) = 0. So setting each factor to zero: 2r -7 = 0 → 2r=7 → r=7/2. But wait, earlier we noted that r ≠7/2 because that would make the original denominator zero. So even though this is a solution here, it's an extraneous solution because it's not in the domain of the original equation. So we can't accept that. The other factor is r -4 =0 → r=4. So is r=4 a valid solution? Let me check. Let's think in parallel.

<Path>
1: Substituting r=4 into the left side expression (6r^2 - 19r - 7)/(2r - 7) yields (6(4)^2 - 19(4) - 7)/(2(4) - 7), which simplifies to (6(16) - 76 - 7)/(8 - 7), then to (96 - 76 - 7)/1, and finally results in 13/1, or 13.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The right side of the original equation, 4r - 3, is evaluated at r=4, resulting in 4*4 - 3, which equals 16 - 3, or 13.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The substitution of r=4 into the original equation's left side results in a value of 13, and into the right side also results in a value of 13.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So left side equals right side. So r=4 is a valid solution. So the only valid solution is r=4. Therefore, the value of r is 4. Let me just double-check quickly. If r=4, original equation: Left side: (6(16) -19(4) -7)/ (8 -7) = (96 -76 -7)/1 = (13)/1 =13. Right side:4(4) -3=16-3=13. Perfect, matches. So yeah, r=4 is correct. The other root we got, r=7/2, but that's excluded because it makes the denominator zero. So when we multiplied both sides by (2r -7), we introduced that extraneous solution, so we need to check our solutions in the original equation. Good that I checked that. So final answer is 4.

Answer: To solve the equation \(\frac{6r^2 - 19r - 7}{2r - 7} = 4r - 3\), we start by eliminating the denominator by multiplying both sides by \(2r - 7\) (noting that \(r \neq \frac{7}{2}\)):

\[
6r^2 - 19r - 7 = (4r - 3)(2r - 7)
\]

Expanding the right side:

\[
(4r - 3)(2r - 7) = 8r^2 - 34r + 21
\]

Setting the equation to zero by moving all terms to one side:

\[
6r^2 - 19r - 7 - 8r^2 + 34r - 21 = 0
\]

Simplifying:

\[
-2r^2 + 15r - 28 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad 2r^2 - 15r + 28 = 0
\]

Factoring the quadratic equation:

\[
(2r - 7)(r - 4) = 0
\]

Solving for \(r\):

\[
2r - 7 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad r = \frac{7}{2} \quad (\text{extraneous solution})
\]
\[
r - 4 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad r = 4
\]

Verifying \(r = 4\) in the original equation:

Left side: \(\frac{6(4)^2 - 19(4) - 7}{2(4) - 7} = \frac{13}{1} = 13\)

Right side: \(4(4) - 3 = 13\)

Both sides match, confirming \(r = 4\) is the valid solution.

The final answer is \(\boxed{4}\).

verifying \(r = 4\) in the original equation:

left side: \(\frac{6(4)^2 - 19(4) - 7}{2(4) - 7} = \frac{13}{1} = 13\)
