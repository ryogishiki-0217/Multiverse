Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step.
So, the problem is to find the value of r that satisfies the equation:
(6r2 - 19r - 7) / (2r - 7) = 4r - 3
First, I need to make sure I understand what's being asked here.
We have a rational function on the left side, which is a quadratic polynomial divided by a linear polynomial, set equal to a linear expression on the right side.
We need to solve for r.
The first thought that comes to mind is to eliminate the denominator by multiplying both sides of the equation by (2r - 7).
But I remember that when multiplying equations by variables, especially when the variable is in the denominator, we have to be cautious about extraneous solutions.
So I should keep that in mind and check later if the solution makes the denominator zero.
But let me proceed step by step.
Starting with the given equation:
(6r2 - 19r - 7) / (2r - 7) = 4r - 3
Multiply both sides by (2r - 7):
6r2 - 19r - 7 = (4r - 3)(2r - 7)
Okay, so now I need to expand the right side.
Let me do that multiplication.
(4r - 3)(2r - 7)
First, multiply 4r by 2r: that's 8r2.
4r times -7: that's -28r.
-3 times 2r: that's -6r.
-3 times -7: that's +21.
So putting it all together:
8r2 -28r -6r +21 = 8r2 -34r +21
So the equation becomes:
6r2 -19r -7 = 8r2 -34r +21
Now, let's move all terms to the left side to set the equation to zero.
Subtracting the right side from both sides:
6r2 -19r -7 -8r2 +34r -21 = 0
Let's combine like terms:
(6r2 -8r2) + (-19r +34r) + (-7 -21) = 0
Simplifying each term:
-2r2 +15r -28 = 0
So now we have the quadratic equation: -2r2 +15r -28 = 0
Let me write that as:
2r2 -15r +28 = 0
Wait, I can multiply both sides by -1 to make the leading coefficient positive.
That gives: 2r2 -15r +28 = 0
Okay, now we have a standard quadratic equation.
Let me check if this quadratic factors easily.
We need two numbers that multiply to (2*28)=56 and add up to -15.
Let's think: factors of 56: 1*56, 2*28, 4*14, 7*8.
Since we need them to multiply to 56 and add to -15, both factors should be negative.
Let's check possible pairs:
-1 and -56: sum -57
-2 and -28: sum -30
-4 and -14: sum -18
-7 and -8: sum -15
Ah! -7 and -8 multiply to 56 and add to -15.
So yes, we can split the middle term using -7r and -8r.
So the quadratic 2r2 -15r +28 can be factored as:
2r2 -7r -8r +28
Wait, no. Let me use the factoring by grouping method.
First, we have 2r2 -15r +28.
Let me rewrite the middle term as -7r -8r:
2r2 -7r -8r +28
Then group the terms:
(2r2 -7r) + (-8r +28)
Factor out the GCF from each group:
r(2r -7) -4(2r -7)
Now, both terms have a (2r -7) factor, so factor that out:
(r -4)(2r -7) = 0
So the quadratic factors as (r -4)(2r -7)=0
Setting each factor equal to zero:
r -4 = 0 => r = 4
2r -7 = 0 => 2r =7 => r = 7/2
So the solutions are r=4 and r=7/2.
But wait, we need to check if these solutions make the original denominator zero.
The original equation has denominator (2r -7).
Let's check:
For r=4: 2*4 -7 = 8 -7 =1 ≠0.
For r=7/2: 2*(7/2) -7 =7 -7=0.
Oh! So r=7/2 makes the denominator zero, which means it's an extraneous solution.
Therefore, even though we got r=7/2 as a solution to the quadratic equation, it can't be valid for the original equation because it would make the denominator zero.
So the only valid solution is r=4.
Let me verify this by plugging back into the original equation.
Let's test r=4:
Left side: (6*(4)^2 -19*4 -7)/(2*4 -7) = (6*16 -76 -7)/(8 -7) = (96 -76 -7)/1 = (14)/1 =14
Right side: 4*4 -3 =16 -3=13
Wait, 14 ≠13?
That's odd.
Wait, that can't be.
But if r=4 is the solution, then plugging in should make both sides equal.
But here, when r=4, left side is 14, right side is 13.
Hmm.
There must be a mistake here.
Wait a minute, so where is the error?
Wait, maybe when I multiplied both sides by (2r -7), which is zero when r=7/2, but r=4 gives 1 as the multiplier.
However, when solving, we obtained r=4 and r=7/2, but 7/2 is extraneous.
However, when substituting back r=4, the left side is 14, the right side is 13.
That suggests that even the solution r=4 is not actually working.
Hmmm.
That means there must be an error in my calculations.
Let me check my steps again carefully.
Original equation:
(6r2 -19r -7)/(2r -7) =4r -3
Multiply both sides by (2r -7):
6r2 -19r -7 = (4r -3)(2r -7)
Calculating the right side:
(4r)(2r) + (4r)(-7) + (-3)(2r) + (-3)(-7) =8r2 -28r -6r +21=8r2 -34r +21
So right side is 8r2 -34r +21
Therefore, subtract the right side from both sides to get:
6r2 -19r -7 -8r2 +34r -21=0
Combine like terms:
(6r2 -8r2) + (-19r +34r) + (-7 -21) = -2r2 +15r -28=0
Multiply both sides by -1:
2r2 -15r +28=0
Then factored into (r -4)(2r -7)=0.
So that's correct.
So solving that gives roots at r=4 and r=7/2.
But when plugging r=4 back into original equation, get left side=14, right side=13.
Hmmm.
So there's a discrepancy here.
Wait, that suggests that either there is a miscalculation somewhere, or perhaps the problem is set up in a way where both solutions are extraneous, which seems unlikely.
Wait, so let's check calculations again.
Original equation:
Left side: (6r2 -19r -7)/(2r -7).
Dividing the quadratic by the linear factor.
Wait, perhaps the quadratic can be factored, and then divided by (2r -7), thus simplifying.
Let me try to factor 6r2 -19r -7.
Trying to factor 6r2 -19r -7.
We need two numbers that multiply to 6*(-7)= -42 and add to -19.
Possible factors of -42: Let's think: 1*(-42), -1*42, 2*(-21), -2*21, 3*(-14), -3*14, 6*(-7), -6*7, etc.
Looking for two numbers multiplying to -42 and adding to -19.
Let's see: How about -21 and 2.
Because -21 * 2 = -42, and -21 + 2 = -19.
Yes!
So we can write -19r as -21r +2r.
So 6r2 -21r +2r -7.
Then factor by grouping:
3r(2r -7) +1(2r -7) = (3r +1)(2r -7)
Oh, nice!
So the numerator factors as (3r +1)(2r -7).
Therefore, the original expression is [(3r +1)(2r -7)] / (2r -7).
Therefore, for all r ≠7/2, the (2r -7) cancels out, leaving us with 3r +1.
Therefore, the original equation simplifies to 3r +1 =4r -3, for r ≠7/2.
Then, solving 3r +1 =4r -3:
Subtract 3r from both sides: 1 =r -3
Add 3 to both sides: 4 =r
So r=4.
But wait, when we canceled out (2r -7), we assumed r ≠7/2, which is valid.
So then r=4 is the solution.
But when we substitute r=4 into the original equation, left side is (6*16 -19*4 -7)/ (8-7)= (96 -76 -7)/1=(14)/1=14.
The right side is 4*4 -3=13.
14 ≠13.
Wait, this is very confusing.
So either the simplification is wrong, but how?
Wait, if the numerator factors as (3r +1)(2r -7), and we cancel (2r -7), then the simplified equation is 3r +1 =4r -3.
But solving that gives r=4, but then substituting back into original equation gives 14=13, which is false.
So what's going on here?
Wait, perhaps when we cancel the (2r -7), we are changing the equation into a different one.
Wait, if the original equation is [ (3r +1)(2r -7) ] / (2r -7) =4r -3.
Then, for r ≠7/2, this simplifies to 3r +1 =4r -3.
But when we solve that, we get r=4, but when substituting back into original equation, it doesn't work.
That suggests that the simplification step is losing some context.
Wait, but how?
Alternatively, if the equation reduces to 3r +1 =4r -3, then r=4.
But substituting into original equation gives 14=13.
Therefore, that suggests there is no solution.
Wait, but when we solved after factoring, we got r=4 as a solution, but it doesn't work.
So the only possibility is that somewhere there's an error in the problem statement, or maybe in the simplification process.
Wait, maybe when we factor the numerator as (3r +1)(2r -7), is that correct?
Let me double-check.
Let's expand (3r +1)(2r -7):
3r*2r=6r2, 3r*(-7)= -21r, 1*2r=2r, 1*(-7)=-7.
So 6r2 -21r +2r -7=6r2 -19r -7.
Yes, that's correct.
So the numerator does factor as (3r +1)(2r -7).
Therefore, the original equation becomes:
[(3r +1)(2r -7)] / (2r -7) =4r -3
So for r ≠7/2, we can cancel (2r -7), leading to:
3r +1 =4r -3
Solving gives:
3r +1 =4r -3
Subtract 3r from both sides:
1 =r -3
Add 3 to both sides:
4 =r
So r=4.
But wait, then substituting back into original equation:
Left side: [6*(4)^2 -19*4 -7]/[2*4 -7] = (6*16 -76 -7)/(8 -7)=(96 -76 -7)/1=(14)/1=14
Right side:4*4 -3=16 -3=13
14 ≠13.
So where is the mistake here?
Wait, so the equation reduces to 3r +1=4r -3, which gives r=4, but when substituting back into the original equation, it doesn't hold.
That suggests that the cancellation step is invalid.
But why?
Wait, unless the original equation is [(3r +1)(2r -7)] / (2r -7) =4r -3, which simplifies to 3r +1 =4r -3 for 2r -7 ≠0.
However, when we solved it, we got r=4, but when plugging back into original equation, the left side equals 14, and the right side equals 13.
So there's inconsistency here.
Wait, so why does the cancellation lead us to an incorrect solution?
That suggests that maybe when we cancel the (2r -7) terms, we are altering the equation in a way that introduces an extraneous solution or removes the correct solution.
Wait, but how?
Let me think.
If we have [(3r +1)(2r -7)] / (2r -7) =4r -3, then for r ≠7/2, this simplifies to 3r +1 =4r -3.
But solving that gives r=4.
But when we substitute r=4 into the simplified equation, 3r +1=4r -3 becomes 12 +1=16 -3 →13=13, which is correct.
But substituting into the original equation gives 14=13, which is incorrect.
So how did the simplified equation give us a solution that doesn't work in the original equation.
Wait, but that would imply that the simplification is losing some aspect.
Wait, perhaps when we cancel (2r -7), we are assuming that (2r -7) is not zero, but we are not changing the equation in a way that would introduce an extraneous solution.
Wait, but in the original equation, when you have [(3r +1)(2r -7)] / (2r -7) =4r -3, for r ≠7/2, this is equal to 3r +1=4r -3.
Therefore, the solution to this should satisfy both equations.
But when we solve 3r +1=4r -3, we get r=4.
But substituting into the original equation, we get 14=13, which is a contradiction.
Therefore, does that mean that even though the simplified equation gives r=4, which is not a solution to the original equation?
If that's the case, then the original equation would have no solution.
But wait, that seems strange.
Wait, perhaps when we cancel the (2r -7) term, we are effectively changing the equation, but in reality, the original equation already has the domain restricted by the denominator.
So in the original equation, r cannot be 7/2.
But when we cancel the denominator, we are removing that discontinuity, which is leading us to a different equation.
So the equation 3r +1=4r -3 is a different equation from the original one.
The solution to this equation, r=4, may not satisfy the original equation because the cancellation process can alter the solutions.
Wait, but in standard algebraic steps, if you multiply or divide both sides by a non-zero number, which (2r -7) is when r≠7/2, the equation should be equivalent.
But in this case, the act of cancelling (2r -7) is leading us to a different equation with a different solution.
But how?
Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the original problem.
Let me check the original problem statement again.
The user wrote:
Find the value of r such that (6r2 -19r -7)/(2r -7) =4r -3
Yes, that's correct.
So, proceeding with the fact that after cancellation, the equation simplifies to 3r +1=4r -3, but when substituting back, we get 14=13.
So there is a contradiction.
Therefore, the only possible conclusion is that there is no solution.
But how?
Wait, the original equation is equivalent to 3r +1=4r -3 when 2r -7 ≠0.
However, solving 3r +1=4r -3 gives r=4, but substituting back into the original equation gives 14=13, which is false.
Therefore, even though the simplified equation gives r=4, this value does not satisfy the original equation.
Therefore, the original equation has no solution.
But that's conflicting with the factorization, which seems sound.
Wait, let me think again.
If 6r2 -19r -7 factors into (3r +1)(2r -7), that's correct.
So the original equation is [(3r +1)(2r -7)]/(2r -7)=4r -3.
Therefore, for all r ≠7/2, this simplifies to 3r +1=4r -3.
However, solving 3r +1=4r -3 gives r=4.
But when we substitute r=4 into the original equation, we get Left Side=14 and Right Side=13.
So this suggests that even though algebraically we simplified the equation, the solution obtained does not satisfy the original equation.
Therefore, is the conclusion that there is no solution?
But that seems counterintuitive, because when we solved the simplified equation, we got a solution, but it doesn't work in the original equation.
Therefore, the error might be in the initial problem setup.
Alternatively, maybe there was a miscalculation in the factorization.
Let me check the factorization once more.
Numerator:6r2 -19r -7.
Trying to factor this:
We can use the quadratic formula to find roots.
For 6r2 -19r -7=0.
Discriminant D = (-19)^2 +4*6*7=361 +168=529=23^2.
So roots are [19 ±23]/(2*6)=[42/12 or -4/12]=[7/2 or -1/6].
Therefore, factors are (3r +1)(2r -7).
Yes, because roots are -1/3 and 7/2, so (r +1/3)(2r -7)= (3r +1)/3*(2r -7).
Multiply by 3 to get (3r +1)(2r -7).
So yes, that's correct.
Therefore, the factorization is correct.
So the original equation is indeed [(3r +1)(2r -7)]/(2r -7) =4r -3.
Therefore, for r ≠7/2, this simplifies to 3r +1=4r -3, leading to r=4.
But when r=4, substituting back into the original equation gives 14=13, which is false.
Therefore, the conclusion is that there is no solution.
But that contradicts the factorization.
Wait, unless there was an error in assuming the original equation is equivalent to the simplified equation.
Wait, the equations are equivalent only if we don't include r=7/2.
But when we solve the simplified equation, we get r=4, which is not equal to7/2, so the restriction is still valid.
So the simplified equation should have the same solutions as the original equation, except for r=7/2, which is excluded.
But in this case, the solution to the simplified equation is r=4, but substituting into the original equation, it doesn't hold.
So that implies that the original equation has no solution.
But this is perplexing.
Wait, let's check when r=4, the left side is (6*16 -19*4 -7)/ (8 -7)= (96 -76 -7)/1=13/1=13.
Wait, wait, original equation numerator:
6r2 -19r -7.
For r=4:
6*(16) -19*4 -7=96 -76 -7=13.
Denominator:2*4 -7=8 -7=1.
So left side is 13/1=13.
Right side is4*4 -3=13.
So 13=13.
Wait, that was my mistake earlier.
Wait, when r=4, numerator is 6*16 -19*4 -7=96 -76=20 -7=13.
Denominator is 1.
So left side is 13.
Right side is13.
So 13=13.
So that works.
But earlier, when I calculated, I thought the numerator was 96 -76 -7=13, because 96 -76=20, 20 -7=13.
But I must have had a brain fog earlier.
So when r=4, left side is 13, right side is13.
So they are equal.
Therefore, r=4 is indeed a solution.
But earlier, when I thought left side was 14, that was incorrect.
So apologies for that miscalculation.
Therefore, the correct solution is r=4.
So when r=4, both sides equal13, so it's correct.
Then, the other solution r=7/2 is extraneous because it makes the denominator zero.
Therefore, the only valid solution is r=4.
Therefore, after careful calculation, the mistake earlier was in arithmetic when substituting r=4 into the original equation.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: The value of the left side of the original equation when r=4.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: The value of the right side of the original equation when r=4.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The left side of the original equation, evaluated at r=4, is computed as (6*(4)^2 - 19*4 - 7) / (2*4 - 7), which simplifies to (6*16 - 76 - 7) / (8 - 7), then to (96 - 76 - 7) / 1, and finally results in 13/1 = 13.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The right side of the original equation, 4r-3, evaluates to 13 when r=4.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
When r=4, the value of the left side is 13, and the value of the right side is 13.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Therefore, r=4 is indeed the correct solution.
So the answer is r=4.
But why when I simplified the quadratic equation I got two solutions, r=4 and r=7/2, but 7/2 is extraneous, and 4 is valid.
Therefore, even though the quadratic equation had two solutions, one was extraneous.
Therefore, the final answer is r=4.
**Final Answer**
The final answer is \boxed{4}.
</Think>

Answer: To solve the equation \(\frac{6r^2 - 19r - 7}{2r - 7} = 4r - 3\), we start by factoring the numerator \(6r^2 - 19r - 7\). 

We factor \(6r^2 - 19r - 7\) as \((3r + 1)(2r - 7)\). This allows us to rewrite the equation as:
\[
\frac{(3r + 1)(2r - 7)}{2r - 7} = 4r - 3
\]

For \(r \neq \frac{7}{2}\), we can cancel the common factor \(2r - 7\) from the numerator and the denominator, simplifying the equation to:
\[
3r + 1 = 4r - 3
\]

Next, we solve for \(r\) by isolating the variable. Subtract \(3r\) from both sides:
\[
1 = r - 3
\]

Add 3 to both sides:
\[
4 = r
\]

We must verify that this solution does not make the denominator zero. Substituting \(r = 4\) into the denominator \(2r - 7\), we get:
\[
2(4) - 7 = 8 - 7 = 1 \neq 0
\]

Thus, \(r = 4\) is a valid solution. Substituting \(r = 4\) back into the original equation, we verify both sides:
- Left side: \(\frac{6(4)^2 - 19(4) - 7}{2(4) - 7} = \frac{96 - 76 - 7}{1} = 13\)
- Right side: \(4(4) - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13\)

Both sides are equal, confirming our solution. The other potential solution \(r = \frac{7}{2}\) is extraneous as it makes the denominator zero.

The final answer is \(\boxed{4}\).

<think>
okay, let's tackle this problem step by step.
so, the problem is to find the value of r that satisfies the equation:
(6r2 - 19r - 7) / (2r - 7) = 4r - 3
first, i need to make sure i understand what's being asked here.
we have a rational function on the left side, which is a quadratic polynomial divided by a linear polynomial, set equal to a linear expression on the right side.
we need to solve for r.
the first thought that comes to mind is to eliminate the denominator by multiplying both sides of the equation by (2r - 7).
but i remember that when multiplying equations by variables, especially when the variable is in the denominator, we have to be cautious about extraneous solutions.
so i should keep that in mind and check later if the solution makes the denominator zero.
but let me proceed step by step.
starting with the given equation:
(6r2 - 19r - 7) / (2r - 7) = 4r - 3
multiply both sides by (2r - 7):
6r2 - 19r - 7 = (4r - 3)(2r - 7)
okay, so now i need to expand the right side.
let me do that multiplication.
(4r - 3)(2r - 7)
first, multiply 4r by 2r: that's 8r2.
4r times -7: that's -28r.
-3 times 2r: that's -6r.
-3 times -7: that's +21.
so putting it all together:
8r2 -28r -6r +21 = 8r2 -34r +21
so the equation becomes:
6r2 -19r -7 = 8r2 -34r +21
now, let's move all terms to the left side to set the equation to zero.
subtracting the right side from both sides:
6r2 -19r -7 -8r2 +34r -21 = 0
let's combine like terms:
(6r2 -8r2) + (-19r +34r) + (-7 -21) = 0
simplifying each term:
-2r2 +15r -28 = 0
so now we have the quadratic equation: -2r2 +15r -28 = 0
let me write that as:
2r2 -15r +28 = 0
wait, i can multiply both sides by -1 to make the leading coefficient positive.
that gives: 2r2 -15r +28 = 0
okay, now we have a standard quadratic equation.
let me check if this quadratic factors easily.
we need two numbers that multiply to (2*28)=56 and add up to -15.
let's think: factors of 56: 1*56, 2*28, 4*14, 7*8.
since we need them to multiply to 56 and add to -15, both factors should be negative.
let's check possible pairs:
-1 and -56: sum -57
-2 and -28: sum -30
-4 and -14: sum -18
-7 and -8: sum -15
ah! -7 and -8 multiply to 56 and add to -15.
so yes, we can split the middle term using -7r and -8r.
so the quadratic 2r2 -15r +28 can be factored as:
2r2 -7r -8r +28
wait, no. let me use the factoring by grouping method.
first, we have 2r2 -15r +28.
let me rewrite the middle term as -7r -8r:
2r2 -7r -8r +28
then group the terms:
(2r2 -7r) + (-8r +28)
factor out the gcf from each group:
r(2r -7) -4(2r -7)
now, both terms have a (2r -7) factor, so factor that out:
(r -4)(2r -7) = 0
so the quadratic factors as (r -4)(2r -7)=0
setting each factor equal to zero:
r -4 = 0 => r = 4
2r -7 = 0 => 2r =7 => r = 7/2
so the solutions are r=4 and r=7/2.
but wait, we need to check if these solutions make the original denominator zero.
the original equation has denominator (2r -7).
let's check:
for r=4: 2*4 -7 = 8 -7 =1 ≠0.
for r=7/2: 2*(7/2) -7 =7 -7=0.
oh! so r=7/2 makes the denominator zero, which means it's an extraneous solution.
therefore, even though we got r=7/2 as a solution to the quadratic equation, it can't be valid for the original equation because it would make the denominator zero.
so the only valid solution is r=4.
let me verify this by plugging back into the original equation.
let's test r=4:
left side: (6*(4)^2 -19*4 -7)/(2*4 -7) = (6*16 -76 -7)/(8 -7) = (96 -76 -7)/1 = (14)/1 =14
right side: 4*4 -3 =16 -3=13
wait, 14 ≠13?
that's odd.
wait, that can't be.
but if r=4 is the solution, then plugging in should make both sides equal.
but here, when r=4, left side is 14, right side is 13.
hmm.
there must be a mistake here.
wait a minute, so where is the error?
wait, maybe when i multiplied both sides by (2r -7), which is zero when r=7/2, but r=4 gives 1 as the multiplier.
however, when solving, we obtained r=4 and r=7/2, but 7/2 is extraneous.
however, when substituting back r=4, the left side is 14, the right side is 13.
that suggests that even the solution r=4 is not actually working.
hmmm.
that means there must be an error in my calculations.
let me check my steps again carefully.
original equation:
(6r2 -19r -7)/(2r -7) =4r -3
multiply both sides by (2r -7):
6r2 -19r -7 = (4r -3)(2r -7)
calculating the right side:
(4r)(2r) + (4r)(-7) + (-3)(2r) + (-3)(-7) =8r2 -28r -6r +21=8r2 -34r +21
so right side is 8r2 -34r +21
therefore, subtract the right side from both sides to get:
6r2 -19r -7 -8r2 +34r -21=0
combine like terms:
(6r2 -8r2) + (-19r +34r) + (-7 -21) = -2r2 +15r -28=0
multiply both sides by -1:
2r2 -15r +28=0
then factored into (r -4)(2r -7)=0.
so that's correct.
so solving that gives roots at r=4 and r=7/2.
but when plugging r=4 back into original equation, get left side=14, right side=13.
hmmm.
so there's a discrepancy here.
wait, that suggests that either there is a miscalculation somewhere, or perhaps the problem is set up in a way where both solutions are extraneous, which seems unlikely.
wait, so let's check calculations again.
original equation:
left side: (6r2 -19r -7)/(2r -7).
dividing the quadratic by the linear factor.
wait, perhaps the quadratic can be factored, and then divided by (2r -7), thus simplifying.
let me try to factor 6r2 -19r -7.
trying to factor 6r2 -19r -7.
we need two numbers that multiply to 6*(-7)= -42 and add to -19.
possible factors of -42: let's think: 1*(-42), -1*42, 2*(-21), -2*21, 3*(-14), -3*14, 6*(-7), -6*7, etc.
looking for two numbers multiplying to -42 and adding to -19.
let's see: how about -21 and 2.
because -21 * 2 = -42, and -21 + 2 = -19.
yes!
so we can write -19r as -21r +2r.
so 6r2 -21r +2r -7.
then factor by grouping:
3r(2r -7) +1(2r -7) = (3r +1)(2r -7)
oh, nice!
so the numerator factors as (3r +1)(2r -7).
therefore, the original expression is [(3r +1)(2r -7)] / (2r -7).
therefore, for all r ≠7/2, the (2r -7) cancels out, leaving us with 3r +1.
therefore, the original equation simplifies to 3r +1 =4r -3, for r ≠7/2.
then, solving 3r +1 =4r -3:
subtract 3r from both sides: 1 =r -3
add 3 to both sides: 4 =r
so r=4.
but wait, when we canceled out (2r -7), we assumed r ≠7/2, which is valid.
so then r=4 is the solution.
but when we substitute r=4 into the original equation, left side is (6*16 -19*4 -7)/ (8-7)= (96 -76 -7)/1=(14)/1=14.
the right side is 4*4 -3=13.
14 ≠13.
wait, this is very confusing.
so either the simplification is wrong, but how?
wait, if the numerator factors as (3r +1)(2r -7), and we cancel (2r -7), then the simplified equation is 3r +1 =4r -3.
but solving that gives r=4, but then substituting back into original equation gives 14=13, which is false.
so what's going on here?
wait, perhaps when we cancel the (2r -7), we are changing the equation into a different one.
wait, if the original equation is [ (3r +1)(2r -7) ] / (2r -7) =4r -3.
then, for r ≠7/2, this simplifies to 3r +1 =4r -3.
but when we solve that, we get r=4, but when substituting back into original equation, it doesn't work.
that suggests that the simplification step is losing some context.
wait, but how?
alternatively, if the equation reduces to 3r +1 =4r -3, then r=4.
but substituting into original equation gives 14=13.
therefore, that suggests there is no solution.
wait, but when we solved after factoring, we got r=4 as a solution, but it doesn't work.
so the only possibility is that somewhere there's an error in the problem statement, or maybe in the simplification process.
wait, maybe when we factor the numerator as (3r +1)(2r -7), is that correct?
let me double-check.
let's expand (3r +1)(2r -7):
3r*2r=6r2, 3r*(-7)= -21r, 1*2r=2r, 1*(-7)=-7.
so 6r2 -21r +2r -7=6r2 -19r -7.
yes, that's correct.
so the numerator does factor as (3r +1)(2r -7).
therefore, the original equation becomes:
[(3r +1)(2r -7)] / (2r -7) =4r -3
so for r ≠7/2, we can cancel (2r -7), leading to:
3r +1 =4r -3
solving gives:
3r +1 =4r -3
subtract 3r from both sides:
1 =r -3
add 3 to both sides:
4 =r
so r=4.
but wait, then substituting back into original equation:
left side: [6*(4)^2 -19*4 -7]/[2*4 -7] = (6*16 -76 -7)/(8 -7)=(96 -76 -7)/1=(14)/1=14
right side:4*4 -3=16 -3=13
14 ≠13.
so where is the mistake here?
wait, so the equation reduces to 3r +1=4r -3, which gives r=4, but when substituting back into the original equation, it doesn't hold.
that suggests that the cancellation step is invalid.
but why?
wait, unless the original equation is [(3r +1)(2r -7)] / (2r -7) =4r -3, which simplifies to 3r +1 =4r -3 for 2r -7 ≠0.
however, when we solved it, we got r=4, but when plugging back into original equation, the left side equals 14, and the right side equals 13.
so there's inconsistency here.
wait, so why does the cancellation lead us to an incorrect solution?
that suggests that maybe when we cancel the (2r -7) terms, we are altering the equation in a way that introduces an extraneous solution or removes the correct solution.
wait, but how?
let me think.
if we have [(3r +1)(2r -7)] / (2r -7) =4r -3, then for r ≠7/2, this simplifies to 3r +1 =4r -3.
but solving that gives r=4.
but when we substitute r=4 into the simplified equation, 3r +1=4r -3 becomes 12 +1=16 -3 →13=13, which is correct.
but substituting into the original equation gives 14=13, which is incorrect.
so how did the simplified equation give us a solution that doesn't work in the original equation.
wait, but that would imply that the simplification is losing some aspect.
wait, perhaps when we cancel (2r -7), we are assuming that (2r -7) is not zero, but we are not changing the equation in a way that would introduce an extraneous solution.
wait, but in the original equation, when you have [(3r +1)(2r -7)] / (2r -7) =4r -3, for r ≠7/2, this is equal to 3r +1=4r -3.
therefore, the solution to this should satisfy both equations.
but when we solve 3r +1=4r -3, we get r=4.
but substituting into the original equation, we get 14=13, which is a contradiction.
therefore, does that mean that even though the simplified equation gives r=4, which is not a solution to the original equation?
if that's the case, then the original equation would have no solution.
but wait, that seems strange.
wait, perhaps when we cancel the (2r -7) term, we are effectively changing the equation, but in reality, the original equation already has the domain restricted by the denominator.
so in the original equation, r cannot be 7/2.
but when we cancel the denominator, we are removing that discontinuity, which is leading us to a different equation.
so the equation 3r +1=4r -3 is a different equation from the original one.
the solution to this equation, r=4, may not satisfy the original equation because the cancellation process can alter the solutions.
wait, but in standard algebraic steps, if you multiply or divide both sides by a non-zero number, which (2r -7) is when r≠7/2, the equation should be equivalent.
but in this case, the act of cancelling (2r -7) is leading us to a different equation with a different solution.
but how?
wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the original problem.
let me check the original problem statement again.
the user wrote:
find the value of r such that (6r2 -19r -7)/(2r -7) =4r -3
yes, that's correct.
so, proceeding with the fact that after cancellation, the equation simplifies to 3r +1=4r -3, but when substituting back, we get 14=13.
so there is a contradiction.
therefore, the only possible conclusion is that there is no solution.
but how?
wait, the original equation is equivalent to 3r +1=4r -3 when 2r -7 ≠0.
however, solving 3r +1=4r -3 gives r=4, but substituting back into the original equation gives 14=13, which is false.
therefore, even though the simplified equation gives r=4, this value does not satisfy the original equation.
therefore, the original equation has no solution.
but that's conflicting with the factorization, which seems sound.
wait, let me think again.
if 6r2 -19r -7 factors into (3r +1)(2r -7), that's correct.
so the original equation is [(3r +1)(2r -7)]/(2r -7)=4r -3.
therefore, for all r ≠7/2, this simplifies to 3r +1=4r -3.
however, solving 3r +1=4r -3 gives r=4.
but when we substitute r=4 into the original equation, we get left side=14 and right side=13.
so this suggests that even though algebraically we simplified the equation, the solution obtained does not satisfy the original equation.
therefore, is the conclusion that there is no solution?
but that seems counterintuitive, because when we solved the simplified equation, we got a solution, but it doesn't work in the original equation.
therefore, the error might be in the initial problem setup.
alternatively, maybe there was a miscalculation in the factorization.
let me check the factorization once more.
numerator:6r2 -19r -7.
trying to factor this:
we can use the quadratic formula to find roots.
for 6r2 -19r -7=0.
discriminant d = (-19)^2 +4*6*7=361 +168=529=23^2.
so roots are [19 ±23]/(2*6)=[42/12 or -4/12]=[7/2 or -1/6].
therefore, factors are (3r +1)(2r -7).
yes, because roots are -1/3 and 7/2, so (r +1/3)(2r -7)= (3r +1)/3*(2r -7).
multiply by 3 to get (3r +1)(2r -7).
so yes, that's correct.
therefore, the factorization is correct.
so the original equation is indeed [(3r +1)(2r -7)]/(2r -7) =4r -3.
therefore, for r ≠7/2, this simplifies to 3r +1=4r -3, leading to r=4.
but when r=4, substituting back into the original equation gives 14=13, which is false.
therefore, the conclusion is that there is no solution.
but that contradicts the factorization.
wait, unless there was an error in assuming the original equation is equivalent to the simplified equation.
wait, the equations are equivalent only if we don't include r=7/2.
but when we solve the simplified equation, we get r=4, which is not equal to7/2, so the restriction is still valid.
so the simplified equation should have the same solutions as the original equation, except for r=7/2, which is excluded.
but in this case, the solution to the simplified equation is r=4, but substituting into the original equation, it doesn't hold.
so that implies that the original equation has no solution.
but this is perplexing.
wait, let's check when r=4, the left side is (6*16 -19*4 -7)/ (8 -7)= (96 -76 -7)/1=13/1=13.
wait, wait, original equation numerator:
6r2 -19r -7.
for r=4:
6*(16) -19*4 -7=96 -76 -7=13.
denominator:2*4 -7=8 -7=1.
so left side is 13/1=13.
right side is4*4 -3=13.
so 13=13.
wait, that was my mistake earlier.
wait, when r=4, numerator is 6*16 -19*4 -7=96 -76=20 -7=13.
denominator is 1.
so left side is 13.
right side is13.
so 13=13.
so that works.
but earlier, when i calculated, i thought the numerator was 96 -76 -7=13, because 96 -76=20, 20 -7=13.
but i must have had a brain fog earlier.
so when r=4, left side is 13, right side is13.
so they are equal.
therefore, r=4 is indeed a solution.
but earlier, when i thought left side was 14, that was incorrect.
so apologies for that miscalculation.
therefore, the correct solution is r=4.
so when r=4, both sides equal13, so it's correct.
then, the other solution r=7/2 is extraneous because it makes the denominator zero.
therefore, the only valid solution is r=4.
therefore, after careful calculation, the mistake earlier was in arithmetic when substituting r=4 into the original equation.
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>
<goal>
<outline>
1: the value of the left side of the original equation when r=4.
</outline>
<outline>
2: the value of the right side of the original equation when r=4.
</outline>
</goal>
<path>
1: the left side of the original equation, evaluated at r=4, is computed as (6*(4)^2 - 19*4 - 7) / (2*4 - 7), which simplifies to (6*16 - 76 - 7) / (8 - 7), then to (96 - 76 - 7) / 1, and finally results in 13/1 = 13.
</path>
<path>
2: the right side of the original equation, 4r-3, evaluates to 13 when r=4.
</path>
<conclusion>
when r=4, the value of the left side is 13, and the value of the right side is 13.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
therefore, r=4 is indeed the correct solution.
so the answer is r=4.
but why when i simplified the quadratic equation i got two solutions, r=4 and r=7/2, but 7/2 is extraneous, and 4 is valid.
therefore, even though the quadratic equation had two solutions, one was extraneous.
therefore, the final answer is r=4.
**final answer**
the final answer is \boxed{4}.
</think>

answer: to solve the equation \(\frac{6r^2 - 19r - 7}{2r - 7} = 4r - 3\), we start by factoring the numerator \(6r^2 - 19r - 7\). 

we factor \(6r^2 - 19r - 7\) as \((3r + 1)(2r - 7)\). this allows us to rewrite the equation as:
\[
\frac{(3r + 1)(2r - 7)}{2r - 7} = 4r - 3
\]

for \(r \neq \frac{7}{2}\), we can cancel the common factor \(2r - 7\) from the numerator and the denominator, simplifying the equation to:
\[
3r + 1 = 4r - 3
\]

next, we solve for \(r\) by isolating the variable. subtract \(3r\) from both sides:
\[
1 = r - 3
\]

add 3 to both sides:
\[
4 = r
\]

we must verify that this solution does not make the denominator zero. substituting \(r = 4\) into the denominator \(2r - 7\), we get:
\[
2(4) - 7 = 8 - 7 = 1 \neq 0
\]

thus, \(r = 4\) is a valid solution. substituting \(r = 4\) back into the original equation, we verify both sides:
- left side: \(\frac{6(4)^2 - 19(4) - 7}{2(4) - 7} = \frac{96 - 76 - 7}{1} = 13\)
- right side: \(4(4) - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13\)

both sides are equal, confirming our solution. the other potential solution \(r = \frac{7}{2}\) is extraneous as it makes the denominator zero.

the final answer is \(\boxed{4}\)
