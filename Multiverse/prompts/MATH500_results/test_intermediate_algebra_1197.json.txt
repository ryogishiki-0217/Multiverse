<Think>
Okay, so I need to find the value of a 5th-degree polynomial p(x) at x=8, given that p(n) = n/(n2 -1) for n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
Hmm, let's see.
First off, p(x) is a polynomial of degree 5, and we know its values at six different points: 2 through 7.
But wait, if it's degree 5, then we usually need 6 points to uniquely determine it, right?
Because a degree 5 polynomial has 6 coefficients to solve for.
So, in this case, they are giving us p(n) for n=2 to 7, but the values are given by this formula n/(n2 -1).
Wait, but actually, they say p(x) is a polynomial of degree 5 such that p(n) = n/(n2 -1) for n=2,3,4,5,6,7.
So, they must have constructed the polynomial passing through these six points, and since a 5th-degree polynomial is uniquely determined by six points, this polynomial is unique.
Therefore, if we can find a way to interpolate this polynomial or find its coefficients, we can then compute p(8).
But maybe there's a smarter way than directly doing Lagrange interpolation or setting up a system of equations.
Let me think.
The problem gives p(n) = n/(n2 - 1) for n=2 to 7, and we need p(8).
Let me note that n/(n2 -1) can be simplified.
n2 -1 is (n-1)(n+1), so that's n/((n-1)(n+1)).
So, that's the value the polynomial takes at those integer points.
But working with polynomials, maybe there's a way to express this as a ratio of polynomials or use finite differences?
Hmm, 5th degree polynomial... Finite differences would require a lot of computations.
Maybe there's a clever approach here.
Wait, another thought: If p(x) is a polynomial of degree 5 such that p(n) = n/(n2 -1) for n=2,...,7, then consider the polynomial q(x) = p(x)(x2 -1) - x.
Wait, let's see: If we define q(x) = p(x)(x2 -1) - x, what's the degree of q(x)?
Let's think.
p(x) is degree 5, multiplied by (x2 -1) which is degree 2, so the product would be degree 7.
Then subtracting x, which is degree 1, so overall q(x) is degree 7.
But notice that for x = 2,3,4,5,6,7, p(x) = x/(x2 -1), so plugging into q(x), we get q(n) = [x/(x2 -1)]*(x2 -1) - x = x - x = 0.
So, q(n)=0 for n=2,3,4,5,6,7.
Therefore, q(x) is a polynomial of degree 7 that has roots at x=2,3,4,5,6,7.
So, we can write q(x) = (x-2)(x-3)(x-4)(x-5)(x-6)(x-7)r(x), where r(x) is another polynomial.
But since q(x) was of degree 7, and the product (x-2)...(x-7) is degree 6, so r(x) must be linear, right?
Let's check: (x-2)(x-3)...(x-7) is indeed degree 6, so multiplying by a linear term (degree 1) gives degree 7.
Therefore, r(x) must be a linear polynomial: r(x) = ax + b.
Hence, q(x) = (x-2)(x-3)(x-4)(x-5)(x-6)(x-7)(ax + b).
But recall that q(x) = p(x)(x2 -1) - x.
Therefore, for all x, this equation holds.
But we can use some specific values of x to solve for a and b.
Wait, that seems promising.
For example, if we can plug in some x values where q(x) is known, then we can solve for a and b.
But what x values can we plug in?
Well, since q(x) is defined for all x, but we know that q(x) has roots at 2 through 7.
But perhaps we can use other x values where we can compute q(x) in terms of p(x), if we can express p(x) such that q(x) can be evaluated.
Wait, but p(x) is only known at x=2,...,7.
However, q(x) is defined in terms of p(x), but if we can express p(x) from the equation: p(x) = [q(x) + x]/(x2 -1).
So, if we can write p(x) in terms of q(x), but since we also have that p(x) is a polynomial, and q(x) is given in terms of (x-2)...(x-7)(ax + b), perhaps this leads us to finding a and b.
But maybe plugging in other x values where we can compute q(x).
For example, perhaps x=1, x=0, or x=8?
Wait, but we need to find p(8), which requires knowing q(8).
But q(8) = p(8)(82 -1) -8 = p(8)*63 -8.
If we can find q(8), then we can solve for p(8).
But to compute q(8), we need to know what a and b are in the expression q(x) = (x-2)...(x-7)(ax + b).
So, the key is to find a and b.
To find a and b, we need two equations.
We can get these equations by plugging in two other x values where we can compute q(x) using the definition q(x) = p(x)(x2 -1) -x, but since we know p(x) for x=2 to 7, maybe use x=1 and x=0?
Wait, but for x=1: q(1) = p(1)(1 -1) -1 = -1.
Similarly, for x=0: q(0) = p(0)(0 -1) -0 = -p(0)*1.
But do we know p(1) or p(0)?
Wait, the problem only specifies p(n) for n=2 to 7.
So, at x=1 and x=0, p(x) is unknown, right?
Wait, but since p(x) is a degree 5 polynomial, defined for all x, but we only know its values at 2 through 7.
So, if we use x=1, q(1) = p(1)(0) -1 = -1.
Similarly, q(0) = p(0)(-1) -0 = -p(0).
But since we don't know p(0) or p(1), this might not be helpful.
Alternatively, maybe use x=-1?
Let's check: For x=-1, q(-1) = p(-1)((-1)^2 -1) - (-1) = p(-1)(1 -1) +1 = 0 +1 =1.
So, q(-1)=1.
Similarly, maybe other negative x values?
But perhaps x=1 and x=-1 are useful.
Let me check.
So, let's see:
At x=1: q(1) = (1-2)(1-3)...(1-7)(a*1 + b).
Calculating (1-2)(1-3)...(1-7).
Let's compute that.
(1-2) = -1, (1-3)=-2, (1-4)=-3, (1-5)=-4, (1-6)=-5, (1-7)=-6.
Multiplying these: (-1)*(-2)*(-3)*(-4)*(-5)*(-6) = (-1)^6 *6! = 720.
Therefore, q(1) = 720*(a + b).
But from before, q(1) = -1.
Therefore, 720*(a + b) = -1.
So, equation (1): 720(a + b) = -1.
Similarly, at x=-1: q(-1) = (-1-2)(-1-3)...(-1-7)(a*(-1) + b).
Let's compute (-1-2)= -3, (-1-3)= -4,..., (-1-7)= -8.
So, the product is (-3)*(-4)*(-5)*(-6)*(-7)*(-8).
The signs here: from -1-2 up to -1-7, that's 6 terms, each of which is negative, so the product will be (-1)^6 *3*4*5*6*7*8 = 720 * 56 (since 8! /2! = 40320 /2= 20160, no, wait 8*7*6*5*4*3= 720*56, right? 8!/2! = 40320 /2=20160. And 720*56=40320, which is 8!/2!. Hmm, 8*7*6*5*4*3=720*56. Yes, since 3*4*5*6*7*8=720*56/2? Wait, maybe better to compute:
-3*-4=12, *-5= -60, *-6=360, *-7= -2520, *-8=20160.
So product is 20160.
But the term also includes ( -a + b ).
So, q(-1) = 20160*(-a + b).
But earlier, we found q(-1) =1.
Therefore, 20160*(-a + b) =1.
So, equation (2): 20160*(-a + b) =1.
Now, we have two equations:
1) 720(a + b) = -1
2) 20160*(-a + b) =1
Let me write them as:
Equation 1: 720a + 720b = -1
Equation 2: -20160a + 20160b =1
Let me solve these equations.
First, simplify equation 1 by dividing both sides by 720:
a + b = -1/720
Similarly, equation 2: divide both sides by 20160:
(-a + b) =1/20160
So, now we have two equations:
1) a + b = -1/720
2) -a + b =1/20160
Let me add these two equations to eliminate a:
(1) + (2): (a + b) + (-a + b) = -1/720 +1/20160
Simplify left side: 2b = (-1/720) + (1/20160)
Find a common denominator.
720= 720, 20160=720*28.
So, common denominator is 20160.
Convert -1/720: (-1)*(28/20160) = -28/20160
So, 2b = (-28 +1)/20160 = (-27)/20160
Therefore, b= (-27)/(2*20160) = (-27)/40320.
Simplify that: 27 divides by 27, 40320 ÷27= 1493.333... Wait, 40320 ÷ 27: 40320 ÷ 9=4480, 4480 ÷3=1493.333... Hmm, maybe better to reduce fraction:
-27/40320. Divide numerator and denominator by 3: -9/13440.
Again divide by 3: -3/4480. Hmm, 4480= 32*140= 32*7*20= 32*7*4*5. Not sure. Let me check: 40320 ÷27: 40320 divided by 27 is equal to 1493.333..., but since 27 and 40320 have GCD of 3? Wait, 40320 ÷3=13440, which is still even. 40320=2^6 * 3^2 * 5 *7. Similarly, 27=3^3. So GCD(40320,27)=32=9. So, -27/40320 ÷ by 9= -3/4480. So, yes, b= -3/4480.
Then, from equation 1: a + b = -1/720, so a = -1/720 - b = -1/720 +3/4480.
Compute a: Let's find common denominator for 720 and 4480.
720=720, 4480=4480. Let's see. 4480 ÷720=6.222..., so not a multiple. Let's find LCM(720,4480).
Factorize both:
720= 2^4 *3^2 *5
4480=448*10=64*7*10=64*7*10=2^6 *5*7
So LCM is 2^6 *3^2 *5*7= 64 *9 *5*7=64*315=20160.
So common denominator is 20160.
Convert -1/720: 20160 ÷720=28, so -1/720= -28/20160
Convert 3/4480: 20160 ÷4480=4.5. Wait, 4480*4.5=20160. So 3/4480*4.5= 13.5/20160?
Wait, perhaps better:
3/4480 = x/20160
Then x=3*20160/4480=3*(20160/4480)=3*(4.5)=13.5.
So, 3/4480=13.5/20160.
So, a= -28/20160 +13.5/20160= (-28 +13.5)/20160= -14.5/20160.
Let me convert 14.5 to 29/2: -29/2 /20160= -29/(40320).
Therefore, a= -29/40320.
So, a= -29/40320 and b= -3/4480.
Wait, let me check the calculations again.
Compute a: a= -1/720 +3/4480.
Convert to common denominator.
Let me compute 1/720 = 1/(720), 3/4480=3/(4480).
LCM of 720 and 4480 is 40320 as above.
So, 1/720=56/40320 (since 40320/720=56).
Similarly, 3/4480: 40320/4480=9.
So, 3/4480=3*9/40320=27/40320.
Therefore, a= -56/40320 +27/40320= (-56 +27)/40320= -29/40320.
Similarly, b from equation 1: a + b= -1/720.
So, b= -1/720 -a= -1/720 +29/40320.
Convert again: 1/720=56/40320, so 56/40320 -29/40320= (56 -29)/40320=27/40320.
Wait, but sign is wrong.
Wait: b= -1/720 -a => no, wait:
Wait, a + b = -1/720.
Therefore, b= -1/720 -a.
So, substituting a= -29/40320:
b= -56/40320 - (-29/40320)= -56/40320 +29/40320= -27/40320.
Which is the same as -3/4480:
Since 40320 ÷4480=9, so -27/40320= -3/4480.
Correct.
So, a= -29/40320 and b= -27/40320.
Alternatively, factoring out 1/40320:
a= -29/40320, b= -27/40320.
So, a and b are fractions with denominator 40320.
Now, we have q(x)= (x-2)(x-3)...(x-7)(ax +b).
So, q(x)= (x-2)(x-3)(x-4)(x-5)(x-6)(x-7)* ( (-29/40320)x -27/40320 ).
Factor out -1/40320: q(x)= (x-2)(x-3)...(x-7)* (-1/40320)*(29x +27).
Hmm, interesting.
But perhaps we don't need to write it like that.
Now, the ultimate goal is to compute p(8).
Let's recall that q(8)= p(8)*(82 -1) -8= p(8)*63 -8.
So, if we can compute q(8), then solve for p(8).
So, compute q(8)= (8-2)(8-3)(8-4)(8-5)(8-6)(8-7)*(a*8 +b).
So, compute (6)(5)(4)(3)(2)(1)* ( (-29/40320)*8 -27/40320 ).
Compute the product first: 6*5=30, 30*4=120, 120*3=360, 360*2=720, 720*1=720.
So, 720*( (-29*8 -27)/40320 ).
Compute numerator: -29*8= -232, so -232 -27= -259.
Thus, q(8)=720*( -259/40320 ).
Simplify: 720/40320 =1/56.
So, 1/56 * (-259)= -259/56.
Simplify: 259 ÷7=37, 56 ÷7=8.
So, -259/56= -37/8.
Therefore, q(8)= -37/8.
But q(8)=63p(8) -8.
Therefore: 63p(8) -8 = -37/8.
Solve for p(8): 63p(8)= -37/8 +8= (-37 +64)/8=27/8.
So, p(8)= (27/8)/63= (27/8)*(1/63)= (27/504)= (27 ÷9)/(504 ÷9)=3/56.
Therefore, p(8)=3/56.
Wait, let me check the calculation steps again.
So, after finding q(8)= -37/8, then:
q(8)=63p(8) -8.
Hence, 63p(8)= q(8) +8= (-37/8)+8= (-37 +64)/8=27/8.
Therefore, p(8)= (27/8)/63= multiply by 1/63: 27/(8*63).
But 27/63=3/7.
So, 3/(8*7)=3/56.
Yes, correct.
Therefore, p(8)=3/56.
Wait, but let me check once again.
q(x)= (x-2)(x-3)...(x-7)(ax +b).
Then, at x=8, the product (8-2)...(8-7)=6*5*4*3*2*1=720.
Then times (a*8 +b).
Computed a*8 +b= (-29/40320)*8 -27/40320= (-232 -27)/40320= -259/40320.
Multiply by 720: 720*(-259/40320)= (-259*720)/40320.
Simplify: 720/40320=1/56, so it's -259/56= -37/8.
Correct.
Then, q(8)= -37/8.
Then, q(8)=63p(8)-8.
So, 63p(8)= q(8)+8= -37/8 +8= (-37 +64)/8=27/8.
Therefore, p(8)=27/(8*63)=27/(504)=3/56.
Yes.
Therefore, p(8)=3/56.
So, the final answer is \boxed{\dfrac{3}{56}}.
**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{3}{56}}

Answer: Given a polynomial \( p(x) \) of degree 5 such that \( p(n) = \frac{n}{n^2 - 1} \) for \( n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \), we need to find \( p(8) \).

First, we define a polynomial \( q(x) = p(x)(x^2 - 1) - x \). This polynomial \( q(x) \) is of degree 7 and has roots at \( x = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \). Therefore, we can write \( q(x) \) as:
\[
q(x) = (x-2)(x-3)(x-4)(x-5)(x-6)(x-7)(ax + b)
\]
for some constants \( a \) and \( b \).

Using the definition of \( q(x) \), we know:
\[
q(1) = p(1)(0) - 1 = -1 \quad \text{and} \quad q(-1) = p(-1)(0) + 1 = 1
\]

Calculating the product of the roots for \( q(1) \) and \( q(-1) \):
\[
q(1) = (1-2)(1-3)(1-4)(1-5)(1-6)(1-7)(a \cdot 1 + b) = 720(a + b) = -1
\]
\[
q(-1) = (-1-2)(-1-3)(-1-4)(-1-5)(-1-6)(-1-7)(a \cdot (-1) + b) = 20160(-a + b) = 1
\]

Solving the system of equations:
\[
720(a + b) = -1
\]
\[
20160(-a + b) = 1
\]

We simplify these equations:
1. \( a + b = -\frac{1}{720} \)
2. \( -a + b = \frac{1}{20160} \)

Solving these equations, we find:
\[
a = -\frac{29}{40320} \quad \text{and} \quad b = -\frac{27}{40320}
\]

Next, we compute \( q(8) \):
\[
q(8) = (8-2)(8-3)(8-4)(8-5)(8-6)(8-7)(8a + b)
\]
\[
= 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 \left(8 \left(-\frac{29}{40320}\right) - \frac{27}{40320}\right)
\]
\[
= 720 \left(\frac{-232 - 27}{40320}\right) = 720 \left(\frac{-259}{40320}\right) = -\frac{37}{8}
\]

Using \( q(8) = 63p(8) - 8 \):
\[
63p(8) - 8 = -\frac{37}{8}
\]
\[
63p(8) = \frac{27}{8}
\]
\[
p(8) = \frac{27}{8 \cdot 63} = \frac{3}{56}
\]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\dfrac{3}{56}}
\]

<think>
okay, so i need to find the value of a 5th-degree polynomial p(x) at x=8, given that p(n) = n/(n2 -1) for n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
hmm, let's see.
first off, p(x) is a polynomial of degree 5, and we know its values at six different points: 2 through 7.
but wait, if it's degree 5, then we usually need 6 points to uniquely determine it, right?
because a degree 5 polynomial has 6 coefficients to solve for.
so, in this case, they are giving us p(n) for n=2 to 7, but the values are given by this formula n/(n2 -1).
wait, but actually, they say p(x) is a polynomial of degree 5 such that p(n) = n/(n2 -1) for n=2,3,4,5,6,7.
so, they must have constructed the polynomial passing through these six points, and since a 5th-degree polynomial is uniquely determined by six points, this polynomial is unique.
therefore, if we can find a way to interpolate this polynomial or find its coefficients, we can then compute p(8).
but maybe there's a smarter way than directly doing lagrange interpolation or setting up a system of equations.
let me think.
the problem gives p(n) = n/(n2 - 1) for n=2 to 7, and we need p(8).
let me note that n/(n2 -1) can be simplified.
n2 -1 is (n-1)(n+1), so that's n/((n-1)(n+1)).
so, that's the value the polynomial takes at those integer points.
but working with polynomials, maybe there's a way to express this as a ratio of polynomials or use finite differences?
hmm, 5th degree polynomial... finite differences would require a lot of computations.
maybe there's a clever approach here.
wait, another thought: if p(x) is a polynomial of degree 5 such that p(n) = n/(n2 -1) for n=2,...,7, then consider the polynomial q(x) = p(x)(x2 -1) - x.
wait, let's see: if we define q(x) = p(x)(x2 -1) - x, what's the degree of q(x)?
let's think.
p(x) is degree 5, multiplied by (x2 -1) which is degree 2, so the product would be degree 7.
then subtracting x, which is degree 1, so overall q(x) is degree 7.
but notice that for x = 2,3,4,5,6,7, p(x) = x/(x2 -1), so plugging into q(x), we get q(n) = [x/(x2 -1)]*(x2 -1) - x = x - x = 0.
so, q(n)=0 for n=2,3,4,5,6,7.
therefore, q(x) is a polynomial of degree 7 that has roots at x=2,3,4,5,6,7.
so, we can write q(x) = (x-2)(x-3)(x-4)(x-5)(x-6)(x-7)r(x), where r(x) is another polynomial.
but since q(x) was of degree 7, and the product (x-2)...(x-7) is degree 6, so r(x) must be linear, right?
let's check: (x-2)(x-3)...(x-7) is indeed degree 6, so multiplying by a linear term (degree 1) gives degree 7.
therefore, r(x) must be a linear polynomial: r(x) = ax + b.
hence, q(x) = (x-2)(x-3)(x-4)(x-5)(x-6)(x-7)(ax + b).
but recall that q(x) = p(x)(x2 -1) - x.
therefore, for all x, this equation holds.
but we can use some specific values of x to solve for a and b.
wait, that seems promising.
for example, if we can plug in some x values where q(x) is known, then we can solve for a and b.
but what x values can we plug in?
well, since q(x) is defined for all x, but we know that q(x) has roots at 2 through 7.
but perhaps we can use other x values where we can compute q(x) in terms of p(x), if we can express p(x) such that q(x) can be evaluated.
wait, but p(x) is only known at x=2,...,7.
however, q(x) is defined in terms of p(x), but if we can express p(x) from the equation: p(x) = [q(x) + x]/(x2 -1).
so, if we can write p(x) in terms of q(x), but since we also have that p(x) is a polynomial, and q(x) is given in terms of (x-2)...(x-7)(ax + b), perhaps this leads us to finding a and b.
but maybe plugging in other x values where we can compute q(x).
for example, perhaps x=1, x=0, or x=8?
wait, but we need to find p(8), which requires knowing q(8).
but q(8) = p(8)(82 -1) -8 = p(8)*63 -8.
if we can find q(8), then we can solve for p(8).
but to compute q(8), we need to know what a and b are in the expression q(x) = (x-2)...(x-7)(ax + b).
so, the key is to find a and b.
to find a and b, we need two equations.
we can get these equations by plugging in two other x values where we can compute q(x) using the definition q(x) = p(x)(x2 -1) -x, but since we know p(x) for x=2 to 7, maybe use x=1 and x=0?
wait, but for x=1: q(1) = p(1)(1 -1) -1 = -1.
similarly, for x=0: q(0) = p(0)(0 -1) -0 = -p(0)*1.
but do we know p(1) or p(0)?
wait, the problem only specifies p(n) for n=2 to 7.
so, at x=1 and x=0, p(x) is unknown, right?
wait, but since p(x) is a degree 5 polynomial, defined for all x, but we only know its values at 2 through 7.
so, if we use x=1, q(1) = p(1)(0) -1 = -1.
similarly, q(0) = p(0)(-1) -0 = -p(0).
but since we don't know p(0) or p(1), this might not be helpful.
alternatively, maybe use x=-1?
let's check: for x=-1, q(-1) = p(-1)((-1)^2 -1) - (-1) = p(-1)(1 -1) +1 = 0 +1 =1.
so, q(-1)=1.
similarly, maybe other negative x values?
but perhaps x=1 and x=-1 are useful.
let me check.
so, let's see:
at x=1: q(1) = (1-2)(1-3)...(1-7)(a*1 + b).
calculating (1-2)(1-3)...(1-7).
let's compute that.
(1-2) = -1, (1-3)=-2, (1-4)=-3, (1-5)=-4, (1-6)=-5, (1-7)=-6.
multiplying these: (-1)*(-2)*(-3)*(-4)*(-5)*(-6) = (-1)^6 *6! = 720.
therefore, q(1) = 720*(a + b).
but from before, q(1) = -1.
therefore, 720*(a + b) = -1.
so, equation (1): 720(a + b) = -1.
similarly, at x=-1: q(-1) = (-1-2)(-1-3)...(-1-7)(a*(-1) + b).
let's compute (-1-2)= -3, (-1-3)= -4,..., (-1-7)= -8.
so, the product is (-3)*(-4)*(-5)*(-6)*(-7)*(-8).
the signs here: from -1-2 up to -1-7, that's 6 terms, each of which is negative, so the product will be (-1)^6 *3*4*5*6*7*8 = 720 * 56 (since 8! /2! = 40320 /2= 20160, no, wait 8*7*6*5*4*3= 720*56, right? 8!/2! = 40320 /2=20160. and 720*56=40320, which is 8!/2!. hmm, 8*7*6*5*4*3=720*56. yes, since 3*4*5*6*7*8=720*56/2? wait, maybe better to compute:
-3*-4=12, *-5= -60, *-6=360, *-7= -2520, *-8=20160.
so product is 20160.
but the term also includes ( -a + b ).
so, q(-1) = 20160*(-a + b).
but earlier, we found q(-1) =1.
therefore, 20160*(-a + b) =1.
so, equation (2): 20160*(-a + b) =1.
now, we have two equations:
1) 720(a + b) = -1
2) 20160*(-a + b) =1
let me write them as:
equation 1: 720a + 720b = -1
equation 2: -20160a + 20160b =1
let me solve these equations.
first, simplify equation 1 by dividing both sides by 720:
a + b = -1/720
similarly, equation 2: divide both sides by 20160:
(-a + b) =1/20160
so, now we have two equations:
1) a + b = -1/720
2) -a + b =1/20160
let me add these two equations to eliminate a:
(1) + (2): (a + b) + (-a + b) = -1/720 +1/20160
simplify left side: 2b = (-1/720) + (1/20160)
find a common denominator.
720= 720, 20160=720*28.
so, common denominator is 20160.
convert -1/720: (-1)*(28/20160) = -28/20160
so, 2b = (-28 +1)/20160 = (-27)/20160
therefore, b= (-27)/(2*20160) = (-27)/40320.
simplify that: 27 divides by 27, 40320 ÷27= 1493.333... wait, 40320 ÷ 27: 40320 ÷ 9=4480, 4480 ÷3=1493.333... hmm, maybe better to reduce fraction:
-27/40320. divide numerator and denominator by 3: -9/13440.
again divide by 3: -3/4480. hmm, 4480= 32*140= 32*7*20= 32*7*4*5. not sure. let me check: 40320 ÷27: 40320 divided by 27 is equal to 1493.333..., but since 27 and 40320 have gcd of 3? wait, 40320 ÷3=13440, which is still even. 40320=2^6 * 3^2 * 5 *7. similarly, 27=3^3. so gcd(40320,27)=32=9. so, -27/40320 ÷ by 9= -3/4480. so, yes, b= -3/4480.
then, from equation 1: a + b = -1/720, so a = -1/720 - b = -1/720 +3/4480.
compute a: let's find common denominator for 720 and 4480.
720=720, 4480=4480. let's see. 4480 ÷720=6.222..., so not a multiple. let's find lcm(720,4480).
factorize both:
720= 2^4 *3^2 *5
4480=448*10=64*7*10=64*7*10=2^6 *5*7
so lcm is 2^6 *3^2 *5*7= 64 *9 *5*7=64*315=20160.
so common denominator is 20160.
convert -1/720: 20160 ÷720=28, so -1/720= -28/20160
convert 3/4480: 20160 ÷4480=4.5. wait, 4480*4.5=20160. so 3/4480*4.5= 13.5/20160?
wait, perhaps better:
3/4480 = x/20160
then x=3*20160/4480=3*(20160/4480)=3*(4.5)=13.5.
so, 3/4480=13.5/20160.
so, a= -28/20160 +13.5/20160= (-28 +13.5)/20160= -14.5/20160.
let me convert 14.5 to 29/2: -29/2 /20160= -29/(40320).
therefore, a= -29/40320.
so, a= -29/40320 and b= -3/4480.
wait, let me check the calculations again.
compute a: a= -1/720 +3/4480.
convert to common denominator.
let me compute 1/720 = 1/(720), 3/4480=3/(4480).
lcm of 720 and 4480 is 40320 as above.
so, 1/720=56/40320 (since 40320/720=56).
similarly, 3/4480: 40320/4480=9.
so, 3/4480=3*9/40320=27/40320.
therefore, a= -56/40320 +27/40320= (-56 +27)/40320= -29/40320.
similarly, b from equation 1: a + b= -1/720.
so, b= -1/720 -a= -1/720 +29/40320.
convert again: 1/720=56/40320, so 56/40320 -29/40320= (56 -29)/40320=27/40320.
wait, but sign is wrong.
wait: b= -1/720 -a => no, wait:
wait, a + b = -1/720.
therefore, b= -1/720 -a.
so, substituting a= -29/40320:
b= -56/40320 - (-29/40320)= -56/40320 +29/40320= -27/40320.
which is the same as -3/4480:
since 40320 ÷4480=9, so -27/40320= -3/4480.
correct.
so, a= -29/40320 and b= -27/40320.
alternatively, factoring out 1/40320:
a= -29/40320, b= -27/40320.
so, a and b are fractions with denominator 40320.
now, we have q(x)= (x-2)(x-3)...(x-7)(ax +b).
so, q(x)= (x-2)(x-3)(x-4)(x-5)(x-6)(x-7)* ( (-29/40320)x -27/40320 ).
factor out -1/40320: q(x)= (x-2)(x-3)...(x-7)* (-1/40320)*(29x +27).
hmm, interesting.
but perhaps we don't need to write it like that.
now, the ultimate goal is to compute p(8).
let's recall that q(8)= p(8)*(82 -1) -8= p(8)*63 -8.
so, if we can compute q(8), then solve for p(8).
so, compute q(8)= (8-2)(8-3)(8-4)(8-5)(8-6)(8-7)*(a*8 +b).
so, compute (6)(5)(4)(3)(2)(1)* ( (-29/40320)*8 -27/40320 ).
compute the product first: 6*5=30, 30*4=120, 120*3=360, 360*2=720, 720*1=720.
so, 720*( (-29*8 -27)/40320 ).
compute numerator: -29*8= -232, so -232 -27= -259.
thus, q(8)=720*( -259/40320 ).
simplify: 720/40320 =1/56.
so, 1/56 * (-259)= -259/56.
simplify: 259 ÷7=37, 56 ÷7=8.
so, -259/56= -37/8.
therefore, q(8)= -37/8.
but q(8)=63p(8) -8.
therefore: 63p(8) -8 = -37/8.
solve for p(8): 63p(8)= -37/8 +8= (-37 +64)/8=27/8.
so, p(8)= (27/8)/63= (27/8)*(1/63)= (27/504)= (27 ÷9)/(504 ÷9)=3/56.
therefore, p(8)=3/56.
wait, let me check the calculation steps again.
so, after finding q(8)= -37/8, then:
q(8)=63p(8) -8.
hence, 63p(8)= q(8) +8= (-37/8)+8= (-37 +64)/8=27/8.
therefore, p(8)= (27/8)/63= multiply by 1/63: 27/(8*63).
but 27/63=3/7.
so, 3/(8*7)=3/56.
yes, correct.
therefore, p(8)=3/56.
wait, but let me check once again.
q(x)= (x-2)(x-3)...(x-7)(ax +b).
then, at x=8, the product (8-2)...(8-7)=6*5*4*3*2*1=720.
then times (a*8 +b).
computed a*8 +b= (-29/40320)*8 -27/40320= (-232 -27)/40320= -259/40320.
multiply by 720: 720*(-259/40320)= (-259*720)/40320.
simplify: 720/40320=1/56, so it's -259/56= -37/8.
correct.
then, q(8)= -37/8.
then, q(8)=63p(8)-8.
so, 63p(8)= q(8)+8= -37/8 +8= (-37 +64)/8=27/8.
therefore, p(8)=27/(8*63)=27/(504)=3/56.
yes.
therefore, p(8)=3/56.
so, the final answer is \boxed{\dfrac{3}{56}}.
**final answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{3}{56}}
</think>

answer: given a polynomial \( p(x) \) of degree 5 such that \( p(n) = \frac{n}{n^2 - 1} \) for \( n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \), we need to find \( p(8) \).

first, we define a polynomial \( q(x) = p(x)(x^2 - 1) - x \). this polynomial \( q(x) \) is of degree 7 and has roots at \( x = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \). therefore, we can write \( q(x) \) as:
\[
q(x) = (x-2)(x-3)(x-4)(x-5)(x-6)(x-7)(ax + b)
\]
for some constants \( a \) and \( b \).

using the definition of \( q(x) \), we know:
\[
q(1) = p(1)(0) - 1 = -1 \quad \text{and} \quad q(-1) = p(-1)(0) + 1 = 1
\]

calculating the product of the roots for \( q(1) \) and \( q(-1) \):
\[
q(1) = (1-2)(1-3)(1-4)(1-5)(1-6)(1-7)(a \cdot 1 + b) = 720(a + b) = -1
\]
\[
q(-1) = (-1-2)(-1-3)(-1-4)(-1-5)(-1-6)(-1-7)(a \cdot (-1) + b) = 20160(-a + b) = 1
\]

solving the system of equations:
\[
720(a + b) = -1
\]
\[
20160(-a + b) = 1
\]

we simplify these equations:
1. \( a + b = -\frac{1}{720} \)
2. \( -a + b = \frac{1}{20160} \)

solving these equations, we find:
\[
a = -\frac{29}{40320} \quad \text{and} \quad b = -\frac{27}{40320}
\]

next, we compute \( q(8) \):
\[
q(8) = (8-2)(8-3)(8-4)(8-5)(8-6)(8-7)(8a + b)
\]
\[
= 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 \left(8 \left(-\frac{29}{40320}\right) - \frac{27}{40320}\right)
\]
\[
= 720 \left(\frac{-232 - 27}{40320}\right) = 720 \left(\frac{-259}{40320}\right) = -\frac{37}{8}
\]

using \( q(8) = 63p(8) - 8 \):
\[
63p(8) - 8 = -\frac{37}{8}
\]
\[
63p(8) = \frac{27}{8}
\]
\[
p(8) = \frac{27}{8 \cdot 63} = \frac{3}{56}
\]

the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\dfrac{3}{56}}
\]
