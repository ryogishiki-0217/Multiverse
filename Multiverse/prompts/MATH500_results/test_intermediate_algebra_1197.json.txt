<Think>
Okay, so I have this problem here: There's a polynomial p(x) of degree 5, and it's given that p(n) = n/(n2 - 1) for n = 2, 3, 4, up to 7. I need to find p(8).
Hmm, alright, let's see.
First off, p(x) is a polynomial of degree 5.
That's important because if we know the values of a degree 5 polynomial at 6 points, then we can uniquely determine it, right?
Because a degree 5 polynomial has 6 coefficients, and if we have 6 equations, we can solve for them.
But here, the polynomial is already defined by its values at n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, which are six points.
But wait, the question is asking for p(8), which is another point.
So maybe there's a way to set this up using interpolation or maybe using some properties of polynomials?
Let me think.
The given is that p(n) = n/(n2 -1) for n=2 to 7.
But n2 -1 factors as (n-1)(n+1).
So for each of those n values, p(n) is n/( (n-1)(n+1) ).
But how does that help me find p(8)?
If I were to directly compute p(8), since p(x) is a polynomial, when x=8, it should be equal to 8/(82 -1) = 8/63.
But wait, wait, but that might not be the case because the polynomial p(x) is only specified to take those values at n=2 to 7.
For other x values, p(x) could be different.
In other words, even though p(x) agrees with x/(x2 -1) at those six points, since it's a polynomial of degree 5, it might differ elsewhere.
So we can't just assume that p(8) is 8/(82 -1).
So I need to actually find p(x) first, then plug in x=8.
But calculating a degree 5 polynomial passing through six points might be tedious.
Is there a smarter way here?
Alternatively, maybe define an auxiliary polynomial.
Let me consider the error between p(x) and f(x) = x/(x2 -1).
Let’s denote f(x) = x/(x2 -1).
Then, the polynomial p(x) agrees with f(x) at x=2,3,4,5,6,7.
So, if I can analyze the difference between p(x) and f(x), maybe that can lead to finding p(x).
But the problem is f(x) is a rational function, not a polynomial.
Hmm, that might complicate things.
Alternatively, perhaps multiply both sides by (x2 -1).
Let me try that.
If I let q(x) = (x2 -1)p(x).
Then q(x) is a polynomial of degree 5 + 2 = 7.
But for x in {2,3,4,5,6,7}, q(x) = x.
So, q(x) is equal to x at those six points.
But since q(x) is a degree 7 polynomial, we can write q(x) - x is a polynomial of degree 7 that has roots at x=2,3,4,5,6,7.
So, q(x) - x = (x-2)(x-3)(x-4)(x-5)(x-6)(x-7)R(x), where R(x) is another polynomial.
But since q(x) - x is of degree 7, and the product on the right-hand side is already degree 6, that means R(x) must be a linear polynomial, right?
Because degree 6 times degree 1 gives degree 7.
So R(x) must be a linear polynomial: R(x) = ax + b.
Therefore, q(x) - x = (x-2)(x-3)(x-4)(x-5)(x-6)(x-7)(ax + b).
Hence, q(x) = x + (x-2)(x-3)(x-4)(x-5)(x-6)(x-7)(ax + b).
But since q(x) = (x2 -1)p(x), which is a polynomial of degree 7, and we can also express q(x) as above.
Now, our goal is to find p(8), which is equal to q(8)/(82 -1).
So once we find q(8), we can divide by 63 to get p(8).
But first, we need to determine the coefficients a and b in the expression for q(x).
To find a and b, we can use the fact that q(x) must be a polynomial, but actually, since q(x) is defined as (x2 -1)p(x), which is a polynomial, we can use some other values of x where q(x) would be defined.
Wait, but the original problem doesn't give us any other values.
Hmm.
Alternatively, maybe consider asymptotic behavior or something else.
Wait, but perhaps we can use the fact that for x = 2 to 7, q(x) = x, but since q(x) is degree 7, and (x2 -1)p(x) = q(x) = x + (x-2)(x-3)...(x-7)(ax + b).
So, if we can find a and b by using some x values outside of 2 to 7 where q(x) must also equal (x2 -1)p(x).
But since p(x) is only defined through those points, maybe we need to use the fact that p(x) is a polynomial of degree 5.
Wait, but (x2 -1)p(x) is a degree 7 polynomial, so q(x) is degree 7.
Therefore, q(x) - x must be equal to (x-2)(x-3)...(x-7)(ax + b).
Therefore, q(x) = x + (x-2)(x-3)...(x-7)(ax + b).
Then, since q(x) is supposed to be equal to (x2 -1)p(x) for all x, even where p(x) is not defined (i.e., x=1 and x=-1 where x2 -1 is zero).
Wait, but perhaps at x=1 and x=-1, we can get some equations for a and b.
Let's check that.
Let me consider x=1.
At x=1, q(1) = (12 -1)p(1) = 0*p(1) = 0.
But on the other hand, according to our expression for q(x): q(1) = 1 + (1-2)(1-3)...(1-7)(a*1 + b).
Let's compute that.
(1-2)(1-3)(1-4)...(1-7) is (-1)(-2)(-3)(-4)(-5)(-6).
Let's see: start with -1, then -2, -3, -4, -5, -6.
Multiplying these together: first, the product of six negative ones would be (-1)^6 = 1, times 1*2*3*4*5*6 = 720.
So the product is 720.
Therefore, q(1) = 1 + 720*(a + b).
But we also said q(1) = 0.
Therefore, 0 = 1 + 720*(a + b), which implies 720(a + b) = -1, so a + b = -1/720.
That's equation (1).
Similarly, let's do x=-1.
q(-1) = ((-1)^2 -1)p(-1) = (1 -1)p(-1) = 0*p(-1) = 0.
Similarly, using the expression for q(x): q(-1) = -1 + (-1-2)(-1-3)...(-1-7)(a*(-1) + b).
Let's compute the product: (-1-2) = -3, (-1-3)=-4, ..., (-1-7)=-8.
So that product is (-3)(-4)(-5)(-6)(-7)(-8).
Again, six terms.
The negatives here: from -3 to -8 is six terms.
So (-1)^6 * 3*4*5*6*7*8 = 1 * 3*4*5*6*7*8 = 1* 3*4 =12, 12*5=60, 60*6=360, 360*7=2520, 2520*8=20160.
Wait, but that's six terms from -3 to -8, which is a product of six negative numbers, so (-1)^6 * 3*4*5*6*7*8?
Wait, no, six numbers: -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8. That's six numbers. Each is negative, so (-1)^6 = 1, and then multiply 3*4*5*6*7*8.
Let's compute that: 3*4=12, 12*5=60, 60*6=360, 360*7=2520, 2520*8=20160.
So the product is 20160.
Therefore, q(-1) = -1 + 20160*(-a + b).
But q(-1) is also 0.
Therefore, 0 = -1 + 20160*(-a + b).
So 20160*(-a + b) = 1, which gives -a + b = 1/20160.
That's equation (2).
Now, we have two equations:
1) a + b = -1/720
2) -a + b = 1/20160
So, we can solve for a and b.
Let me write them down:
Equation (1): a + b = -1/720
Equation (2): -a + b = 1/20160
Let me add the two equations to eliminate a:
(1) + (2):
(a + b) + (-a + b) = -1/720 + 1/20160
Simplify left side: 2b = (-1/720 + 1/20160)
Find a common denominator for the right side.
20160 is 28 * 5 * 3^2.
720 is 8 * 9 * 10 = 2^4 * 3^2 *5.
So LCM is 20160.
So convert 1/720 to x/20160.
720 * 28 = 20160, so multiply numerator and denominator by 28: -28/20160.
Similarly, 1/20160 remains as is.
So 2b = (-28 +1)/20160 = -27/20160
Therefore, divide both sides by 2:
b = -27/(2*20160) = -27/40320
Simplify that fraction.
Let's see: 27 and 40320.
Divide numerator and denominator by 3: 27 ÷3=9, 40320 ÷3=13440.
Again, 9 and 13440 GCD is 3: 9 ÷3=3, 13440 ÷3=4480.
So b = -3/4480.
Wait, wait: Wait, 27/40320: 40320 divided by 27?
Wait, perhaps let me check:
27/40320: divide numerator and denominator by 3: 9/13440, then divide again by 3: 3/4480.
So yes, b = -3/4480.
Okay.
Now, plug back into equation (1) or (2) to find a.
Let's use equation (1): a + b = -1/720.
So a = -1/720 - b = -1/720 - (-3/4480) = -1/720 + 3/4480.
Let's compute this.
First, find a common denominator for 720 and 4480.
Let's see, 720 = 2^4 *3^2 *5, 4480 = 2^7 *5 *7.
So LCM is 2^7 *3^2 *5 *7) = 13440.
So convert both fractions:
1/720 = (13440 / 720) = 18.666..., no, better to compute:
720 * 18 = 12960, which is over 13440.
So 720 * 18.666...: no, better to compute denominators.
Wait, 13440 divided by 720 is 18.666..., which is 13440 / 720 = 18.666... = 56/3.
Wait, 720 * 19 = 13680, which is over.
So 13440 /720 = 18.666..., so as fraction, 13440 = 720 * 18 + 720*0.666... = 720*18 + 720*(2/3) ?
Wait, maybe better to factor:
720 = 72 *10 = 8*9*10
13440 divided by 720: cancel 10: 1344 ÷72 = 18.666...
72 * 18 = 1296, 72*19=1332, which is still less than 1344.
1344 -1332=12, so 1344/72 =19 +12/72=19 +1/6≈19.1667.
Wait, 13440 /720= 1344 /72= 18.666..., okay, perhaps this is getting too confusing.
Let me instead compute 1/720 in terms of the common denominator 13440:
1/720 = (13440 ÷720)/13440 = 18.666... /13440.
Wait, but that's not helpful.
Let's use prime factors:
720 = 2^4 * 3^2 *5
13440 = 2^7 *3^0 ? Wait, 4480 = 2^7 *5 *7, so 4480 = 2^7 *5 *7, so 13440 = 2^7 *3 *5 *7?
Wait, 13440 divided by 4480 is 3.
So 13440 = 3 * 4480 = 3 *2^7 *5 *7.
So 13440 = 2^7 *3*5*7.
So 1/720 = 1/(2^4 *3^2 *5) = (2^3 *3 *7)/ (2^7 *3*5*7) ) = (8*3*7)/13440 = 168/13440.
Similarly, 3/4480 = 3/(2^7 *5 *7) = 3/(13440 / (3*1)) ) = wait, maybe not.
Compute 3/4480 in terms of denominator 13440:
4480 * 3 = 13440, so 3/4480 = 13440/(4480*3) reciprocal?
Wait, no:
Wait, if we have 3/4480, and we want to write it over 13440, which is 4480 * 3.
So 3/4480 = 3*3/(4480*3) = 9/13440.
Wait, 3/4480 = 9/13440.
Similarly, 1/720 = ? Let's compute 13440 ÷720 = 18.666..., so 18.666... = 56/3.
So 1/720 = 3/56 * 1/13440?
Hmm, not sure.
Let's calculate:
13440 divided by 720: 13440 ÷ 720.
Let's divide both by 10: 1344 ÷72= 18.666...
72 * 18 = 1296
72 * 18.666... = 1296 +72*(2/3) = 1296 +48 = 1344?
Wait, 72 * (18 + 2/3) = 72*18 + 72*(2/3) = 1296 + 48 = 1344.
So 13440 ÷720 = 18.666... = 18 + 2/3 = 56/3.
Therefore, 1/720 = 3/56 *1/13440?
No, wait:
Wait, 13440 ÷720 = 56/3, so 1/720 = (13440 /720)^(-1) = (56/3)^(-1) = 3/56.
So 1/720 = 3/56.
Wait, that can't be.
3/56 is approximately 0.053, and 1/720 is approximately 0.00138.
Clearly, that's not right.
Wait, maybe miscalculations here.
Wait, 13440 ÷720: let's compute 720 * 18 = 12960.
720 * 19=13320.
720 * 18.666...=13440.
So 720*(18 + 2/3) = 13440.
Therefore, 13440/720 = 18 + 2/3 = 56/3.
So 1/720 = 3/56 *1/13440?
Wait, actually, no.
Wait, 13440 = 720*(56/3).
Therefore, 1/(720) = (3/56) * (1/13440) * 13440?
Wait, perhaps this is getting too tangled.
Let me use cross multiplication.
Let's compute a = -1/720 - b = -1/720 + 3/4480.
Convert both fractions to denominator 13440.
As computed:
1/720 = 19.166.../13440?
Wait, perhaps better to compute how much 1/720 is in terms of 13440.
So 13440 ÷720 = 18.666..., so 1/720 = 1/(13440 / (18.666...)) ) = 18.666../13440 = 56/3 /13440 = 56/(3*13440) ?
Wait, no.
Alternatively, 1/720 days per second.
No, this is not helpful.
Wait, perhaps multiply 1/720 by 13440/13440:
(1/720)*(13440/13440) =13440/(720*13440) = (13440/720)/13440 = (18.666...)/13440.
But 13440/720 =56/3, so 1/720 = (56/3)*(1/13440).
So 1/720 = 56/(3*13440).
Therefore, -1/720 = -56/(3*13440).
Similarly, 3/4480 = 3/(4480).
Multiply by 3/(4480)*(3*13440/3*13440)?)?
Wait, 4480 = 13440 /3.
So 3/4480 = 3/(13440/3) = 9/13440.
So 3/4480 =9/13440.
Therefore, a = -56/(3*13440) + 9/13440.
Let me compute:
Convert -56/(3*13440) +9/13440.
Let’s write it with common denominator:
= (-56/3 +9)/13440
= (-56/3 + 27/3)/13440
= (-29/3)/13440
= -29/(3*13440)
= -29/40320
So a = -29/40320.
Therefore, we have a = -29/40320 and b = -3/4480.
Let me check that again.
From equation (1): a + b = -29/40320 -3/4480.
Convert to common denominator:
4480 = 40320 /9.
So 40320 = 9*4480.
Therefore, -3/4480 = -3*(9)/40320 = -27/40320.
Then a + b = -29/40320 -27/40320 = -56/40320 = -7/5760.
Wait, 56/40320 = 1/720, so that's correct, since equation (1) says a + b = -1/720.
So that checks out.
Similarly, equation (2): -a + b = 29/40320 -3/4480 = 29/40320 - 27/40320 = 2/40320 = 1/20160, which matches equation (2).
So the values are correct.
So, a = -29/40320 and b = -3/4480.
Let me convert b to the same denominator:
b = -3/4480 = -3*(9)/40320 = -27/40320.
Alright, so now we have a and b.
So the polynomial q(x) is given by:
q(x) = x + (x-2)(x-3)(x-4)(x-5)(x-6)(x-7)( a x + b )
So, to compute p(8), we need q(8) = (82 -1)p(8) = 63 p(8).
Therefore, p(8) = q(8)/63.
So let's compute q(8):
q(8) = 8 + (8-2)(8-3)(8-4)(8-5)(8-6)(8-7)( a*8 + b )
First, compute the product (8-2)(8-3)(8-4)(8-5)(8-6)(8-7):
That's (6)(5)(4)(3)(2)(1) = 6! = 720.
Then compute (a*8 + b): a = -29/40320, b= -3/4480 = -27/40320.
So, a*8 + b = 8*(-29/40320) + (-27/40320) = (-232 -27)/40320 = -259/40320.
Therefore, q(8) = 8 + 720*(-259/40320).
Simplify 720*( -259 ) /40320:
720 divides into 40320: 40320 /720 = 56.
So, 720*( -259 ) /40320 = ( -259 ) /56 = -259/56.
Simplify that: 259 divided by 56: 56*4=224, 259-224=35; 35/56=5/8.
So, -259/56 = -4 35/56 = -4 5/8.
Wait, but let's just keep it as -259/56.
Therefore, q(8) =8 -259/56.
Convert 8 to 448/56: 8 = 448/56.
So, 448/56 -259/56 = (448 -259)/56 = 189/56.
Simplify 189/56:
Divide numerator and denominator by 7: 189 ÷7=27, 56 ÷7=8.
So 27/8.
Therefore, q(8)=27/8.
But q(8) = (82 -1)p(8) = 63 p(8).
Therefore, p(8) = q(8)/63 = (27/8)/63 = (27/8)*(1/63) = 27/(504) = simplify by dividing numerator and denominator by 9: 3/56.
Therefore, p(8) = 3/56.
Wait, that seems straightforward.
Let me check through again.
First, we expressed q(x) = (x2 -1)p(x) =x + (x-2)(x-3)...(x-7)(a x + b).
Then, to find a and b, we used q(1)=0 and q(-1)=0, which gave two equations leading to a = -29/40320 and b= -3/4480.
Then, plugging into q(8):
The product (8-2)(8-3)...(8-7)=6*5*4*3*2*1=720.
Then, a*8 + b= (-29/40320)*8 + (-3/4480)= (-232 - 27)/40320= -259/40320.
Then, 720*(-259/40320)= -259/56.
Then, q(8)=8 -259/56= (448 -259)/56= 189/56=27/8.
Therefore, q(8)=27/8.
Then p(8)= q(8)/63= (27/8)/63=27/(504)=3/56.
Seems correct.
Let me verify once more.
Yes, 63 is 7*9, and 27/8 divided by 63 is 27/(8*63)=27/(504)=3/56.
Yes, since 504 divided by 27 is 18.666, but 504 divided by 27 is actually 18.666, but 27*18=486, 27*19=513, so no, 27/504= 3/72=1/24.
Wait, no: Wait, 27 ÷ 504 = simplify by dividing by 3: 9/168, then by 3 again: 3/56.
So 27/504=3/56.
Yes.
Therefore, p(8)=3/56.
So, the answer should be 3/56.
**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{3}{56}}
</Think>

Answer: Given a polynomial \( p(x) \) of degree 5 such that \( p(n) = \frac{n}{n^2 - 1} \) for \( n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \), we need to find \( p(8) \).

First, we define \( q(x) = (x^2 - 1)p(x) \), which is a polynomial of degree 7. We know that \( q(x) \) agrees with \( x \) at \( x = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \). Therefore, we can write:
\[
q(x) = x + (x-2)(x-3)(x-4)(x-5)(x-6)(x-7)(ax + b)
\]

Using the conditions \( q(1) = 0 \) and \( q(-1) = 0 \), we set up the following equations:
1. For \( x = 1 \):
\[
0 = 1 + 720(a + b) \implies 720(a + b) = -1 \implies a + b = -\frac{1}{720}
\]
2. For \( x = -1 \):
\[
0 = -1 + 20160(-a + b) \implies 20160(-a + b) = 1 \implies -a + b = \frac{1}{20160}
\]

Solving these equations:
- Adding the two equations:
  \[
  2b = -\frac{1}{720} + \frac{1}{20160} \implies 2b = -\frac{28}{20160} + \frac{1}{20160} \implies 2b = -\frac{27}{20160} \implies b = -\frac{27}{40320} = -\frac{3}{4480}
  \]
- Substituting \( b \) back into the first equation:
  \[
  a - \frac{3}{4480} = -\frac{1}{720} \implies a = -\frac{1}{720} + \frac{3}{4480} = -\frac{56}{40320} + \frac{27}{40320} = -\frac{29}{40320}
  \]

Now, we compute \( q(8) \):
\[
q(8) = 8 + (8-2)(8-3)(8-4)(8-5)(8-6)(8-7)\left(a \cdot 8 + b\right)
\]
\[
= 8 + 720 \left(-\frac{29}{40320} \cdot 8 - \frac{3}{4480}\right)
\]
\[
= 8 + 720 \left(-\frac{232}{40320} - \frac{3}{4480}\right)
\]
\[
= 8 + 720 \left(-\frac{259}{40320}\right)
\]
\[
= 8 - \frac{259 \cdot 720}{40320}
\]
\[
= 8 - \frac{259}{56}
\]
\[
= \frac{448}{56} - \frac{259}{56}
\]
\[
= \frac{189}{56} = \frac{27}{8}
\]

Finally, since \( q(8) = (8^2 - 1)p(8) = 63p(8) \):
\[
63p(8) = \frac{27}{8} \implies p(8) = \frac{27}{8 \cdot 63} = \frac{27}{504} = \frac{3}{56}
\]

The final answer is \(\boxed{\dfrac{3}{56}}\).

<think>
okay, so i have this problem here: there's a polynomial p(x) of degree 5, and it's given that p(n) = n/(n2 - 1) for n = 2, 3, 4, up to 7. i need to find p(8).
hmm, alright, let's see.
first off, p(x) is a polynomial of degree 5.
that's important because if we know the values of a degree 5 polynomial at 6 points, then we can uniquely determine it, right?
because a degree 5 polynomial has 6 coefficients, and if we have 6 equations, we can solve for them.
but here, the polynomial is already defined by its values at n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, which are six points.
but wait, the question is asking for p(8), which is another point.
so maybe there's a way to set this up using interpolation or maybe using some properties of polynomials?
let me think.
the given is that p(n) = n/(n2 -1) for n=2 to 7.
but n2 -1 factors as (n-1)(n+1).
so for each of those n values, p(n) is n/( (n-1)(n+1) ).
but how does that help me find p(8)?
if i were to directly compute p(8), since p(x) is a polynomial, when x=8, it should be equal to 8/(82 -1) = 8/63.
but wait, wait, but that might not be the case because the polynomial p(x) is only specified to take those values at n=2 to 7.
for other x values, p(x) could be different.
in other words, even though p(x) agrees with x/(x2 -1) at those six points, since it's a polynomial of degree 5, it might differ elsewhere.
so we can't just assume that p(8) is 8/(82 -1).
so i need to actually find p(x) first, then plug in x=8.
but calculating a degree 5 polynomial passing through six points might be tedious.
is there a smarter way here?
alternatively, maybe define an auxiliary polynomial.
let me consider the error between p(x) and f(x) = x/(x2 -1).
let’s denote f(x) = x/(x2 -1).
then, the polynomial p(x) agrees with f(x) at x=2,3,4,5,6,7.
so, if i can analyze the difference between p(x) and f(x), maybe that can lead to finding p(x).
but the problem is f(x) is a rational function, not a polynomial.
hmm, that might complicate things.
alternatively, perhaps multiply both sides by (x2 -1).
let me try that.
if i let q(x) = (x2 -1)p(x).
then q(x) is a polynomial of degree 5 + 2 = 7.
but for x in {2,3,4,5,6,7}, q(x) = x.
so, q(x) is equal to x at those six points.
but since q(x) is a degree 7 polynomial, we can write q(x) - x is a polynomial of degree 7 that has roots at x=2,3,4,5,6,7.
so, q(x) - x = (x-2)(x-3)(x-4)(x-5)(x-6)(x-7)r(x), where r(x) is another polynomial.
but since q(x) - x is of degree 7, and the product on the right-hand side is already degree 6, that means r(x) must be a linear polynomial, right?
because degree 6 times degree 1 gives degree 7.
so r(x) must be a linear polynomial: r(x) = ax + b.
therefore, q(x) - x = (x-2)(x-3)(x-4)(x-5)(x-6)(x-7)(ax + b).
hence, q(x) = x + (x-2)(x-3)(x-4)(x-5)(x-6)(x-7)(ax + b).
but since q(x) = (x2 -1)p(x), which is a polynomial of degree 7, and we can also express q(x) as above.
now, our goal is to find p(8), which is equal to q(8)/(82 -1).
so once we find q(8), we can divide by 63 to get p(8).
but first, we need to determine the coefficients a and b in the expression for q(x).
to find a and b, we can use the fact that q(x) must be a polynomial, but actually, since q(x) is defined as (x2 -1)p(x), which is a polynomial, we can use some other values of x where q(x) would be defined.
wait, but the original problem doesn't give us any other values.
hmm.
alternatively, maybe consider asymptotic behavior or something else.
wait, but perhaps we can use the fact that for x = 2 to 7, q(x) = x, but since q(x) is degree 7, and (x2 -1)p(x) = q(x) = x + (x-2)(x-3)...(x-7)(ax + b).
so, if we can find a and b by using some x values outside of 2 to 7 where q(x) must also equal (x2 -1)p(x).
but since p(x) is only defined through those points, maybe we need to use the fact that p(x) is a polynomial of degree 5.
wait, but (x2 -1)p(x) is a degree 7 polynomial, so q(x) is degree 7.
therefore, q(x) - x must be equal to (x-2)(x-3)...(x-7)(ax + b).
therefore, q(x) = x + (x-2)(x-3)...(x-7)(ax + b).
then, since q(x) is supposed to be equal to (x2 -1)p(x) for all x, even where p(x) is not defined (i.e., x=1 and x=-1 where x2 -1 is zero).
wait, but perhaps at x=1 and x=-1, we can get some equations for a and b.
let's check that.
let me consider x=1.
at x=1, q(1) = (12 -1)p(1) = 0*p(1) = 0.
but on the other hand, according to our expression for q(x): q(1) = 1 + (1-2)(1-3)...(1-7)(a*1 + b).
let's compute that.
(1-2)(1-3)(1-4)...(1-7) is (-1)(-2)(-3)(-4)(-5)(-6).
let's see: start with -1, then -2, -3, -4, -5, -6.
multiplying these together: first, the product of six negative ones would be (-1)^6 = 1, times 1*2*3*4*5*6 = 720.
so the product is 720.
therefore, q(1) = 1 + 720*(a + b).
but we also said q(1) = 0.
therefore, 0 = 1 + 720*(a + b), which implies 720(a + b) = -1, so a + b = -1/720.
that's equation (1).
similarly, let's do x=-1.
q(-1) = ((-1)^2 -1)p(-1) = (1 -1)p(-1) = 0*p(-1) = 0.
similarly, using the expression for q(x): q(-1) = -1 + (-1-2)(-1-3)...(-1-7)(a*(-1) + b).
let's compute the product: (-1-2) = -3, (-1-3)=-4, ..., (-1-7)=-8.
so that product is (-3)(-4)(-5)(-6)(-7)(-8).
again, six terms.
the negatives here: from -3 to -8 is six terms.
so (-1)^6 * 3*4*5*6*7*8 = 1 * 3*4*5*6*7*8 = 1* 3*4 =12, 12*5=60, 60*6=360, 360*7=2520, 2520*8=20160.
wait, but that's six terms from -3 to -8, which is a product of six negative numbers, so (-1)^6 * 3*4*5*6*7*8?
wait, no, six numbers: -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8. that's six numbers. each is negative, so (-1)^6 = 1, and then multiply 3*4*5*6*7*8.
let's compute that: 3*4=12, 12*5=60, 60*6=360, 360*7=2520, 2520*8=20160.
so the product is 20160.
therefore, q(-1) = -1 + 20160*(-a + b).
but q(-1) is also 0.
therefore, 0 = -1 + 20160*(-a + b).
so 20160*(-a + b) = 1, which gives -a + b = 1/20160.
that's equation (2).
now, we have two equations:
1) a + b = -1/720
2) -a + b = 1/20160
so, we can solve for a and b.
let me write them down:
equation (1): a + b = -1/720
equation (2): -a + b = 1/20160
let me add the two equations to eliminate a:
(1) + (2):
(a + b) + (-a + b) = -1/720 + 1/20160
simplify left side: 2b = (-1/720 + 1/20160)
find a common denominator for the right side.
20160 is 28 * 5 * 3^2.
720 is 8 * 9 * 10 = 2^4 * 3^2 *5.
so lcm is 20160.
so convert 1/720 to x/20160.
720 * 28 = 20160, so multiply numerator and denominator by 28: -28/20160.
similarly, 1/20160 remains as is.
so 2b = (-28 +1)/20160 = -27/20160
therefore, divide both sides by 2:
b = -27/(2*20160) = -27/40320
simplify that fraction.
let's see: 27 and 40320.
divide numerator and denominator by 3: 27 ÷3=9, 40320 ÷3=13440.
again, 9 and 13440 gcd is 3: 9 ÷3=3, 13440 ÷3=4480.
so b = -3/4480.
wait, wait: wait, 27/40320: 40320 divided by 27?
wait, perhaps let me check:
27/40320: divide numerator and denominator by 3: 9/13440, then divide again by 3: 3/4480.
so yes, b = -3/4480.
okay.
now, plug back into equation (1) or (2) to find a.
let's use equation (1): a + b = -1/720.
so a = -1/720 - b = -1/720 - (-3/4480) = -1/720 + 3/4480.
let's compute this.
first, find a common denominator for 720 and 4480.
let's see, 720 = 2^4 *3^2 *5, 4480 = 2^7 *5 *7.
so lcm is 2^7 *3^2 *5 *7) = 13440.
so convert both fractions:
1/720 = (13440 / 720) = 18.666..., no, better to compute:
720 * 18 = 12960, which is over 13440.
so 720 * 18.666...: no, better to compute denominators.
wait, 13440 divided by 720 is 18.666..., which is 13440 / 720 = 18.666... = 56/3.
wait, 720 * 19 = 13680, which is over.
so 13440 /720 = 18.666..., so as fraction, 13440 = 720 * 18 + 720*0.666... = 720*18 + 720*(2/3) ?
wait, maybe better to factor:
720 = 72 *10 = 8*9*10
13440 divided by 720: cancel 10: 1344 ÷72 = 18.666...
72 * 18 = 1296, 72*19=1332, which is still less than 1344.
1344 -1332=12, so 1344/72 =19 +12/72=19 +1/6≈19.1667.
wait, 13440 /720= 1344 /72= 18.666..., okay, perhaps this is getting too confusing.
let me instead compute 1/720 in terms of the common denominator 13440:
1/720 = (13440 ÷720)/13440 = 18.666... /13440.
wait, but that's not helpful.
let's use prime factors:
720 = 2^4 * 3^2 *5
13440 = 2^7 *3^0 ? wait, 4480 = 2^7 *5 *7, so 4480 = 2^7 *5 *7, so 13440 = 2^7 *3 *5 *7?
wait, 13440 divided by 4480 is 3.
so 13440 = 3 * 4480 = 3 *2^7 *5 *7.
so 13440 = 2^7 *3*5*7.
so 1/720 = 1/(2^4 *3^2 *5) = (2^3 *3 *7)/ (2^7 *3*5*7) ) = (8*3*7)/13440 = 168/13440.
similarly, 3/4480 = 3/(2^7 *5 *7) = 3/(13440 / (3*1)) ) = wait, maybe not.
compute 3/4480 in terms of denominator 13440:
4480 * 3 = 13440, so 3/4480 = 13440/(4480*3) reciprocal?
wait, no:
wait, if we have 3/4480, and we want to write it over 13440, which is 4480 * 3.
so 3/4480 = 3*3/(4480*3) = 9/13440.
wait, 3/4480 = 9/13440.
similarly, 1/720 = ? let's compute 13440 ÷720 = 18.666..., so 18.666... = 56/3.
so 1/720 = 3/56 * 1/13440?
hmm, not sure.
let's calculate:
13440 divided by 720: 13440 ÷ 720.
let's divide both by 10: 1344 ÷72= 18.666...
72 * 18 = 1296
72 * 18.666... = 1296 +72*(2/3) = 1296 +48 = 1344?
wait, 72 * (18 + 2/3) = 72*18 + 72*(2/3) = 1296 + 48 = 1344.
so 13440 ÷720 = 18.666... = 18 + 2/3 = 56/3.
therefore, 1/720 = 3/56 *1/13440?
no, wait:
wait, 13440 ÷720 = 56/3, so 1/720 = (13440 /720)^(-1) = (56/3)^(-1) = 3/56.
so 1/720 = 3/56.
wait, that can't be.
3/56 is approximately 0.053, and 1/720 is approximately 0.00138.
clearly, that's not right.
wait, maybe miscalculations here.
wait, 13440 ÷720: let's compute 720 * 18 = 12960.
720 * 19=13320.
720 * 18.666...=13440.
so 720*(18 + 2/3) = 13440.
therefore, 13440/720 = 18 + 2/3 = 56/3.
so 1/720 = 3/56 *1/13440?
wait, actually, no.
wait, 13440 = 720*(56/3).
therefore, 1/(720) = (3/56) * (1/13440) * 13440?
wait, perhaps this is getting too tangled.
let me use cross multiplication.
let's compute a = -1/720 - b = -1/720 + 3/4480.
convert both fractions to denominator 13440.
as computed:
1/720 = 19.166.../13440?
wait, perhaps better to compute how much 1/720 is in terms of 13440.
so 13440 ÷720 = 18.666..., so 1/720 = 1/(13440 / (18.666...)) ) = 18.666../13440 = 56/3 /13440 = 56/(3*13440) ?
wait, no.
alternatively, 1/720 days per second.
no, this is not helpful.
wait, perhaps multiply 1/720 by 13440/13440:
(1/720)*(13440/13440) =13440/(720*13440) = (13440/720)/13440 = (18.666...)/13440.
but 13440/720 =56/3, so 1/720 = (56/3)*(1/13440).
so 1/720 = 56/(3*13440).
therefore, -1/720 = -56/(3*13440).
similarly, 3/4480 = 3/(4480).
multiply by 3/(4480)*(3*13440/3*13440)?)?
wait, 4480 = 13440 /3.
so 3/4480 = 3/(13440/3) = 9/13440.
so 3/4480 =9/13440.
therefore, a = -56/(3*13440) + 9/13440.
let me compute:
convert -56/(3*13440) +9/13440.
let’s write it with common denominator:
= (-56/3 +9)/13440
= (-56/3 + 27/3)/13440
= (-29/3)/13440
= -29/(3*13440)
= -29/40320
so a = -29/40320.
therefore, we have a = -29/40320 and b = -3/4480.
let me check that again.
from equation (1): a + b = -29/40320 -3/4480.
convert to common denominator:
4480 = 40320 /9.
so 40320 = 9*4480.
therefore, -3/4480 = -3*(9)/40320 = -27/40320.
then a + b = -29/40320 -27/40320 = -56/40320 = -7/5760.
wait, 56/40320 = 1/720, so that's correct, since equation (1) says a + b = -1/720.
so that checks out.
similarly, equation (2): -a + b = 29/40320 -3/4480 = 29/40320 - 27/40320 = 2/40320 = 1/20160, which matches equation (2).
so the values are correct.
so, a = -29/40320 and b = -3/4480.
let me convert b to the same denominator:
b = -3/4480 = -3*(9)/40320 = -27/40320.
alright, so now we have a and b.
so the polynomial q(x) is given by:
q(x) = x + (x-2)(x-3)(x-4)(x-5)(x-6)(x-7)( a x + b )
so, to compute p(8), we need q(8) = (82 -1)p(8) = 63 p(8).
therefore, p(8) = q(8)/63.
so let's compute q(8):
q(8) = 8 + (8-2)(8-3)(8-4)(8-5)(8-6)(8-7)( a*8 + b )
first, compute the product (8-2)(8-3)(8-4)(8-5)(8-6)(8-7):
that's (6)(5)(4)(3)(2)(1) = 6! = 720.
then compute (a*8 + b): a = -29/40320, b= -3/4480 = -27/40320.
so, a*8 + b = 8*(-29/40320) + (-27/40320) = (-232 -27)/40320 = -259/40320.
therefore, q(8) = 8 + 720*(-259/40320).
simplify 720*( -259 ) /40320:
720 divides into 40320: 40320 /720 = 56.
so, 720*( -259 ) /40320 = ( -259 ) /56 = -259/56.
simplify that: 259 divided by 56: 56*4=224, 259-224=35; 35/56=5/8.
so, -259/56 = -4 35/56 = -4 5/8.
wait, but let's just keep it as -259/56.
therefore, q(8) =8 -259/56.
convert 8 to 448/56: 8 = 448/56.
so, 448/56 -259/56 = (448 -259)/56 = 189/56.
simplify 189/56:
divide numerator and denominator by 7: 189 ÷7=27, 56 ÷7=8.
so 27/8.
therefore, q(8)=27/8.
but q(8) = (82 -1)p(8) = 63 p(8).
therefore, p(8) = q(8)/63 = (27/8)/63 = (27/8)*(1/63) = 27/(504) = simplify by dividing numerator and denominator by 9: 3/56.
therefore, p(8) = 3/56.
wait, that seems straightforward.
let me check through again.
first, we expressed q(x) = (x2 -1)p(x) =x + (x-2)(x-3)...(x-7)(a x + b).
then, to find a and b, we used q(1)=0 and q(-1)=0, which gave two equations leading to a = -29/40320 and b= -3/4480.
then, plugging into q(8):
the product (8-2)(8-3)...(8-7)=6*5*4*3*2*1=720.
then, a*8 + b= (-29/40320)*8 + (-3/4480)= (-232 - 27)/40320= -259/40320.
then, 720*(-259/40320)= -259/56.
then, q(8)=8 -259/56= (448 -259)/56= 189/56=27/8.
therefore, q(8)=27/8.
then p(8)= q(8)/63= (27/8)/63=27/(504)=3/56.
seems correct.
let me verify once more.
yes, 63 is 7*9, and 27/8 divided by 63 is 27/(8*63)=27/(504)=3/56.
yes, since 504 divided by 27 is 18.666, but 504 divided by 27 is actually 18.666, but 27*18=486, 27*19=513, so no, 27/504= 3/72=1/24.
wait, no: wait, 27 ÷ 504 = simplify by dividing by 3: 9/168, then by 3 again: 3/56.
so 27/504=3/56.
yes.
therefore, p(8)=3/56.
so, the answer should be 3/56.
**final answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{3}{56}}
</think>

answer: given a polynomial \( p(x) \) of degree 5 such that \( p(n) = \frac{n}{n^2 - 1} \) for \( n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \), we need to find \( p(8) \).

first, we define \( q(x) = (x^2 - 1)p(x) \), which is a polynomial of degree 7. we know that \( q(x) \) agrees with \( x \) at \( x = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \). therefore, we can write:
\[
q(x) = x + (x-2)(x-3)(x-4)(x-5)(x-6)(x-7)(ax + b)
\]

using the conditions \( q(1) = 0 \) and \( q(-1) = 0 \), we set up the following equations:
1. for \( x = 1 \):
\[
0 = 1 + 720(a + b) \implies 720(a + b) = -1 \implies a + b = -\frac{1}{720}
\]
2. for \( x = -1 \):
\[
0 = -1 + 20160(-a + b) \implies 20160(-a + b) = 1 \implies -a + b = \frac{1}{20160}
\]

solving these equations:
- adding the two equations:
  \[
  2b = -\frac{1}{720} + \frac{1}{20160} \implies 2b = -\frac{28}{20160} + \frac{1}{20160} \implies 2b = -\frac{27}{20160} \implies b = -\frac{27}{40320} = -\frac{3}{4480}
  \]
- substituting \( b \) back into the first equation:
  \[
  a - \frac{3}{4480} = -\frac{1}{720} \implies a = -\frac{1}{720} + \frac{3}{4480} = -\frac{56}{40320} + \frac{27}{40320} = -\frac{29}{40320}
  \]

now, we compute \( q(8) \):
\[
q(8) = 8 + (8-2)(8-3)(8-4)(8-5)(8-6)(8-7)\left(a \cdot 8 + b\right)
\]
\[
= 8 + 720 \left(-\frac{29}{40320} \cdot 8 - \frac{3}{4480}\right)
\]
\[
= 8 + 720 \left(-\frac{232}{40320} - \frac{3}{4480}\right)
\]
\[
= 8 + 720 \left(-\frac{259}{40320}\right)
\]
\[
= 8 - \frac{259 \cdot 720}{40320}
\]
\[
= 8 - \frac{259}{56}
\]
\[
= \frac{448}{56} - \frac{259}{56}
\]
\[
= \frac{189}{56} = \frac{27}{8}
\]

finally, since \( q(8) = (8^2 - 1)p(8) = 63p(8) \):
\[
63p(8) = \frac{27}{8} \implies p(8) = \frac{27}{8 \cdot 63} = \frac{27}{504} = \frac{3}{56}
\]

the final answer is \(\boxed{\dfrac{3}{56}}\)
