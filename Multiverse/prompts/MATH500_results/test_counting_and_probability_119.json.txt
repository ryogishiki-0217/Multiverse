Okay, so I need to find the constant term in the expansion of (10x3 - 1/(2x2))5. Hmm, let me think. I remember that for expansions like (a + b)n, we can use the binomial theorem, which is the sum from k=0 to n of C(n, k) * a^(n-k) * b^k. Here, a is 10x3, b is -1/(2x2), and n is 5. The constant term is the one where the exponent of x is zero. So, my goal is to find the term in the expansion where the power of x cancels out, i.e., the exponent of x is 0.

1: The binomial theorem provides the general term in the expansion of (a + b)^n as C(n, k) * a^(n-k) * b^k. In this problem, 'a' is 10x^3, 'b' is -1/(2x^2), and 'n' is 5. Substituting these values into the general term formula yields C(5, k) * (10x^3)^(5-k) * (-1/(2x^2))^k. This expression simplifies to C(5, k) * (10)^(5-k) * (x^3)^(5-k) * (-1)^k * (1/2)^k * (1/(x^2))^k.

2: The general term from the binomial expansion is given by C(5, k) * (10x3)^(5 - k) * (-1/(2x2))^k. The objective is to determine the value of k for which the exponent of x in this term is zero.

<Conclusion>
The general term of the expansion is C(5, k) * (10)^(5-k) * (-1/2)^k * x^(15 - 5k), and the constant term corresponds to the specific value of k where the exponent of x is zero.

1: The exponent of x in the general term is calculated from the expression (x^3)^(5 - k) * (1/x^2)^k. This exponent is 3(5 - k) - 2k, which simplifies to 15 - 3k - 2k, resulting in 15 - 5k. Setting the exponent of x to zero gives the equation 15 - 5k = 0. Solving for k yields 15 = 5k, and thus k = 3.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The constant term is found by substituting k=3 into the general term expression. The calculation proceeds as follows: C(5, 3) * (10)^(5-3) * (-1/2)^3 * x^(15-5*3). This simplifies to C(5, 3) * (10)^2 * (-1/2)^3 * x^0. The binomial coefficient C(5, 3) is 10. The term (10)^2 evaluates to 100. The term (-1/2)^3 is -1/8. The x^0 term equals 1. The product of these components is 10 * 100 * (-1/8) * 1, which equals 1000 * (-1/8), resulting in -125.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The value k=3 satisfies the condition for the exponent of x to be zero. Substituting k=3 into the general term expression yields the constant term -125.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Wait, let me check that again. If k=3, then the term is C(5,3) * (10x3)^2 * (-1/(2x2))^3. So, let's compute each part: C(5,3) = 10.
Let's think in parallel.

1: The term (10x^3)^2 evaluates to 100x^6.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The component (-1/(2x^2))^3 is evaluated as (-1)^3 / (2^3 * (x^2)^3), which simplifies to -1 / (8x^6) or -1/(8x^6).
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The (10x^3)^2 component evaluates to 100x^6, and the (-1/(2x^2))^3 component evaluates to -1/(8x^6).
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Putting it all together: 10 * 100x6 * -1/(8x6) = 10 * 100 * -1/8 * x^(6-6) = 10 * 100 * -1/8 * x^0 = 10 * 100 * -1/8 * 1. 10 * 100 is 1000, and 1000 * -1/8 is -125. So, the constant term is -125. Wait, but just to make sure, let me verify with another approach. Sometimes when dealing with binomial expansions, especially with negative exponents, it's easy to make a mistake. Alternatively, maybe using the general term formula again. The general term is T_{k+1} = C(5, k) * (10x3)^{5 - k} * (-1/(2x2))^k. Let me write out the exponents of x in that term: In (10x3)^{5 - k}, the exponent is 3*(5 - k). In (1/(x2))^k, the exponent is -2k. So total exponent: 3*(5 - k) - 2k = 15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k. Setting this equal to zero: 15 - 5k = 0 → k = 3. So, same result. Then, compute the term for k=3. Coefficient part: C(5,3) * 10^{5 - k} * (-1/2)^k. So, C(5,3)=10. 10^(5 - 3)=10^2=100. (-1/2)^3= -1/8. So, 10 * 100 * -1/8 = -125. Same answer. So, confirms that the constant term is -125. Just to be absolutely sure, maybe expand it mentally and see. But for (10x3 - 1/(2x2))5, the terms would be: (10x3)^5, then C(5,1) (10x3)^4 * (-1/(2x2)), then ... and so on. But the constant term is where the x terms cancel out. Since each (10x3) contributes an x3 and each (-1/(2x2)) contributes an x^(-2). So, if we have 5 terms total. Suppose we have m terms of 10x3 and (5 - m) terms of -1/(2x2). Wait, no, in the expansion, each term corresponds to choosing k times the second term and (n - k) times the first term. So, exponents: (10x3)^(5 - k) * (-1/(2x2))^k, as earlier. Then, as we set before, exponent is 3*(5 - k) -2*k = 15 - 5k. So, solving 15 -5k =0 gives k=3. So, when k=3, we have (-1/(2x2))^3, which is -1/8x^6, and (10x3)^(5 - 3)= (10x3)^2=100x6. Multiply them together: 100x6 * -1/(8x6) = -100/8 = -12.5, then multiply by the binomial coefficient C(5,3)=10. So, -12.5 *10= -125. Same result again. So, definitely, the constant term is -125. Therefore, the answer should be \boxed{-125}. Wait, but let me just check one more time. Wait, in the problem statement, it's written as (10x3 - 1/(2x2))5. So, the binomial theorem alternates the signs. Since the second term is negative, the signs will alternate starting from positive for the first term. So, the expansion will be: (10x3)^5 - C(5,1) (10x3)^4 * (1/(2x2)) + C(5,2) (10x3)^3 * (1/(2x2))^2 - C(5,3) (10x3)^2 * (1/(2x2))^3 + ... So, the term with k=3 is the fourth term, which would have a negative sign because the first term is positive, second negative, third positive, third positive, fourth negative, etc. Wait, k starts at 0, so the general term is (-1)^k * C(5, k) * (10x3)^(5 - k) * (1/(2x2))^k. Therefore, the coefficient for the term with k=3 would be (-1)^3 * C(5,3) *10^(5 - k) * (1/2)^k. So, (-1)^3 is -1, so that multiplied by C(5,3)*10^2*(1/2)^3 gives -1 * 10 *100 * 1/8 = -125, same as before. So, regardless, everything checks out. So, the final answer is -125. Okay, I think that's it.
the final answer is \boxed{-125}

Answer: To find the constant term in the expansion of $$\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5$$, we use the binomial theorem. The general term in the expansion is given by:

$$
C(5, k) \cdot (10x^3)^{5 - k} \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
$$

We need the term where the exponent of \(x\) is zero. The exponent of \(x\) in the general term is:

$$
3(5 - k) - 2k = 15 - 5k
$$

Setting this equal to zero to find the constant term:

$$
15 - 5k = 0 \implies k = 3
$$

Substituting \(k = 3\) into the general term:

$$
C(5, 3) \cdot (10x^3)^{2} \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3
$$

Calculating each part:

- The binomial coefficient \(C(5, 3) = 10\)
- \((10x^3)^2 = 100x^6\)
- \(\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = -\frac{1}{8x^6}\)

Combining these:

$$
10 \cdot 100x^6 \cdot -\frac{1}{8x^6} = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} = -125
$$

Thus, the constant term is \(\boxed{-125}\).

answer: to find the constant term in the expansion of $$\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5$$, we use the binomial theorem. the general term in the expansion is given by:

$$
c(5, k) \cdot (10x^3)^{5 - k} \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
$$

we need the term where the exponent of \(x\) is zero. the exponent of \(x\) in the general term is:

$$
3(5 - k) - 2k = 15 - 5k
$$

setting this equal to zero to find the constant term:

$$
15 - 5k = 0 \implies k = 3
$$

substituting \(k = 3\) into the general term:

$$
c(5, 3) \cdot (10x^3)^{2} \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3
$$

calculating each part:

- the binomial coefficient \(c(5, 3) = 10\)
- \((10x^3)^2 = 100x^6\)
- \(\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = -\frac{1}{8x^6}\)

combining these:

$$
10 \cdot 100x^6 \cdot -\frac{1}{8x^6} = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} = -125
$$

thus, the constant term is \(\boxed{-125}\)
