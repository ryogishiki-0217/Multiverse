Okay, so I need to convert the repeating decimal 0.133113311331... (I guess the bar over 1331 means that "1331" is the repeating block) into a fraction.
Then, once I have that fraction in simplest terms, add the numerator and denominator for the answer.
First, I remember that there's a standard method for converting repeating decimals into fractions.
Let me recall... if you have a decimal like 0.abcabcabc..., where abc is the repeating part, you can let that decimal be x.
Then, multiply x by 10^n, where n is the number of digits in the repeating block.
So, for three digits, you multiply by 1000, and then subtract x to eliminate the decimal part.
Let me try applying that here.
The repeating block here is "1331", which has 4 digits.
So, maybe I need to multiply by 10^4, which is 10,000?
Wait, let me set it up step by step.
Let x = 0.133113311331...
Since the repeating block is 4 digits, multiplying x by 10,000 (which is 10^4) will shift the decimal point 4 places to the right, aligning the repeating parts after the decimal point.
So,
10000x = 1331.133113311331...
Now, if I subtract x = 0.133113311331... from this, the right-hand sides should subtract nicely:
10000x - x = 1331.133113311331... - 0.133113311331...
Which gives:
9999x = 1331
Therefore, x = 1331 / 9999
Hmm, so then the fraction would be 1331 over 9999.
But the problem states that a and b should be positive integers with a gcd of 1.
So, I need to check if 1331 and 9999 have any common factors.
If they do, I need to simplify the fraction further.
Let me see.

Wait, so 1331 divided by 11 is 121.
Let's check that: 11*111 = 1221, and 11*121 = 1331.
Yes, 11*121=1331.
So 1331 factors into 11*11*11, so 11^3.
1331=11^3.
Okay, then.
Now 9999.
Let's factor that.
We can write 9999 as 10000 - 1.
Which is 10^4 - 1.
This can be factored as (10^2)^2 - 1 = (10^2 - 1)(10^2 + 1) = (99)(101).
So 9999 = 99 * 101.
Now 99 is 9*11, and 101 is a prime number.
So 9999 = 9 * 11 * 101 = factoring 9 as 3^2, so overall, 9999 = 3^2 * 11 * 101.
Now, let's look at the numerator and denominator:
1331 = 11^3
9999 = 3^2 * 11 * 101
So, the common factors are 11.
Therefore, we can divide both numerator and denominator by 11.
Let's think in parallel.

1: The numerator 1331, which is 11^3, is divided by 11, resulting in 11^2 or 121.

<Path>
2: The denominator, 9999, is divided by 11, resulting in a simplified denominator of 909.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The simplified numerator is 121, and the simplified denominator is 909.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So, 1331 / 9999 = (11^3) / (3^2 * 11 * 101) ) = 11^2 / (3^2 * 101) = 121 / 909.
Check if 121 and 909 have any common factors.
121 is 11^2.
909: let's check its factors.
909 divided by 3?
Sum of digits: 9 + 0 + 9 = 18, which is divisible by 3.
So 909 / 3 = 303.
303 divided by 3 is 101.
So 909 = 3 * 3 * 101 = 3^2 * 101.
So 121 = 11^2 and 909 = 3^2 * 101.
No common factors.
So the fraction 121/909 is reduced to simplest terms.
Therefore, a = 121 and b = 909.
Hence, a + b = 121 + 909 = 1030.
Wait, but hold on.
Let me confirm.
Original fraction was 1331/9999.
GCD(1331,9999).
Since 1331 is 11^3 and 9999 = 3^2 * 11 * 101.
The GCD is 11.
So dividing both by 11 gives 121/909.
Then GCD(121, 909).
121 is 11^2, 909 is 3^2 * 101.
No common factors, so yes, GCD is 1.
Therefore, a = 121 and b = 909.
So a + b = 1030.
Therefore, the answer is 1030.
But let me just double-check.
Let me compute 121 + 909.
121 + 909: 121 + 900 is 1021, plus 9 is 1030.
Yes.
So, the final answer is 1030.
**Final Answer**
the final answer is \boxed{1030}
</Think>

Answer: Let \( x = 0.\overline{1331} \). This means the repeating block is "1331", which has 4 digits. To convert this repeating decimal into a fraction, we multiply \( x \) by \( 10^4 = 10000 \) to shift the decimal point four places to the right:

\[
10000x = 1331.133113311331\ldots
\]

Subtracting the original \( x \) from this equation eliminates the repeating decimal part:

\[
10000x - x = 1331.133113311331\ldots - 0.133113311331\ldots
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
9999x = 1331
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{1331}{9999}
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1331 and 9999. The prime factorization of 1331 is \( 11^3 \), and the prime factorization of 9999 is \( 3^2 \times 11 \times 101 \). The common factor is 11. Dividing the numerator and the denominator by 11:

\[
\frac{1331 \div 11}{9999 \div 11} = \frac{121}{909}
\]

The fraction \( \frac{121}{909} \) is in its simplest form since the GCD of 121 (\( 11^2 \)) and 909 (\( 3^2 \times 101 \)) is 1. Therefore, \( a = 121 \) and \( b = 909 \).

Finally, adding \( a \) and \( b \):

\[
a + b = 121 + 909 = 1030
\]

The final answer is \(\boxed{1030}\).

wait, so 1331 divided by 11 is 121.
let's check that: 11*111 = 1221, and 11*121 = 1331.
yes, 11*121=1331.
so 1331 factors into 11*11*11, so 11^3.
1331=11^3.
okay, then.
now 9999.
let's factor that.
we can write 9999 as 10000 - 1.
which is 10^4 - 1.
this can be factored as (10^2)^2 - 1 = (10^2 - 1)(10^2 + 1) = (99)(101).
so 9999 = 99 * 101.
now 99 is 9*11, and 101 is a prime number.
so 9999 = 9 * 11 * 101 = factoring 9 as 3^2, so overall, 9999 = 3^2 * 11 * 101.
now, let's look at the numerator and denominator:
1331 = 11^3
9999 = 3^2 * 11 * 101

so, 1331 / 9999 = (11^3) / (3^2 * 11 * 101) ) = 11^2 / (3^2 * 101) = 121 / 909.
check if 121 and 909 have any common factors.
121 is 11^2.
909: let's check its factors.
909 divided by 3?
sum of digits: 9 + 0 + 9 = 18, which is divisible by 3.
so 909 / 3 = 303.
303 divided by 3 is 101.
so 909 = 3 * 3 * 101 = 3^2 * 101.
so 121 = 11^2 and 909 = 3^2 * 101.
no common factors.
so the fraction 121/909 is reduced to simplest terms.
therefore, a = 121 and b = 909.
hence, a + b = 121 + 909 = 1030.
wait, but hold on.

original fraction was 1331/9999.
gcd(1331,9999).
since 1331 is 11^3 and 9999 = 3^2 * 11 * 101.
the gcd is 11.
so dividing both by 11 gives 121/909.
then gcd(121, 909).
121 is 11^2, 909 is 3^2 * 101.
no common factors, so yes, gcd is 1.
therefore, a = 121 and b = 909.
so a + b = 1030.
therefore, the answer is 1030.
but let me just double-check.
let me compute 121 + 909.
121 + 909: 121 + 900 is 1021, plus 9 is 1030.
yes.

this simplifies to:

\[
9999x = 1331

solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{1331}{9999}
\]

next, we simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 1331 and 9999. the prime factorization of 1331 is \( 11^3 \), and the prime factorization of 9999 is \( 3^2 \times 11 \times 101 \). the common factor is 11. dividing the numerator and the denominator by 11:

\[
\frac{1331 \div 11}{9999 \div 11} = \frac{121}{909}

the fraction \( \frac{121}{909} \) is in its simplest form since the gcd of 121 (\( 11^2 \)) and 909 (\( 3^2 \times 101 \)) is 1. therefore, \( a = 121 \) and \( b = 909 \).

finally, adding \( a \) and \( b \):

the final answer is \(\boxed{1030}\)
