Okay, so I need to find the greatest possible value of this expression: (a + 1/b)(1/b - a), given that -6 ≤ a ≤ -2 and 3 ≤ b ≤ 5.
Hmm, let me see.
First, maybe I can simplify or expand the expression to see if it's easier to handle.
Let me multiply it out.
Let's think in parallel.

</Path>
<Conclusion>
The expansion of the expression (a + 1/b)(1/b - a) yields the intermediate terms a/b, -a², 1/b², and -a/b.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So when I expand it:
(a + 1/b)(1/b - a) = (a)(1/b) + (a)(-a) + (1/b)(1/b) + (1/b)(-a)
Simplify like terms:
The a(1/b) and the -a(1/b) would cancel each other out, right?
Because one is positive a/b and the other is negative a/b.
So those two terms cancel.
Then we have the other two terms: -a^2 and (1/b)^2.
So the expression simplifies to -a^2 + (1/b)^2.
So, that's -(a^2) + (1/b)^2.
Hmm, okay.
So the expression simplifies to (1/b)^2 - a^2.
So, it's a difference between (1/b)^2 and a^2.
Our goal is to maximize this difference.
So, to maximize (1/b)^2 - a^2, we need to either maximize (1/b)^2 or minimize a^2, or both.
But let's think about how these terms behave.
Let's think in parallel.

<Outline>
2: Determine the range of a² for a ∈ [-6,-2].
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The term (1/b)² is a function of b, where b ranges from 3 to 5. The function 1/b is decreasing over this interval, so its minimum value is 1/5 when b=5, and its maximum value is 1/3 when b=3. Squaring these values gives the range for (1/b)² as [1/25, 1/9].
</Path>
<Path>
2: The range of a² is determined for a in the interval [-6, -2]. The square of a negative number is positive, so a² will be positive.
Let's think in parallel.

The square of a, a², equals 36 when a is -6, and 4 when a is -2.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
The minimum value of a² within the interval is 4, occurring at a = -2, and the maximum value is 36, occurring at a = -6. The term a² is to be minimized in the expression (1/b)² - a².
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The term (1/b)², with b ∈ [3,5], varies in the range [1/25, 1/9]. The term a², with a ∈ [-6,-2], varies in the range [4, 36], and its minimization is necessary for maximizing the expression (1/b)² - a².
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So, to maximize (1/b)^2 - a^2, we need to:
Maximize (1/b)^2: which happens when b is minimized, so b=3.
Minimize a^2: which happens when a is closest to zero, so a=-2.
Therefore, to get the maximum value, we should take b=3 and a=-2.
Let's check that:
(1/b)^2 - a^2 = (1/3)^2 - (-2)^2 = 1/9 - 4 = (1 - 36)/9 = -35/9 ≈ -3.888...
But wait, is that the maximum?
Wait, perhaps I need to check whether making (1/b)^2 bigger or making a^2 smaller has a greater impact.
Wait, perhaps in some cases, if a^2 is large but (1/b)^2 is the largest possible, the negative term is larger, leading to a more positive result?
Wait, no.
Wait, the expression is (1/b)^2 - a^2.
So, to maximize this, we need to make the first term as large as possible and the second term as small as possible.
The first term (1/b)^2 is largest when b is as small as possible, so b=3.
The second term, a^2, is minimized when a is closest to zero, so a=-2.
Therefore, the maximum should occur at b=3 and a=-2.
Let's compute that:
(1/3)^2 - (-2)^2 = (1/9) - 4 = (1 - 36)/9 = -35/9 ≈ -3.888...
Wait, but maybe if we take a more negative a, even though a^2 increases, if (1/b)^2 is sufficiently large?
For example, if we take b=3 (so (1/b)^2=1/9) but take a more negative, say a=-6.
Then a^2=36.
So the expression would be 1/9 - 36 = (1 - 324)/9 = -323/9 ≈ -35.888...
Which is much more negative, so indeed worse.
Alternatively, if we take b=5, which makes (1/b)^2=1/25, but then even if we take a=-2, a^2=4, then the expression is 1/25 -4 = (1 - 100)/25 = -99/25 = -3.96, which is more negative than -35/9 (≈ -3.888...).
Alternatively, maybe choosing different combinations?
For example, if we take b=3 (maximizing (1/b)^2) and a a bit more negative, say a=-3.
Then a^2=9.
So expression is 1/9 -9 = (1 -81)/9= -80/9 ≈ -8.888...
Which is worse.
Alternatively, taking b=4.
Then (1/4)^2=1/16.
If a=-2, a^2=4.
So 1/16 -4= (1 -64)/16= -63/16≈-3.9375.
Still worse than -3.888...
Alternatively, taking b=3 and a=-5.
Then a^2=25.
(1/3)^2 -25=1/9 -25= (1 -225)/9=-224/9≈-24.888...
Which is even worse.
So, indeed, the maximum seems to occur at b=3 and a=-2, giving -35/9.
Wait, but is that the maximum?
Let me confirm.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: Determine if the expression (1/b)² - a² can achieve a positive value by checking the maximum of (1/b)² and the minimum of a².
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: Evaluate the expression (1/b)² - a² at the boundary points (b=3, a=-2) and (b=5, a=-6) to determine the range of possible values.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The expression (1/b)² - a² is a difference between two non-negative terms, (1/b)² and a², both of which are non-negative. Consequently, the overall expression can be positive, negative, or zero. The maximum value of (1/b)² is 1/9, occurring when b=3, and the minimum value of a² is 4, occurring when a=-2. The question arises whether the maximum possible value of the expression is positive or if it is negative. The expression (1/b)² - a² is maximized by maximizing (1/b)² and minimizing a². The maximum value of (1/b)² is 1/9, and the minimum value of a² is 4. The difference 1/9 - 4 equals -35/9, which is approximately -3.888. This calculation confirms that the maximum value is negative. The expression (1/b)² - a² cannot be positive because the maximum value of (1/b)² is 1/9, and the minimum value of a² is 4; since 1/9 is less than 4, the difference 1/9 - 4 is negative.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The maximum value of (1/b)² is 1/9, occurring when b=3, and the minimum value of a² is 4, occurring when a=-2. The expression (1/b)² - a², evaluated at these boundary points (b=3, a=-2), results in 1/9 - 4 = -35/9. This value is negative. The expression is also evaluated at the opposite boundary points (b=5, a=-6), yielding (1/5)² - (-6)² = 1/25 - 36 = -899/25. This value is approximately -35.96, which is significantly more negative. The range of possible values for the expression is from -899/25 to -35/9.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The expression (1/b)² - a², with (1/b)² ≤ 1/9 and a² ≥ 4, cannot be positive. Evaluating the expression at the boundary points (b=3, a=-2) yields -35/9, and evaluating it at the opposite boundary points (b=5, a=-6) yields -899/25, establishing that the maximum value is -35/9 and the minimum value is -899/25.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Wait, but in that case, the maximum value is -35/9.
Wait, but is that really the maximum?
Is there any combination of a and b where the expression becomes less negative, i.e., closer to zero?
For example, if we take a between -2 and -6?
Wait, suppose a=-3.
Then a^2=9.
If we take b=3, (1/b)^2=1/9.
So 1/9 -9= -80/9≈-8.888...
If we take b=5, (1/5)^2=1/25.
1/25 -9= -224/25≈-8.96.
So both worse.
Alternatively, if a=-4, a^2=16.
b=3: 1/9 -16≈-15.777...
b=5: 1/25 -16≈-15.96...
So again, more negative.
Wait, so for all a more negative than -2, even with the smallest b (which is b=3), the expression becomes more negative.
Therefore, the maximum value is indeed achieved at a=-2 and b=3, with the value -35/9.
Wait, but let me verify with another example.
Let's check a=-2.5 (which is not allowed since a must be between -6 and -2, but in the original problem, the constraints are a is between -6 and -2, inclusive, right?
Because the original problem says "if" the problem is presented with a and b in certain ranges.
Wait, the original problem statement is not exactly clear.
Wait, the original problem is: "Solve the following math problem: If $a$ and $b$ are real numbers such that $-6 \leq a \leq -2$ and $3 \leq b \leq 5$, find the maximum value of $\frac{1}{b^2} - a^2$."
Wait, actually, when I first saw the problem, it was presented in a box, but now in the revised version, it's in the prompt.
However, in the user's original message, they wrote: "Solve the following math problem: If $-6 \leq a \leq -2$ and $3 \leq b \leq 5$, find the maximum value of $\frac{1}{b^2} - a^2$."
Therefore, a is between -6 and -2, and b is between 3 and 5.
So, the variables a and b can take any real values within those intervals, and we need to find the maximum value of the expression (1/b^2) -a^2.
Therefore, my previous analysis still holds.
The maximum value is achieved when 1/b^2 is as large as possible (i.e., b as small as possible, so b=3) and a^2 as small as possible (i.e., a as close to zero as possible, which is a=-2).
Therefore, plugging in b=3 and a=-2, we get (1/3^2) - (-2)^2 = 1/9 -4= -35/9.
But, wait, this is negative.
Is that correct?
Wait, but is that really the maximum?
Wait, perhaps the expression can take positive values?
For example, if 1/b^2 is larger than a^2.
However, given that a^2 is at least 4 (since a is at least -6, so a^2 is at least 4) and 1/b^2 is at most 1/9 (since b is at least 3, so 1/b^2 is at most 1/9).
Since 1/9 is less than 4, the expression (1/b^2 -a^2) cannot be positive.
Therefore, the maximum value is the least negative value, which is -35/9.
Wait, but in mathematics, the least negative value is the maximum when all values are negative.
For example, between -1 and -10, -1 is the maximum.
Therefore, in this case, since the expression can't be positive, the maximum value is the least negative one, which is -35/9.
Therefore, the answer is -35/9.
But let me confirm once more.
Suppose we take some values between the extremes.
Let's take b=4 (middle of the interval [3,5]), so 1/b^2=1/16≈0.0625.
Let's take a=-3, so a^2=9.
So expression is 0.0625 -9≈-8.9375.
Compare to -35/9≈-3.888...
So much worse.
If we take a=-2.5, a^2=6.25.
Then expression is 1/16 -6.25≈0.0625 -6.25≈-6.1875.
Still worse.
Alternatively, take b=3.5, so 1/b^2≈1/12.25≈0.0816.
Take a=-2.5, so a^2=6.25.
Expression≈0.0816 -6.25≈-6.1684.
Still worse.
Alternatively, take b=3. So 1/b^2=1/9≈0.1111.
Take a=-2.5, a^2=6.25.
Expression≈0.1111 -6.25≈-6.1389.
Still worse.
But if we take a=-2 (the smallest a^2) and b=3 (the smallest b), we get 1/9 -4= -35/9≈-3.888...
So this is better than all the other combinations.
Therefore, the maximum value is -35/9.
Therefore, the answer is -35/9.
But, in the original calculation, when we computed (1/3)^2 - (-2)^2=1/9 -4, which is -35/9.
So, yes.
Alternatively, to write as a fraction:
1/9 -4=1/9 -36/9= -35/9.
Therefore, confirmed.
So the maximum value is -35/9.
Hence, the final answer is -35/9.
**Final Answer**
\boxed{-\dfrac{35}{9}}
</Think>

Answer: To solve the problem of finding the maximum value of \(\frac{1}{b^2} - a^2\) given the constraints \(-6 \leq a \leq -2\) and \(3 \leq b \leq 5\), we need to analyze the expression and determine the values of \(a\) and \(b\) that maximize it.

1. **Expression Analysis**:
   - The expression is \(\frac{1}{b^2} - a^2\).
   - To maximize this, we need to maximize \(\frac{1}{b^2}\) and minimize \(a^2\).

2. **Maximizing \(\frac{1}{b^2}\)**:
   - The term \(\frac{1}{b^2}\) is maximized when \(b\) is minimized because \(b\) is in the denominator.
   - The minimum value of \(b\) within the given range \(3 \leq b \leq 5\) is \(b = 3\).
   - Therefore, \(\frac{1}{b^2}\) is maximized as \(\frac{1}{3^2} = \frac{1}{9}\).

3. **Minimizing \(a^2\)**:
   - The term \(a^2\) is minimized when \(a\) is closest to zero.
   - The value of \(a\) closest to zero within the given range \(-6 \leq a \leq -2\) is \(a = -2\).
   - Therefore, \(a^2\) is minimized as \((-2)^2 = 4\).

4. **Combining the Results**:
   - Substituting \(b = 3\) and \(a = -2\) into the expression:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3^2} - (-2)^2 = \frac{1}{9} - 4
     \]
   - Converting 4 to a fraction with a denominator of 9:
     \[
     \frac{1}{9} - \frac{36}{9} = -\frac{35}{9}
     \]

5. **Verification**:
   - Checking other combinations of \(a\) and \(b\) confirms that the value \(-\frac{35}{9}\) is indeed the maximum possible value for the expression within the given constraints.

Thus, the maximum value of \(\frac{1}{b^2} - a^2\) is \(\boxed{-\dfrac{35}{9}}\).

<conclusion>
the expansion of the expression (a + 1/b)(1/b - a) yields the intermediate terms a/b, -a², 1/b², and -a/b.

so when i expand it:
(a + 1/b)(1/b - a) = (a)(1/b) + (a)(-a) + (1/b)(1/b) + (1/b)(-a)
simplify like terms:
the a(1/b) and the -a(1/b) would cancel each other out, right?
because one is positive a/b and the other is negative a/b.
so those two terms cancel.
then we have the other two terms: -a^2 and (1/b)^2.
so the expression simplifies to -a^2 + (1/b)^2.
so, that's -(a^2) + (1/b)^2.
hmm, okay.
so the expression simplifies to (1/b)^2 - a^2.
so, it's a difference between (1/b)^2 and a^2.
our goal is to maximize this difference.
so, to maximize (1/b)^2 - a^2, we need to either maximize (1/b)^2 or minimize a^2, or both.
but let's think about how these terms behave.

<conclusion>
the term (1/b)², with b ∈ [3,5], varies in the range [1/25, 1/9]. the term a², with a ∈ [-6,-2], varies in the range [4, 36], and its minimization is necessary for maximizing the expression (1/b)² - a².

so, to maximize (1/b)^2 - a^2, we need to:
maximize (1/b)^2: which happens when b is minimized, so b=3.
minimize a^2: which happens when a is closest to zero, so a=-2.
therefore, to get the maximum value, we should take b=3 and a=-2.
let's check that:
(1/b)^2 - a^2 = (1/3)^2 - (-2)^2 = 1/9 - 4 = (1 - 36)/9 = -35/9 ≈ -3.888...
but wait, is that the maximum?
wait, perhaps i need to check whether making (1/b)^2 bigger or making a^2 smaller has a greater impact.
wait, perhaps in some cases, if a^2 is large but (1/b)^2 is the largest possible, the negative term is larger, leading to a more positive result?
wait, no.
wait, the expression is (1/b)^2 - a^2.
so, to maximize this, we need to make the first term as large as possible and the second term as small as possible.
the first term (1/b)^2 is largest when b is as small as possible, so b=3.
the second term, a^2, is minimized when a is closest to zero, so a=-2.
therefore, the maximum should occur at b=3 and a=-2.
let's compute that:
(1/3)^2 - (-2)^2 = (1/9) - 4 = (1 - 36)/9 = -35/9 ≈ -3.888...
wait, but maybe if we take a more negative a, even though a^2 increases, if (1/b)^2 is sufficiently large?
for example, if we take b=3 (so (1/b)^2=1/9) but take a more negative, say a=-6.
then a^2=36.
so the expression would be 1/9 - 36 = (1 - 324)/9 = -323/9 ≈ -35.888...
which is much more negative, so indeed worse.
alternatively, if we take b=5, which makes (1/b)^2=1/25, but then even if we take a=-2, a^2=4, then the expression is 1/25 -4 = (1 - 100)/25 = -99/25 = -3.96, which is more negative than -35/9 (≈ -3.888...).
alternatively, maybe choosing different combinations?
for example, if we take b=3 (maximizing (1/b)^2) and a a bit more negative, say a=-3.
then a^2=9.
so expression is 1/9 -9 = (1 -81)/9= -80/9 ≈ -8.888...
which is worse.
alternatively, taking b=4.
then (1/4)^2=1/16.
if a=-2, a^2=4.
so 1/16 -4= (1 -64)/16= -63/16≈-3.9375.
still worse than -3.888...
alternatively, taking b=3 and a=-5.
then a^2=25.
(1/3)^2 -25=1/9 -25= (1 -225)/9=-224/9≈-24.888...
which is even worse.
so, indeed, the maximum seems to occur at b=3 and a=-2, giving -35/9.
wait, but is that the maximum?

2: the maximum value of (1/b)² is 1/9, occurring when b=3, and the minimum value of a² is 4, occurring when a=-2. the expression (1/b)² - a², evaluated at these boundary points (b=3, a=-2), results in 1/9 - 4 = -35/9. this value is negative. the expression is also evaluated at the opposite boundary points (b=5, a=-6), yielding (1/5)² - (-6)² = 1/25 - 36 = -899/25. this value is approximately -35.96, which is significantly more negative. the range of possible values for the expression is from -899/25 to -35/9.

<conclusion>
the expression (1/b)² - a², with (1/b)² ≤ 1/9 and a² ≥ 4, cannot be positive. evaluating the expression at the boundary points (b=3, a=-2) yields -35/9, and evaluating it at the opposite boundary points (b=5, a=-6) yields -899/25, establishing that the maximum value is -35/9 and the minimum value is -899/25.

wait, but in that case, the maximum value is -35/9.
wait, but is that really the maximum?
is there any combination of a and b where the expression becomes less negative, i.e., closer to zero?
for example, if we take a between -2 and -6?
wait, suppose a=-3.
then a^2=9.
if we take b=3, (1/b)^2=1/9.
so 1/9 -9= -80/9≈-8.888...
if we take b=5, (1/5)^2=1/25.
1/25 -9= -224/25≈-8.96.
so both worse.
alternatively, if a=-4, a^2=16.
b=3: 1/9 -16≈-15.777...
b=5: 1/25 -16≈-15.96...
so again, more negative.
wait, so for all a more negative than -2, even with the smallest b (which is b=3), the expression becomes more negative.
therefore, the maximum value is indeed achieved at a=-2 and b=3, with the value -35/9.
wait, but let me verify with another example.
let's check a=-2.5 (which is not allowed since a must be between -6 and -2, but in the original problem, the constraints are a is between -6 and -2, inclusive, right?
because the original problem says "if" the problem is presented with a and b in certain ranges.
wait, the original problem statement is not exactly clear.
wait, the original problem is: "solve the following math problem: if $a$ and $b$ are real numbers such that $-6 \leq a \leq -2$ and $3 \leq b \leq 5$, find the maximum value of $\frac{1}{b^2} - a^2$."
wait, actually, when i first saw the problem, it was presented in a box, but now in the revised version, it's in the prompt.
however, in the user's original message, they wrote: "solve the following math problem: if $-6 \leq a \leq -2$ and $3 \leq b \leq 5$, find the maximum value of $\frac{1}{b^2} - a^2$."
therefore, a is between -6 and -2, and b is between 3 and 5.
so, the variables a and b can take any real values within those intervals, and we need to find the maximum value of the expression (1/b^2) -a^2.
therefore, my previous analysis still holds.
the maximum value is achieved when 1/b^2 is as large as possible (i.e., b as small as possible, so b=3) and a^2 as small as possible (i.e., a as close to zero as possible, which is a=-2).
therefore, plugging in b=3 and a=-2, we get (1/3^2) - (-2)^2 = 1/9 -4= -35/9.
but, wait, this is negative.
is that correct?
wait, but is that really the maximum?
wait, perhaps the expression can take positive values?
for example, if 1/b^2 is larger than a^2.
however, given that a^2 is at least 4 (since a is at least -6, so a^2 is at least 4) and 1/b^2 is at most 1/9 (since b is at least 3, so 1/b^2 is at most 1/9).
since 1/9 is less than 4, the expression (1/b^2 -a^2) cannot be positive.
therefore, the maximum value is the least negative value, which is -35/9.
wait, but in mathematics, the least negative value is the maximum when all values are negative.
for example, between -1 and -10, -1 is the maximum.
therefore, in this case, since the expression can't be positive, the maximum value is the least negative one, which is -35/9.
therefore, the answer is -35/9.
but let me confirm once more.
suppose we take some values between the extremes.
let's take b=4 (middle of the interval [3,5]), so 1/b^2=1/16≈0.0625.
let's take a=-3, so a^2=9.
so expression is 0.0625 -9≈-8.9375.
compare to -35/9≈-3.888...
so much worse.
if we take a=-2.5, a^2=6.25.
then expression is 1/16 -6.25≈0.0625 -6.25≈-6.1875.
still worse.
alternatively, take b=3.5, so 1/b^2≈1/12.25≈0.0816.
take a=-2.5, so a^2=6.25.
expression≈0.0816 -6.25≈-6.1684.
still worse.
alternatively, take b=3. so 1/b^2=1/9≈0.1111.
take a=-2.5, a^2=6.25.
expression≈0.1111 -6.25≈-6.1389.
still worse.
but if we take a=-2 (the smallest a^2) and b=3 (the smallest b), we get 1/9 -4= -35/9≈-3.888...
so this is better than all the other combinations.
therefore, the maximum value is -35/9.
therefore, the answer is -35/9.
but, in the original calculation, when we computed (1/3)^2 - (-2)^2=1/9 -4, which is -35/9.
so, yes.
alternatively, to write as a fraction:
1/9 -4=1/9 -36/9= -35/9.
therefore, confirmed.
so the maximum value is -35/9.
hence, the final answer is -35/9.
**final answer**
\boxed{-\dfrac{35}{9}}

answer: to solve the problem of finding the maximum value of \(\frac{1}{b^2} - a^2\) given the constraints \(-6 \leq a \leq -2\) and \(3 \leq b \leq 5\), we need to analyze the expression and determine the values of \(a\) and \(b\) that maximize it.

1. **expression analysis**:
   - the expression is \(\frac{1}{b^2} - a^2\).
   - to maximize this, we need to maximize \(\frac{1}{b^2}\) and minimize \(a^2\).

2. **maximizing \(\frac{1}{b^2}\)**:
   - the term \(\frac{1}{b^2}\) is maximized when \(b\) is minimized because \(b\) is in the denominator.
   - the minimum value of \(b\) within the given range \(3 \leq b \leq 5\) is \(b = 3\).
   - therefore, \(\frac{1}{b^2}\) is maximized as \(\frac{1}{3^2} = \frac{1}{9}\).

3. **minimizing \(a^2\)**:
   - the term \(a^2\) is minimized when \(a\) is closest to zero.
   - the value of \(a\) closest to zero within the given range \(-6 \leq a \leq -2\) is \(a = -2\).
   - therefore, \(a^2\) is minimized as \((-2)^2 = 4\).

4. **combining the results**:
   - substituting \(b = 3\) and \(a = -2\) into the expression:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3^2} - (-2)^2 = \frac{1}{9} - 4
     \]
   - converting 4 to a fraction with a denominator of 9:
     \[
     \frac{1}{9} - \frac{36}{9} = -\frac{35}{9}
     \]

5. **verification**:
   - checking other combinations of \(a\) and \(b\) confirms that the value \(-\frac{35}{9}\) is indeed the maximum possible value for the expression within the given constraints.

thus, the maximum value of \(\frac{1}{b^2} - a^2\) is \(\boxed{-\dfrac{35}{9}}\)
