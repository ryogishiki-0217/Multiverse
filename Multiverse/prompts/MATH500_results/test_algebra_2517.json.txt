Okay, so I need to find the greatest possible value of the expression (a + 1/b)(1/b - a), where a is between -6 and -2, and b is between 3 and 5. And they want the answer as a common fraction. Hmm, let me start by expanding the expression to see if I can simplify it or something.

1: The product (a + 1/b)(1/b - a) is expanded by distributing each term in the first parenthesis to each term in the second. This results in the sum of four terms: a*(1/b), a*(-a), (1/b)*(1/b), and (1/b)*(-a). These terms simplify to a/b, -a^2, 1/b^2, and -1/b^2*a, respectively. Combining these simplified terms yields the expression a/b - a^2 + 1/b^2 - a/b^2.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The expression a(1/b) - a^2 + (1/b)^2 - (1/b)(a) is examined. The terms a(1/b) and -a(1/b) are identified as identical and therefore cancel each other out. This cancellation results in the simplified form -a^2 + (1/b)^2, which is equivalent to (1/b)^2 - a^2. The final simplified expression is (1/b)^2 - a^2.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The initial product (a + 1/b)(1/b - a) expands to a/b - a^2 + 1/b^2 - a/b^2. This expanded expression simplifies to (1/b)^2 - a^2, which is recognized as the difference of squares (1/b - a)(1/b + a).
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So the expression simplifies to (1/b)^2 - a^2. So, (1/b)^2 - a^2. That's a difference of squares. So, to maximize this expression, we need to maximize (1/b)^2 - a^2. Since a is negative, between -6 and -2, a^2 will be positive, between (-6)^2=36 and (-2)^2=4. So a^2 is between 4 and 36. So subtracting a^2 from (1/b)^2 means we want to minimize a^2 and maximize (1/b)^2 to get the largest possible value.

1: The term (1/b)^2 is considered. The variable b is constrained to the interval 3 ≤ b ≤ 5. The function 1/b is decreasing over this interval, meaning its maximum value occurs at the minimum value of b, and its minimum value occurs at the maximum value of b. When b=3, the value of 1/b is 1/3. When b=5, the value of 1/b is 1/5. Consequently, the range for 1/b is 1/5 to 1/3. Squaring this range, the term (1/b)^2 varies from (1/5)^2 = 1/25 up to (1/3)^2 = 1/9.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The term a^2 is examined, with a constrained to the interval -6 ≤ a ≤ -2. The minimum value of a^2 is found to be 4, occurring when a = -2, and the maximum value of a^2 is 36, occurring when a = -6.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The term (1/b)^2 ranges from 1/25 to 1/9, while the term a^2 ranges from 4 to 36.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Therefore, to maximize (1/b)^2 - a^2, we need to choose the maximum possible value of (1/b)^2, which is 1/9 (when b=3), and the minimum possible value of a^2, which is 4 (when a=-2). Therefore, substituting these values into (1/b)^2 - a^2 gives 1/9 - 4 = 1/9 - 36/9 = -35/9. Wait, that's negative. But is that the maximum possible? Wait, maybe I need to check. Wait, but if we take the maximum of (1/b)^2 and the minimum of a^2, that would give the maximum difference. But since (1/b)^2 is positive and a^2 is positive, so if we subtract a^2, which is positive, the maximum possible value would be when (1/b)^2 is as large as possible and a^2 is as small as possible. So 1/9 -4= -35/9. But maybe there's a way to get a higher value? Wait, perhaps not. Because if I take a smaller a^2 (like 4) and a larger (1/b)^2 (like 1/9), the difference is -35/9. If I take a larger a^2 (like 36) and a smaller (1/b)^2 (like 1/25), the difference would be 1/25 -36, which is even more negative. If I take intermediate values, maybe the difference could be less negative? Wait, maybe -35/9 is the least negative (the highest) value. Wait, the expression (1/b)^2 - a^2. Since a^2 is at least 4, and (1/b)^2 is at most 1/9, then (1/b)^2 -a^2 will always be negative, right? Because even if (1/b)^2 is 1/9, which is about 0.111, and a^2 is 4, which is 4. So 0.111 -4 = -3.888, which is -35/9 (-35 divided by 9 is about -3.888). If we take higher a^2, the difference becomes more negative. If we take smaller (1/b)^2, the difference also becomes more negative. Therefore, the maximum value of the expression is -35/9. But wait, is that right? Because the problem says "greatest possible value". So if all possible values are negative, the greatest would be the one closest to zero. But before concluding, let me check if that is achievable. So when is (1/b)^2 maximal? When b is minimal. So b=3. And when is a^2 minimal? When a is -2. So if we take a=-2 and b=3, then let's compute the original expression (a +1/b)(1/b -a). Let's compute that. a=-2, b=3. Compute (-2 +1/3)(1/3 - (-2)) = (-2 + 0.333...)(1/3 + 2) = (-1.666...)(2.333...) Let me compute that. -1.666... * 2.333... First, convert to fractions. -5/3 * 7/3 = (-5*7)/9 = -35/9. Yes, so that's -35/9. So that's the maximum. Wait, but is there a combination where maybe the terms partially offset each other less? Let's think. If we take a larger a (in absolute value), so a=-6, and b=5, then (a +1/b)(1/b -a) would be (-6 +1/5)(1/5 - (-6)) = (-6 +0.2)(0.2 +6) = (-5.8)(6.2). Wait, in decimal, that would be something like -35.8. Which is much more negative than -35/9 (which is approximately -3.888). So that's worse. If I take a=-2 and b=5, then (a +1/b)(1/b -a) = (-2 +1/5)(1/5 - (-2)) = (-2 +0.2)(0.2 + 2) = (-1.8)(2.2) = -3.96, which is -35/8.888... something, but that's more negative than -35/9. Wait, actually, 35/9 is approximately 3.888, so -35/9 is -3.888. If I take a=-2 and b=5, then the product is (-1.8)(2.2). 1.8*2.2 is 3.96, so it's negative -3.96, which is more negative than -3.888. Similarly, if I take a=-6 and b=3, then (-6 +1/3)(1/3 +6) = (-6 +0.333...)(0.333... +6) = (-5.666...)(6.333...) That's approximately -5.666 *6.333 which is going to be around -35.9. So again, much more negative. So indeed, the least negative value is when a=-2 and b=3, which gives -35/9. But wait, let me check another combination. What if a=-4 and b=4? Let's see. a=-4, b=4. Then (a +1/b)(1/b -a) = (-4 +1/4)(1/4 - (-4)) = (-4 +0.25)(0.25 +4) = (-3.75)(4.25). Let's compute that: -3.75*4.25. 3.75*4.25. 3*4.25=12.75, 0.75*4.25=3.1875, so total 15.9375. So negative of that is -15.9375. Which is -15.9375, which is -255/16, which is approximately -15.9375. Which is less negative than -3.888, so higher than -35/9. Wait, wait a minute. If this is the case, then the maximum is not -35/9 but something less negative? Wait, but that contradicts my previous conclusion. Wait, so when a=-4 and b=4, the expression becomes (-4 + 0.25)(0.25 - (-4)) = (-3.75)(4.25). Which is (-15/4)(17/4) = (-255)/16. Let's compute 255 divided by 16: 16*15=240, so 255-240=15, so 15/16. So 15.9375. So -255/16 ≈ -15.9375. But that's a larger number (less negative) than -35/9 ≈ -3.888. Wait, so that means that my initial reasoning was wrong. Wait, but if we can get -15.9375, which is less negative, that would actually be a higher value. So if I can get a higher value than -35/9, then my previous conclusion was wrong. So what's going on here. Wait, perhaps expanding the expression as (1/b)^2 - a^2 isn't necessarily the best way, maybe cross terms or something. Wait, no, I redid the expansion: (a + 1/b)(1/b -a) = a*(1/b) -a^2 + (1/b)^2 -a*(1/b) = (a*(1/b) -a*(1/b)) + ( -a^2 + (1/b)^2 ) = (0) + ( (1/b)^2 -a^2 ) = (1/b)^2 -a^2. So that's correct. So (1/b)^2 -a^2. So in the case where a=-4, b=4: (1/4)^2 - (-4)^2 = 1/16 -16 = (1 - 256)/16 = -255/16 ≈-15.9375. Which is indeed greater than -35/9 ≈-3.888. So that's a more negative number but a larger absolute value. Wait, but in terms of numerical value, -15.9375 is actually greater than -35/9? Wait, no. Wait, -15.9375 is more negative than -3.888, so it's numerically smaller. Wait, no, if something is more negative, it's of greater magnitude but lesser value. So for example, -100 is less than -10, even though 100 is greater than 10 in absolute value. Therefore, the value of the expression when a=-4 and b=4 is -255/16 ≈-15.9375, which is less than -35/9 ≈-3.888. Therefore, that's a lower value. So my previous example was incorrect. Wait, but that contradicts my calculation. Wait, when a=-4 and b=4, the expression is (-4 +1/4)(1/4 +4). Let me compute that again. First term: -4 + 0.25 = -3.75. Second term: 0.25 +4 = 4.25. Multiply them: -3.75 *4.25. 3.75 *4.25. 3*4.25=12.75, 0.75*4.25=3.1875, total 15.9375. So the product is -15.9375. And (1/4)^2 - (-4)^2 = 1/16 -16= (1 -256)/16= -255/16= -15.9375. That's correct. But -15.9375 is less than -35/9. Because -35/9 ≈-3.888, and -255/16≈-15.9375. So -15.9375 is more negative, so the value is lower. Therefore, the previous conclusion still holds. Therefore, the maximum value is indeed -35/9. Wait, so then why when I considered a=-4 and b=4, I got a lower value. So it's still the case that the maximum is -35/9. Therefore, my initial reasoning was correct. So perhaps the answer is -35/9. But the problem says "greatest possible value", so maybe they made a mistake and the answer is actually a positive number? Wait, but (1/b)^2 -a^2. Given that a is negative, but a^2 is positive, so (1/b)^2 -a^2 is like subtracting a positive number from (1/b)^2. Since (1/b)^2 is at maximum 1/9 and a^2 is at least 4, (1/9 -4) is negative. So all possible values are negative. Therefore, the least negative one is the greatest. So -35/9 is the answer. Alternatively, maybe the question is written differently? Wait, the original expression is (a +1/b)(1/b -a). Let me check the expansion again. (a +1/b)(1/b -a) = a*(1/b) -a^2 + (1/b)^2 -a*(1/b) = (a/b -a^2) + (1/b^2 -a/b). Then combining terms: the a/b and -a/b cancel, leaving -a^2 +1/b^2. So yes, that's correct. So it's 1/b^2 -a^2. So since both terms are positive and negative respectively. Therefore, to maximize this expression, we need to maximize 1/b^2 (so minimal b) and minimize a^2 (so minimal a in absolute value). So minimal |a| is 2 (since a is between -6 and -2, so the minimal a is -2, which is closest to zero. So a=-2, b=3 gives 1/9 -4 = -35/9. Therefore, that's correct. But let's confirm with another example. Let's say a=-3 and b=4. Compute (a +1/b)(1/b -a). So (-3 +1/4)(1/4 - (-3)) = (-3 +0.25)(0.25 +3) = (-2.75)(3.25) = (-11/4)(13/4) = -143/16 ≈-8.9375. Which is -143/16. Converting to ninths: 143/16 ≈ 8.9375, 35/9 ≈ 3.888. So -143/16 is more negative than -35/9, so indeed smaller. Hence, the maximum is -35/9. Wait, but to be thorough, maybe check the expression at all four corners of the rectangle defined by a and b. So the possible combinations when a is -6 and -2, b is 3 and 5. So four combinations: 1. a=-2, b=3: (a +1/b)(1/b -a) = (-2 +1/3)(1/3 +2) = (-5/3)(7/3)= -35/9 ≈-3.888 2. a=-2, b=5: (-2 +1/5)(1/5 +2) = (-9/5)(11/5)= -99/25 = -3.96 3. a=-6, b=3: (-6 +1/3)(1/3 +6)= (-17/3)(19/3)= -323/9 ≈-35.888 4. a=-6, b=5: (-6 +1/5)(1/5 +6)= (-29/5)(31/5)= -899/25 = -35.96 So indeed, the maximum occurs at the first case. Therefore, the maximum value is -35/9. But wait, the problem says "express your answer as a common fraction." -35/9 is a common fraction. But before finalizing that, did I consider all possibilities? Wait, but in calculus, sometimes maximums can occur at critical points inside the interval. But since a and b are independent variables each within their own intervals, but the expression is (1/b)^2 - a^2. So for each fixed b, as a function of a, it's concave down (since the coefficient is negative for a^2). Similarly, for each fixed a, as a function of b, it's 1/b^2 -a^2, which is also a concave down function in b (since 1/b^2 is convex, so negative of convex is concave). Therefore, the maximum of the expression over the rectangle [-6,-2]x[3,5] must occur at one of the four corners. Which is exactly what we checked above. So the maximum is indeed -35/9 at a=-2, b=3. Therefore, the answer is -35/9. But let me check once more. Let me take a=-3, b=3. So (a +1/b)(1/3 -a)= (-3 +1/3)(1/3 +3)= (-8/3)(10/3)= -80/9≈-8.888, which is worse than -35/9. Similarly, a=-2.5, b=4. Let's compute (a +1/b)(1/b -a). a=-2.5= -5/2, b=4. ( -5/2 +1/4 )(1/4 - (-5/2)) = (-10/4 +1/4)(1/4 +10/4) = (-9/4)(11/4)= -99/16≈-6.1875. Still worse. Alternatively, a=-2, b=3 is the best. So yes, the maximum is -35/9. But wait, the problem is presented as (a +1/b)(1/b -a). If I were to consider this as (1/b + a)(1/b -a) = (1/b)^2 -a^2. So difference of squares. So as per that, the maximum is when 1/b is largest (so b is smallest) and a is smallest in absolute value. So a closest to zero (so a=-2) and b=3. Then (1/3)^2 - (-2)^2=1/9 -4= -35/9. So that's correct. So final answer is -35/9. But let me check once more if there's any mistake here. Wait, the problem says "greatest possible value", but -35/9 is negative. So maybe the answer is positive? Wait, but (1/b)^2 -a^2, given that (1/b)^2 is at most 1/9 and a^2 is at least 4. So 1/9 -4 is negative. So all possible values are negative. Therefore, the greatest is the least negative. So that is -35/9. So written as a common fraction, it's -35/9. Therefore, the answer is -35/9. So the final answer is -35/9. But let me confirm the calculation once more. When a=-2 and b=3: (a +1/b)= -2 +1/3= -5/3. 1/b -a=1/3 -(-2)=1/3 +2=7/3. Multiply: (-5/3)(7/3)= -35/9. Correct. So yes. Therefore, the answer is -35/9. But wait, the problem says "express your answer as a common fraction," which it is. So I need to write "the final answer is -35/9".

Answer: To find the greatest possible value of the expression \(\left(a + \frac{1}{b}\right)\left(\frac{1}{b} - a\right)\) where \(-6 \leq a \leq -2\) and \(3 \leq b \leq 5\), we start by expanding the expression:

\[
\left(a + \frac{1}{b}\right)\left(\frac{1}{b} - a\right) = a \cdot \frac{1}{b} - a^2 + \left(\frac{1}{b}\right)^2 - a \cdot \frac{1}{b}
\]

Simplifying, the terms \(a \cdot \frac{1}{b}\) and \(-a \cdot \frac{1}{b}\) cancel each other out, leaving:

\[
\left(\frac{1}{b}\right)^2 - a^2
\]

To maximize \(\left(\frac{1}{b}\right)^2 - a^2\), we need to maximize \(\left(\frac{1}{b}\right)^2\) and minimize \(a^2\). The term \(\left(\frac{1}{b}\right)^2\) is maximized when \(b\) is minimized, which occurs at \(b = 3\). The term \(a^2\) is minimized when \(|a|\) is minimized, which occurs at \(a = -2\).

Substituting \(a = -2\) and \(b = 3\) into the expression:

\[
\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 - (-2)^2 = \frac{1}{9} - 4 = \frac{1}{9} - \frac{36}{9} = -\frac{35}{9}
\]

Thus, the greatest possible value of the expression is:

\[
\boxed{-\frac{35}{9}}
\]

the initial product (a + 1/b)(1/b - a) expands to a/b - a^2 + 1/b^2 - a/b^2. this expanded expression simplifies to (1/b)^2 - a^2, which is recognized as the difference of squares (1/b - a)(1/b + a).

so the expression simplifies to (1/b)^2 - a^2. so, (1/b)^2 - a^2. that's a difference of squares. so, to maximize this expression, we need to maximize (1/b)^2 - a^2. since a is negative, between -6 and -2, a^2 will be positive, between (-6)^2=36 and (-2)^2=4. so a^2 is between 4 and 36. so subtracting a^2 from (1/b)^2 means we want to minimize a^2 and maximize (1/b)^2 to get the largest possible value.

the term (1/b)^2 ranges from 1/25 to 1/9, while the term a^2 ranges from 4 to 36.

therefore, to maximize (1/b)^2 - a^2, we need to choose the maximum possible value of (1/b)^2, which is 1/9 (when b=3), and the minimum possible value of a^2, which is 4 (when a=-2). therefore, substituting these values into (1/b)^2 - a^2 gives 1/9 - 4 = 1/9 - 36/9 = -35/9. wait, that's negative. but is that the maximum possible? wait, maybe i need to check. wait, but if we take the maximum of (1/b)^2 and the minimum of a^2, that would give the maximum difference. but since (1/b)^2 is positive and a^2 is positive, so if we subtract a^2, which is positive, the maximum possible value would be when (1/b)^2 is as large as possible and a^2 is as small as possible. so 1/9 -4= -35/9. but maybe there's a way to get a higher value? wait, perhaps not. because if i take a smaller a^2 (like 4) and a larger (1/b)^2 (like 1/9), the difference is -35/9. if i take a larger a^2 (like 36) and a smaller (1/b)^2 (like 1/25), the difference would be 1/25 -36, which is even more negative. if i take intermediate values, maybe the difference could be less negative? wait, maybe -35/9 is the least negative (the highest) value. wait, the expression (1/b)^2 - a^2. since a^2 is at least 4, and (1/b)^2 is at most 1/9, then (1/b)^2 -a^2 will always be negative, right? because even if (1/b)^2 is 1/9, which is about 0.111, and a^2 is 4, which is 4. so 0.111 -4 = -3.888, which is -35/9 (-35 divided by 9 is about -3.888). if we take higher a^2, the difference becomes more negative. if we take smaller (1/b)^2, the difference also becomes more negative. therefore, the maximum value of the expression is -35/9. but wait, is that right? because the problem says "greatest possible value". so if all possible values are negative, the greatest would be the one closest to zero. but before concluding, let me check if that is achievable. so when is (1/b)^2 maximal? when b is minimal. so b=3. and when is a^2 minimal? when a is -2. so if we take a=-2 and b=3, then let's compute the original expression (a +1/b)(1/b -a). let's compute that. a=-2, b=3. compute (-2 +1/3)(1/3 - (-2)) = (-2 + 0.333...)(1/3 + 2) = (-1.666...)(2.333...) let me compute that. -1.666... * 2.333... first, convert to fractions. -5/3 * 7/3 = (-5*7)/9 = -35/9. yes, so that's -35/9. so that's the maximum. wait, but is there a combination where maybe the terms partially offset each other less? let's think. if we take a larger a (in absolute value), so a=-6, and b=5, then (a +1/b)(1/b -a) would be (-6 +1/5)(1/5 - (-6)) = (-6 +0.2)(0.2 +6) = (-5.8)(6.2). wait, in decimal, that would be something like -35.8. which is much more negative than -35/9 (which is approximately -3.888). so that's worse. if i take a=-2 and b=5, then (a +1/b)(1/b -a) = (-2 +1/5)(1/5 - (-2)) = (-2 +0.2)(0.2 + 2) = (-1.8)(2.2) = -3.96, which is -35/8.888... something, but that's more negative than -35/9. wait, actually, 35/9 is approximately 3.888, so -35/9 is -3.888. if i take a=-2 and b=5, then the product is (-1.8)(2.2). 1.8*2.2 is 3.96, so it's negative -3.96, which is more negative than -3.888. similarly, if i take a=-6 and b=3, then (-6 +1/3)(1/3 +6) = (-6 +0.333...)(0.333... +6) = (-5.666...)(6.333...) that's approximately -5.666 *6.333 which is going to be around -35.9. so again, much more negative. so indeed, the least negative value is when a=-2 and b=3, which gives -35/9. but wait, let me check another combination. what if a=-4 and b=4? let's see. a=-4, b=4. then (a +1/b)(1/b -a) = (-4 +1/4)(1/4 - (-4)) = (-4 +0.25)(0.25 +4) = (-3.75)(4.25). let's compute that: -3.75*4.25. 3.75*4.25. 3*4.25=12.75, 0.75*4.25=3.1875, so total 15.9375. so negative of that is -15.9375. which is -15.9375, which is -255/16, which is approximately -15.9375. which is less negative than -3.888, so higher than -35/9. wait, wait a minute. if this is the case, then the maximum is not -35/9 but something less negative? wait, but that contradicts my previous conclusion. wait, so when a=-4 and b=4, the expression becomes (-4 + 0.25)(0.25 - (-4)) = (-3.75)(4.25). which is (-15/4)(17/4) = (-255)/16. let's compute 255 divided by 16: 16*15=240, so 255-240=15, so 15/16. so 15.9375. so -255/16 ≈ -15.9375. but that's a larger number (less negative) than -35/9 ≈ -3.888. wait, so that means that my initial reasoning was wrong. wait, but if we can get -15.9375, which is less negative, that would actually be a higher value. so if i can get a higher value than -35/9, then my previous conclusion was wrong. so what's going on here. wait, perhaps expanding the expression as (1/b)^2 - a^2 isn't necessarily the best way, maybe cross terms or something. wait, no, i redid the expansion: (a + 1/b)(1/b -a) = a*(1/b) -a^2 + (1/b)^2 -a*(1/b) = (a*(1/b) -a*(1/b)) + ( -a^2 + (1/b)^2 ) = (0) + ( (1/b)^2 -a^2 ) = (1/b)^2 -a^2. so that's correct. so (1/b)^2 -a^2. so in the case where a=-4, b=4: (1/4)^2 - (-4)^2 = 1/16 -16 = (1 - 256)/16 = -255/16 ≈-15.9375. which is indeed greater than -35/9 ≈-3.888. so that's a more negative number but a larger absolute value. wait, but in terms of numerical value, -15.9375 is actually greater than -35/9? wait, no. wait, -15.9375 is more negative than -3.888, so it's numerically smaller. wait, no, if something is more negative, it's of greater magnitude but lesser value. so for example, -100 is less than -10, even though 100 is greater than 10 in absolute value. therefore, the value of the expression when a=-4 and b=4 is -255/16 ≈-15.9375, which is less than -35/9 ≈-3.888. therefore, that's a lower value. so my previous example was incorrect. wait, but that contradicts my calculation. wait, when a=-4 and b=4, the expression is (-4 +1/4)(1/4 +4). let me compute that again. first term: -4 + 0.25 = -3.75. second term: 0.25 +4 = 4.25. multiply them: -3.75 *4.25. 3.75 *4.25. 3*4.25=12.75, 0.75*4.25=3.1875, total 15.9375. so the product is -15.9375. and (1/4)^2 - (-4)^2 = 1/16 -16= (1 -256)/16= -255/16= -15.9375. that's correct. but -15.9375 is less than -35/9. because -35/9 ≈-3.888, and -255/16≈-15.9375. so -15.9375 is more negative, so the value is lower. therefore, the previous conclusion still holds. therefore, the maximum value is indeed -35/9. wait, so then why when i considered a=-4 and b=4, i got a lower value. so it's still the case that the maximum is -35/9. therefore, my initial reasoning was correct. so perhaps the answer is -35/9. but the problem says "greatest possible value", so maybe they made a mistake and the answer is actually a positive number? wait, but (1/b)^2 -a^2. given that a is negative, but a^2 is positive, so (1/b)^2 -a^2 is like subtracting a positive number from (1/b)^2. since (1/b)^2 is at maximum 1/9 and a^2 is at least 4, (1/9 -4) is negative. so all possible values are negative. therefore, the least negative one is the greatest. so -35/9 is the answer. alternatively, maybe the question is written differently? wait, the original expression is (a +1/b)(1/b -a). let me check the expansion again. (a +1/b)(1/b -a) = a*(1/b) -a^2 + (1/b)^2 -a*(1/b) = (a/b -a^2) + (1/b^2 -a/b). then combining terms: the a/b and -a/b cancel, leaving -a^2 +1/b^2. so yes, that's correct. so it's 1/b^2 -a^2. so since both terms are positive and negative respectively. therefore, to maximize this expression, we need to maximize 1/b^2 (so minimal b) and minimize a^2 (so minimal a in absolute value). so minimal |a| is 2 (since a is between -6 and -2, so the minimal a is -2, which is closest to zero. so a=-2, b=3 gives 1/9 -4 = -35/9. therefore, that's correct. but let's confirm with another example. let's say a=-3 and b=4. compute (a +1/b)(1/b -a). so (-3 +1/4)(1/4 - (-3)) = (-3 +0.25)(0.25 +3) = (-2.75)(3.25) = (-11/4)(13/4) = -143/16 ≈-8.9375. which is -143/16. converting to ninths: 143/16 ≈ 8.9375, 35/9 ≈ 3.888. so -143/16 is more negative than -35/9, so indeed smaller. hence, the maximum is -35/9. wait, but to be thorough, maybe check the expression at all four corners of the rectangle defined by a and b. so the possible combinations when a is -6 and -2, b is 3 and 5. so four combinations: 1. a=-2, b=3: (a +1/b)(1/b -a) = (-2 +1/3)(1/3 +2) = (-5/3)(7/3)= -35/9 ≈-3.888 2. a=-2, b=5: (-2 +1/5)(1/5 +2) = (-9/5)(11/5)= -99/25 = -3.96 3. a=-6, b=3: (-6 +1/3)(1/3 +6)= (-17/3)(19/3)= -323/9 ≈-35.888 4. a=-6, b=5: (-6 +1/5)(1/5 +6)= (-29/5)(31/5)= -899/25 = -35.96 so indeed, the maximum occurs at the first case. therefore, the maximum value is -35/9. but wait, the problem says "express your answer as a common fraction." -35/9 is a common fraction. but before finalizing that, did i consider all possibilities? wait, but in calculus, sometimes maximums can occur at critical points inside the interval. but since a and b are independent variables each within their own intervals, but the expression is (1/b)^2 - a^2. so for each fixed b, as a function of a, it's concave down (since the coefficient is negative for a^2). similarly, for each fixed a, as a function of b, it's 1/b^2 -a^2, which is also a concave down function in b (since 1/b^2 is convex, so negative of convex is concave). therefore, the maximum of the expression over the rectangle [-6,-2]x[3,5] must occur at one of the four corners. which is exactly what we checked above. so the maximum is indeed -35/9 at a=-2, b=3. therefore, the answer is -35/9. but let me check once more. let me take a=-3, b=3. so (a +1/b)(1/3 -a)= (-3 +1/3)(1/3 +3)= (-8/3)(10/3)= -80/9≈-8.888, which is worse than -35/9. similarly, a=-2.5, b=4. let's compute (a +1/b)(1/b -a). a=-2.5= -5/2, b=4. ( -5/2 +1/4 )(1/4 - (-5/2)) = (-10/4 +1/4)(1/4 +10/4) = (-9/4)(11/4)= -99/16≈-6.1875. still worse. alternatively, a=-2, b=3 is the best. so yes, the maximum is -35/9. but wait, the problem is presented as (a +1/b)(1/b -a). if i were to consider this as (1/b + a)(1/b -a) = (1/b)^2 -a^2. so difference of squares. so as per that, the maximum is when 1/b is largest (so b is smallest) and a is smallest in absolute value. so a closest to zero (so a=-2) and b=3. then (1/3)^2 - (-2)^2=1/9 -4= -35/9. so that's correct. so final answer is -35/9. but let me check once more if there's any mistake here. wait, the problem says "greatest possible value", but -35/9 is negative. so maybe the answer is positive? wait, but (1/b)^2 -a^2, given that (1/b)^2 is at most 1/9 and a^2 is at least 4. so 1/9 -4 is negative. so all possible values are negative. therefore, the greatest is the least negative. so that is -35/9. so written as a common fraction, it's -35/9. therefore, the answer is -35/9. so the final answer is -35/9. but let me confirm the calculation once more. when a=-2 and b=3: (a +1/b)= -2 +1/3= -5/3. 1/b -a=1/3 -(-2)=1/3 +2=7/3. multiply: (-5/3)(7/3)= -35/9. correct. so yes. therefore, the answer is -35/9. but wait, the problem says "express your answer as a common fraction," which it is. so i need to write "the final answer is -35/9".

answer: to find the greatest possible value of the expression \(\left(a + \frac{1}{b}\right)\left(\frac{1}{b} - a\right)\) where \(-6 \leq a \leq -2\) and \(3 \leq b \leq 5\), we start by expanding the expression:

\[
\left(a + \frac{1}{b}\right)\left(\frac{1}{b} - a\right) = a \cdot \frac{1}{b} - a^2 + \left(\frac{1}{b}\right)^2 - a \cdot \frac{1}{b}
\]

simplifying, the terms \(a \cdot \frac{1}{b}\) and \(-a \cdot \frac{1}{b}\) cancel each other out, leaving:

\[
\left(\frac{1}{b}\right)^2 - a^2
\]

to maximize \(\left(\frac{1}{b}\right)^2 - a^2\), we need to maximize \(\left(\frac{1}{b}\right)^2\) and minimize \(a^2\). the term \(\left(\frac{1}{b}\right)^2\) is maximized when \(b\) is minimized, which occurs at \(b = 3\). the term \(a^2\) is minimized when \(|a|\) is minimized, which occurs at \(a = -2\).

substituting \(a = -2\) and \(b = 3\) into the expression:

\[
\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 - (-2)^2 = \frac{1}{9} - 4 = \frac{1}{9} - \frac{36}{9} = -\frac{35}{9}
\]

thus, the greatest possible value of the expression is:

\[
\boxed{-\frac{35}{9}}
\]
