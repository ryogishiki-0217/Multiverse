<Think>
Okay, so I need to solve the equation 3^(2x) + 19 = 10^x for x.
Hmm, let's see.
Let me start by trying to understand the equation.
We have 3 raised to the power of 2x, plus 19, equals 10 raised to the power of x.
First, I recall that 3^(2x) can be rewritten as (3^2)^x, which is 9^x.
So, the equation becomes 9^x + 19 = 10^x.
That seems like a useful simplification.
Let me write that again: 9^x + 19 = 10^x.
Now, I need to solve for x.
Hmm, exponential equations.
Let's think about how to handle these.
I know that when dealing with equations that have exponentials with the same base, it's often easier, but here we have different bases, 9 and 10.
So maybe I should take the natural logarithm of both sides?
But there's a problem here because we have 9^x + 19 = 10^x.
Taking the log directly might not help because of the addition.
Let's see.
Maybe I can rearrange the equation to get all terms with x on one side and the constants on the other.
So, let's subtract 9^x from both sides:
19 = 10^x - 9^x.
Hmm, not sure that helps.
Alternatively, perhaps divide both sides by 10^x?
That gives:
(9^x / 10^x) + (19 / 10^x) = 1.
Which simplifies to (9/10)^x + 19 * 10^(-x) = 1.
Hmm, not sure.
Let me think.
Let me try substituting y = 10^x.
Then, 9^x = (9/10)^x * 10^x = (9/10)^x * y.
So the equation becomes (9/10)^x * y + 19 = y.
But since y = 10^x, we also have (10^x) = y, so (9/10)^x = y^(ln(9/10)/ln(10)).
Wait, that might complicate things more.
Maybe substitution is not the best way here.
Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to manipulate the equation to write it in terms of some common base.
Let's think.
Wait, 9 and 10 aren't powers of the same base, so that might not work.
Alternatively, maybe we can rearrange the equation and try to take logarithms.
Let me think again.
Starting from 9^x + 19 = 10^x.
If I move 9^x to the other side:
10^x - 9^x = 19.
Hmm.
Is there a way to factor or simplify this?
Alternatively, maybe divide both sides by 10^x:
(10^x - 9^x)/10^x = 19/10^x
Which simplifies to 1 - (9/10)^x = 19 * 10^(-x)
Hmm, perhaps rearrange terms:
1 = (9/10)^x + 19 * 10^(-x)
Wait, this seems similar to what I had before.
Hmm.
Maybe if I let y = (9/10)^x, then 10^(-x) would be (10/9)^(-x) * 9^(-x)?
Wait, perhaps not.
Let me see.
Alternatively, if I set y = 10^x, then 9^x = (9/10)^x * y.
So the equation becomes 1 = (9/10)^x * y + 19.
But since y = 10^x, and so (9/10)^x = y^(ln(9/10)/ln(10)), as I thought before.
This seems to complicate the equation more into something with y and logarithms, maybe not helpful.
Let me check if there's a way to linearize the equation by taking logarithms.
Wait, the problem is the sum of two exponential terms.
In general, equations with the sum of exponentials are difficult to solve algebraically because logarithms don't distribute over addition.
So unless there's some specific relationship between the terms, which I don't see here, maybe an algebraic solution isn't possible?
Wait, but this is a math problem given to me, so perhaps there is a trick here?
Let me check.
Let me try specific values for x to see if there's an integer solution.
Let's try x=0: 3^(0) +19 =1+19=20, 10^0=1. 20≠1, so not 0.
x=1: 3^2 +19=9+19=28, 10^1=10. 28≠10.
x=2: 3^4 +19=81+19=100, 10^2=100. Oh! Wait, 100=100.
So x=2 is a solution.
Let me verify.
Original equation: 3^(2x) +19 =10^x.
If x=2, then 3^(4)=81, 81 +19=100.
10^2=100.
Yes, that works.
So x=2 is a solution.
Now, is that the only solution?
Let's analyze.
Let me consider the function f(x) = 9^x +19 -10^x.
We need to find f(x)=0.
At x=2, f(x)=0.
Let me check the behavior of f(x) around x=2.
Take the derivative f’(x) = 9^x * ln(9) -10^x * ln(10).
At x=2, f’(x)=81*ln(9) -100*ln(10).
Since ln(9) = 2 ln(3) ≈ 2*1.0986≈2.1972, so 81*2.1972≈177.95.
100*ln(10)≈100*2.3026≈230.26.
So f’(2)≈177.95 -230.26≈-52.31, which is negative.
So at x=2, the function is decreasing.
Let's check for other possible solutions.
Let me check when x is less than 2.
Let's try x=1: f(1)=9 +19 -10=18.
x=0:1+19 -1=19.
x=3: 9^3=729 +19=748, 10^3=1000, so 748 -1000= -252.
So between x=2 and x=3, the function goes from 0 to -252.
For x less than 2, like x=1 gives 18, so positive.
So the function is positive for x around 1 and around x=2 it crosses zero.
But since the derivative at x=2 is negative, the function is decreasing there.
Wait, so from x=1 where f(x)=18, at x=2 it's zero.
Then between x=1 and x=2, the function decreases from 18 to 0.
Then beyond x=2, like at x=3, it's already negative, going down to -252.
Wait, so does the function cross zero again somewhere else?
Let me check for x less than 1.
Wait, at x=1, f(x)=18.
At x=0, f(x)=19.
Then as x approaches negative infinity, 9^x and 10^x both approach 0, so f(x) approaches 0 +19 -0=19.
So as x→-∞, f(x) approaches 19.
So the function starts at 19 when x is very small, decreases towards 19 as x increases, but at x=1 it's 18, lower than 19.
Wait, but how does it behave?
Wait, maybe as x increases from negative infinity, the function starts at 19 and then decreases towards 18 at x=1, then decreases more to 0 at x=2, then continues decreasing to negative values.
So in that case, x=2 is the only root.
Wait, but how about for higher x?
At x=2, f(x)=0.
At x=3, f(x)=-252.
At x=4, 9^4=6561 +19=6580, 10^4=10000, so f(4)=6580 -10000= -3420.
So it's decreasing rapidly for x >2.
For x less than 2, between x=1 and x=2, f(x) goes from 18 to 0.
Wait, but is there another point where the function crosses zero?
Let me check x=5: 9^5=59049 +19=59068, 10^5=100000, so f(5)= -40932.
Still negative.
How about fractional values between 1 and 2?
Wait, at x=1, f(x)=18.
At x=2, f(x)=0.
So the function is decreasing from 18 to 0 as x goes from 1 to 2.
Since it's decreasing and continuous, there should be only one solution at x=2.
Wait, let's confirm with x=1.5.
Compute f(1.5)=9^1.5 +19 -10^1.5.
9^1.5=9^(3/2)=sqrt(9)^3=3^3=27.
10^1.5= sqrt(10)*10≈3.162*10=31.623.
So f(1.5)=27 +19 -31.623≈46 -31.623≈14.377.
So still positive.
So between x=1.5 and x=2, f(x) decreases from ~14.377 to 0.
At x=1.9, let's compute f(1.9).
First, 9^1.9.
Hmm, 9^1=9, 9^2=81.
1.9 is 0.9 into the exponent.
Maybe approximate.
Let me use logarithms.
ln(9^1.9)=1.9*ln9≈1.9*2.197≈4.174.
So 9^1.9≈exp(4.174)≈64.0.
Similarly, 10^1.9=exp(1.9*ln10)≈exp(1.9*2.3026)≈exp(4.375)≈87.7.
Thus, f(1.9)≈64 +19 -87.7≈83 -87.7≈-4.7.
So at x=1.9, f(x) is already negative.
So between x=1.9 and x=2, the function crosses zero.
Wait, but we already know at x=2 it's zero.
But according to the calculation at x=1.9, f(x)≈-4.7.
Wait, but that suggests that the function might cross zero somewhere between x=1.9 and x=2?
Wait, but we know at x=2 it's exactly zero.
Wait, but maybe due to precision?
Wait, perhaps my approximations are a bit off.
Let me check with x=2.
At x=2, 9^2=81, 10^2=100.
So 81 +19=100, which is exactly 100.
So f(2)=0.
But when x is less than 2, like at x=1, f(x)=18, at x=1.5 it's ~14, at x=1.75?
Let me check.
x=1.75: 9^1.75.
Let's compute ln(9^1.75)=1.75*ln9≈1.75*2.197≈3.845.
So exp(3.845)≈46.7.
10^1.75: ln(10^1.75)=1.75*ln10≈1.75*2.302≈4.028.
exp(4.028)≈55.7.
Thus, f(1.75)=46.7 +19 -55.7≈10.0.
Still positive.
At x=1.8: 9^1.8: ln(9^1.8)=1.8*ln9≈1.8*2.197≈3.955.
exp(3.955)=52.3.
10^1.8= exp(1.8*ln10)=exp(1.8*2.302)=exp(4.144)=66.0.
So f(1.8)=52.3 +19 -66.0≈5.3.
Still positive.
At x=1.9: 9^1.9≈ as before, 9^1.9≈64.0.
10^1.9≈87.7.
So f(1.9)=64.0 +19 -87.7≈-14.7.
Wait, so f(1.8)=5.3 and f(1.9)= -14.7.
So by the Intermediate Value Theorem, since f is continuous, there must be a root between x=1.8 and x=1.9 where f(x)=0.
But we already know that f(2)=0.
So this suggests that the function crosses zero again between x=1.8 and x=1.9?
Wait, but that contradicts with the idea that x=2 is the only solution.
Wait, but that can't be.
Wait, perhaps my calculation is wrong.
Wait, if x=1.8 gives f(x)=5.3, x=1.9 gives f(x)=-4.7, then the function crosses zero between x=1.8 and x=1.9.
But we know f(2)=0, so that would imply there are two roots.
But that's impossible because the function is convex or concave?
Let's check the second derivative.
Let me compute the first and second derivatives of f(x) = 9^x + 19 -10^x.
First derivative f’(x) = 9^x ln9 -10^x ln10.
Second derivative f''(x) = 9^x (ln9)^2 -10^x (ln10)^2.
At x=2, f''(2) = 81*(ln9)^2 - 100*(ln10)^2 ≈ 81*(2.197)^2 -100*(2.302)^2 ≈ 81*4.827 -100*5.300 ≈ 390.4 -530 ≈ -139.6.
So the second derivative is negative at x=2, meaning the function is concave down at that point.
Wait, but if the function is concave down at x=2, and if there's another root near x=1.85, then the function would need to turn around.
Wait, but according to the calculations, f(1.8)=5.3, f(1.9)≈-4.7.
So the function crosses zero between x=1.8 and x=1.9.
But wait, at x=2, f(x)=0 again.
So that would mean the function crosses zero three times?
But that can't be for a concave function.
Wait, perhaps my calculations are wrong.
Wait, let's check f(1.9).
Wait, 9^1.9: 9^1=9, 9^2=81, so 9^1.9 is just below 81.
Let me compute 9^1.9 more accurately.
Take logarithms: ln(9^1.9)=1.9*ln9≈1.9*2.197≈4.174.
So exp(4.174)≈64.0.
Then 10^1.9: 10^1=10, 10^2=100.
1.9 is close to 2.
ln(10^1.9)=1.9*ln10≈1.9*2.302≈4.375.
exp(4.375)= 4.375 is ln(87.7), so 10^1.9≈87.7.
So f(1.9)=64.0 +19 -87.7≈93.0 -87.7≈5.3.
Wait, so f(1.9)=approx5.3?
But that contradicts my previous quick calculation.
Wait, let's compute 9^1.9 first.
Wait, 9^1.9 = 9^(1 +0.9)=9*9^0.9.
9^0.9=exp(0.9 ln9)=exp(0.9*2.197)=exp(1.977)≈7.22.
So 9*7.22≈65.0.
Then 10^1.9=10^(1 +0.9)=10*10^0.9.
10^0.9≈exp(0.9*2.302)=exp(2.072)=7.91.
So 10*7.91≈79.1.
Thus, f(1.9)=65.0 +19 -79.1≈84.0 -79.1≈4.9.
Hmm, so f(1.9)=≈4.9, still positive.
Wait, so my previous calculation was a bit off due to estimation.
At x=2, f(x)=0.
Wait, at x=2.1: let's check.
9^2.1: 9^(2 +0.1)=9^2*9^0.1=81*9^0.1.
9^0.1≈exp(0.1*2.197)=exp(0.2197)=1.244.
So 81*1.244≈100.7.
10^2.1=10^2*10^0.1=100*10^0.1≈100*1.2589≈125.89.
Thus, f(2.1)=100.7 +19 -125.89≈119.7 -125.89≈-6.19.
So f(2.1)=≈-6.19.
So between x=2.0 and x=2.1, f(x) goes from 0 to -6.19.
But if at x=2, f(x)=0, and nearby points are positive at lower x and negative at higher x.
Wait, but then between x=1.9 and x=2.0, f(x) goes from ≈4.9 to 0.
So the function approaches zero from positive side as x increases to 2, then beyond x=2, it's negative.
So the function crosses zero only once at x=2.
But earlier when x=1.9, f(x)≈4.9, which is positive.
Wait, but as x increases from 1.9 to 2.0, f(x) decreases from 4.9 to 0.
So the only root is at x=2.
Wait, but that means when x=1.9, the function is positive, and at x=2.0, it's zero.
So how does it get from 4.9 to 0?
Is the function decreasing there.
So the function is smooth, so between x=1.9 and x=2.0, f(x) decreases from 4.9 to 0.
Thus, x=2 is the only solution.
But wait, if that's the case, then why when I checked x=1.9, x=2.0 gave f(x)=0, but x=2.1 is already -6.19.
Wait, but maybe there is only one real solution at x=2.
Then why when I checked x=1.9, f(x) is positive, and at x=2.0 it's zero, x=2.1 it's negative.
So the function crosses zero only once at x=2.
Therefore, x=2 is the only real solution.
So maybe there was a miscalculation earlier when I thought there might be another root.
But that was due to incorrect approximations.
So in reality, the function only crosses zero once at x=2.
Therefore, the only solution is x=2.
Alternatively, let's think about the behavior of the function 9^x + 19 - 10^x.
As x increases, the 10^x term grows faster than the 9^x term, right?
Because 10^x grows faster than 9^x.
So after x=2, the 10^x term dominates, making the whole expression negative.
For x less than 2, the 9^x term is not dominant enough, but the combination 9^x +19 can exceed 10^x until a certain point.
But we saw at x=2, they balance, and for x less than 2, 9^x +19 is greater, and for x greater than 2, 10^x is greater.
Wait, but when x is less than 2, at x=1, 9^1 +19=28, 10^1=10, so 28>10.
At x=2, 9^2 +19=100, 10^2=100, equal.
For x>2, 10^x grows faster.
So the function 9^x +19 -10^x is positive for x<2, zero at x=2, and negative for x>2.
Therefore, x=2 is the only solution.
Therefore, the equation has only one solution, x=2.
But just to confirm, let's check another value for x less than 2, maybe x=1.5.
At x=1.5, 9^1.5=27, as before, plus 19=46, 10^1.5≈31.62, so 46>31.62.
Hence, f(x)=46 -31.62≈14.38>0.
So indeed, positive.
Therefore, the function is positive for x<2, zero at x=2, and negative for x>2.
Thus, x=2 is the only solution.
Therefore, the answer is x=2.
Wait, but let me check once more.
Suppose someone claims there might be a solution where x is negative.
Let's check.
Let x=-1.
Then 3^(2x)=3^(-2)=1/9, and 10^x=10^(-1)=1/10.
So left side: 1/9 +19≈20.111, right side: 0.1.
So 20.111 vs 0.1.
Not equal.
For x=-2, left side: 3^(-4) +19≈(1/81) +19≈19.012, right side: 10^(-2)=0.01.
So 19.012 vs 0.01.
Not equal.
As x approaches negative infinity, 3^(2x) approaches 0, 10^x approaches 0, so left side approaches 0 +19=19, right side approaches 0.
So equation becomes 19=0, which is never true.
Therefore, no solution for x negative.
Therefore, x=2 is the only solution.
Alternatively, another approach.
Let me rearrange the original equation: 9^x +19=10^x.
Let me write this as 10^x -9^x=19.
Let me consider the function g(x)=10^x -9^x.
We need to find x such that g(x)=19.
Compute g(2)=100 -81=19.
So that works.
Now, let's check the monotonicity of g(x).
g’(x)=10^x ln10 -9^x ln9.
At x=2, g’(2)=100 ln10 -81 ln9≈100*2.3026 -81*2.197≈230.26 -177.75≈52.51>0.
Wait, earlier when I considered f(x)=9^x +19 -10^x, f’(2) was negative.
But here, g(x) is 10^x -9^x, so g’(x)=10^x ln10 -9^x ln9.
Let's see.
At x=2, g’(2)=100*ln10 -81*ln9≈100*2.3026 -81*2.197≈230.26 -177.95≈52.31>0.
Wait, so if g(x)=10^x -9^x, then g(x)=19.
At x=2, g(2)=19.
And g’(x) is positive for x>2?
Let me check.
For x>2, 10^x ln10 grows faster than 9^x ln9, so g’(x) would be positive?
Wait, but actually, 10^x grows faster than 9^x, so their difference derivative g’(x) would be positive?
Wait, if g’(x)=10^x ln10 -9^x ln9, then as x increases, 10^x ln10 increases faster than 9^x ln9, because the base 10 is larger.
So g’(x) would be increasing?
Wait, so g’(x) is increasing.
Therefore, since at x=2, g’(2)≈52.31>0, and since g’(x) is increasing for x>2, g’(x) will be positive for all x>2.
Therefore, g(x) is increasing for x>2.
But wait, if x=2 is where g(x)=19, and if g(x) is increasing for x>2, then there can be no solution for x>2, since g(x) would be increasing above 19.
However, when I checked x=3, g(3)=1000 -729=271>19.
So that's consistent.
But then, how does g(x) behave for x<2?
Let me check g(1)=10 -9=1.
So from x=1 to x=2, g(x) increases from 1 to 19.
Therefore, since g(x) is increasing for x>2 and for x<2?
Wait, but wait, let's compute g’(x) at x=1: 10^1 ln10 -9^1 ln9≈10*2.3026 -9*2.197≈23.026 -19.773≈3.253>0.
So at x=1, g’(x) is positive.
Similarly, at x=0, g’(0)=1*ln10 -1*ln9≈0.105>0.
Therefore, g’(x) is positive for all x.
Therefore, g(x) is strictly increasing.
Therefore, the equation g(x)=19 has exactly one solution, which is at x=2.
Therefore, the only solution is x=2.
That makes sense.
So even though I initially thought there might be another root due to a miscalculation, in reality, since g(x)=10^x -9^x is strictly increasing, the equation g(x)=19 has only one solution.
Therefore, the answer is x=2.
**Final Answer**
\boxed{2}
</Think>

Answer: To solve the equation \(3^{2x} + 19 = 10^x\) for \(x\), we start by simplifying the left-hand side. Recognizing that \(3^{2x} = (3^2)^x = 9^x\), the equation becomes:

\[9^x + 19 = 10^x\]

Next, we rearrange the equation to isolate the exponential terms:

\[10^x - 9^x = 19\]

We define the function \(g(x) = 10^x - 9^x\) and need to find the value of \(x\) for which \(g(x) = 19\). 

To analyze the behavior of \(g(x)\), we compute its derivative:

\[g'(x) = 10^x \ln 10 - 9^x \ln 9\]

We observe that both \(10^x \ln 10\) and \(-9^x \ln 9\) are increasing functions because the exponential functions \(10^x\) and \(9^x\) are increasing, and their derivatives maintain the same sign. Therefore, \(g'(x)\) is positive for all \(x\), indicating that \(g(x)\) is strictly increasing.

Given that \(g(x)\) is strictly increasing, there can be at most one solution to the equation \(g(x) = 19\). We test \(x = 2\):

\[g(2) = 10^2 - 9^2 = 100 - 81 = 19\]

Thus, \(x = 2\) is indeed a solution. Since \(g(x)\) is strictly increasing, this is the only solution.

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[\boxed{2}\]

<think>
okay, so i need to solve the equation 3^(2x) + 19 = 10^x for x.
hmm, let's see.
let me start by trying to understand the equation.
we have 3 raised to the power of 2x, plus 19, equals 10 raised to the power of x.
first, i recall that 3^(2x) can be rewritten as (3^2)^x, which is 9^x.
so, the equation becomes 9^x + 19 = 10^x.
that seems like a useful simplification.
let me write that again: 9^x + 19 = 10^x.
now, i need to solve for x.
hmm, exponential equations.
let's think about how to handle these.
i know that when dealing with equations that have exponentials with the same base, it's often easier, but here we have different bases, 9 and 10.
so maybe i should take the natural logarithm of both sides?
but there's a problem here because we have 9^x + 19 = 10^x.
taking the log directly might not help because of the addition.
let's see.
maybe i can rearrange the equation to get all terms with x on one side and the constants on the other.
so, let's subtract 9^x from both sides:
19 = 10^x - 9^x.
hmm, not sure that helps.
alternatively, perhaps divide both sides by 10^x?
that gives:
(9^x / 10^x) + (19 / 10^x) = 1.
which simplifies to (9/10)^x + 19 * 10^(-x) = 1.
hmm, not sure.
let me think.
let me try substituting y = 10^x.
then, 9^x = (9/10)^x * 10^x = (9/10)^x * y.
so the equation becomes (9/10)^x * y + 19 = y.
but since y = 10^x, we also have (10^x) = y, so (9/10)^x = y^(ln(9/10)/ln(10)).
wait, that might complicate things more.
maybe substitution is not the best way here.
alternatively, perhaps there's a way to manipulate the equation to write it in terms of some common base.
let's think.
wait, 9 and 10 aren't powers of the same base, so that might not work.
alternatively, maybe we can rearrange the equation and try to take logarithms.
let me think again.
starting from 9^x + 19 = 10^x.
if i move 9^x to the other side:
10^x - 9^x = 19.
hmm.
is there a way to factor or simplify this?
alternatively, maybe divide both sides by 10^x:
(10^x - 9^x)/10^x = 19/10^x
which simplifies to 1 - (9/10)^x = 19 * 10^(-x)
hmm, perhaps rearrange terms:
1 = (9/10)^x + 19 * 10^(-x)
wait, this seems similar to what i had before.
hmm.
maybe if i let y = (9/10)^x, then 10^(-x) would be (10/9)^(-x) * 9^(-x)?
wait, perhaps not.
let me see.
alternatively, if i set y = 10^x, then 9^x = (9/10)^x * y.
so the equation becomes 1 = (9/10)^x * y + 19.
but since y = 10^x, and so (9/10)^x = y^(ln(9/10)/ln(10)), as i thought before.
this seems to complicate the equation more into something with y and logarithms, maybe not helpful.
let me check if there's a way to linearize the equation by taking logarithms.
wait, the problem is the sum of two exponential terms.
in general, equations with the sum of exponentials are difficult to solve algebraically because logarithms don't distribute over addition.
so unless there's some specific relationship between the terms, which i don't see here, maybe an algebraic solution isn't possible?
wait, but this is a math problem given to me, so perhaps there is a trick here?
let me check.
let me try specific values for x to see if there's an integer solution.
let's try x=0: 3^(0) +19 =1+19=20, 10^0=1. 20≠1, so not 0.
x=1: 3^2 +19=9+19=28, 10^1=10. 28≠10.
x=2: 3^4 +19=81+19=100, 10^2=100. oh! wait, 100=100.
so x=2 is a solution.
let me verify.
original equation: 3^(2x) +19 =10^x.
if x=2, then 3^(4)=81, 81 +19=100.
10^2=100.
yes, that works.
so x=2 is a solution.
now, is that the only solution?
let's analyze.
let me consider the function f(x) = 9^x +19 -10^x.
we need to find f(x)=0.
at x=2, f(x)=0.
let me check the behavior of f(x) around x=2.
take the derivative f’(x) = 9^x * ln(9) -10^x * ln(10).
at x=2, f’(x)=81*ln(9) -100*ln(10).
since ln(9) = 2 ln(3) ≈ 2*1.0986≈2.1972, so 81*2.1972≈177.95.
100*ln(10)≈100*2.3026≈230.26.
so f’(2)≈177.95 -230.26≈-52.31, which is negative.
so at x=2, the function is decreasing.
let's check for other possible solutions.
let me check when x is less than 2.
let's try x=1: f(1)=9 +19 -10=18.
x=0:1+19 -1=19.
x=3: 9^3=729 +19=748, 10^3=1000, so 748 -1000= -252.
so between x=2 and x=3, the function goes from 0 to -252.
for x less than 2, like x=1 gives 18, so positive.
so the function is positive for x around 1 and around x=2 it crosses zero.
but since the derivative at x=2 is negative, the function is decreasing there.
wait, so from x=1 where f(x)=18, at x=2 it's zero.
then between x=1 and x=2, the function decreases from 18 to 0.
then beyond x=2, like at x=3, it's already negative, going down to -252.
wait, so does the function cross zero again somewhere else?
let me check for x less than 1.
wait, at x=1, f(x)=18.
at x=0, f(x)=19.
then as x approaches negative infinity, 9^x and 10^x both approach 0, so f(x) approaches 0 +19 -0=19.
so as x→-∞, f(x) approaches 19.
so the function starts at 19 when x is very small, decreases towards 19 as x increases, but at x=1 it's 18, lower than 19.
wait, but how does it behave?
wait, maybe as x increases from negative infinity, the function starts at 19 and then decreases towards 18 at x=1, then decreases more to 0 at x=2, then continues decreasing to negative values.
so in that case, x=2 is the only root.
wait, but how about for higher x?
at x=2, f(x)=0.
at x=3, f(x)=-252.
at x=4, 9^4=6561 +19=6580, 10^4=10000, so f(4)=6580 -10000= -3420.
so it's decreasing rapidly for x >2.
for x less than 2, between x=1 and x=2, f(x) goes from 18 to 0.
wait, but is there another point where the function crosses zero?
let me check x=5: 9^5=59049 +19=59068, 10^5=100000, so f(5)= -40932.
still negative.
how about fractional values between 1 and 2?
wait, at x=1, f(x)=18.
at x=2, f(x)=0.
so the function is decreasing from 18 to 0 as x goes from 1 to 2.
since it's decreasing and continuous, there should be only one solution at x=2.
wait, let's confirm with x=1.5.
compute f(1.5)=9^1.5 +19 -10^1.5.
9^1.5=9^(3/2)=sqrt(9)^3=3^3=27.
10^1.5= sqrt(10)*10≈3.162*10=31.623.
so f(1.5)=27 +19 -31.623≈46 -31.623≈14.377.
so still positive.
so between x=1.5 and x=2, f(x) decreases from ~14.377 to 0.
at x=1.9, let's compute f(1.9).
first, 9^1.9.
hmm, 9^1=9, 9^2=81.
1.9 is 0.9 into the exponent.
maybe approximate.
let me use logarithms.
ln(9^1.9)=1.9*ln9≈1.9*2.197≈4.174.
so 9^1.9≈exp(4.174)≈64.0.
similarly, 10^1.9=exp(1.9*ln10)≈exp(1.9*2.3026)≈exp(4.375)≈87.7.
thus, f(1.9)≈64 +19 -87.7≈83 -87.7≈-4.7.
so at x=1.9, f(x) is already negative.
so between x=1.9 and x=2, the function crosses zero.
wait, but we already know at x=2 it's zero.
but according to the calculation at x=1.9, f(x)≈-4.7.
wait, but that suggests that the function might cross zero somewhere between x=1.9 and x=2?
wait, but we know at x=2 it's exactly zero.
wait, but maybe due to precision?
wait, perhaps my approximations are a bit off.
let me check with x=2.
at x=2, 9^2=81, 10^2=100.
so 81 +19=100, which is exactly 100.
so f(2)=0.
but when x is less than 2, like at x=1, f(x)=18, at x=1.5 it's ~14, at x=1.75?
let me check.
x=1.75: 9^1.75.
let's compute ln(9^1.75)=1.75*ln9≈1.75*2.197≈3.845.
so exp(3.845)≈46.7.
10^1.75: ln(10^1.75)=1.75*ln10≈1.75*2.302≈4.028.
exp(4.028)≈55.7.
thus, f(1.75)=46.7 +19 -55.7≈10.0.
still positive.
at x=1.8: 9^1.8: ln(9^1.8)=1.8*ln9≈1.8*2.197≈3.955.
exp(3.955)=52.3.
10^1.8= exp(1.8*ln10)=exp(1.8*2.302)=exp(4.144)=66.0.
so f(1.8)=52.3 +19 -66.0≈5.3.
still positive.
at x=1.9: 9^1.9≈ as before, 9^1.9≈64.0.
10^1.9≈87.7.
so f(1.9)=64.0 +19 -87.7≈-14.7.
wait, so f(1.8)=5.3 and f(1.9)= -14.7.
so by the intermediate value theorem, since f is continuous, there must be a root between x=1.8 and x=1.9 where f(x)=0.
but we already know that f(2)=0.
so this suggests that the function crosses zero again between x=1.8 and x=1.9?
wait, but that contradicts with the idea that x=2 is the only solution.
wait, but that can't be.
wait, perhaps my calculation is wrong.
wait, if x=1.8 gives f(x)=5.3, x=1.9 gives f(x)=-4.7, then the function crosses zero between x=1.8 and x=1.9.
but we know f(2)=0, so that would imply there are two roots.
but that's impossible because the function is convex or concave?
let's check the second derivative.
let me compute the first and second derivatives of f(x) = 9^x + 19 -10^x.
first derivative f’(x) = 9^x ln9 -10^x ln10.
second derivative f''(x) = 9^x (ln9)^2 -10^x (ln10)^2.
at x=2, f''(2) = 81*(ln9)^2 - 100*(ln10)^2 ≈ 81*(2.197)^2 -100*(2.302)^2 ≈ 81*4.827 -100*5.300 ≈ 390.4 -530 ≈ -139.6.
so the second derivative is negative at x=2, meaning the function is concave down at that point.
wait, but if the function is concave down at x=2, and if there's another root near x=1.85, then the function would need to turn around.
wait, but according to the calculations, f(1.8)=5.3, f(1.9)≈-4.7.
so the function crosses zero between x=1.8 and x=1.9.
but wait, at x=2, f(x)=0 again.
so that would mean the function crosses zero three times?
but that can't be for a concave function.
wait, perhaps my calculations are wrong.
wait, let's check f(1.9).
wait, 9^1.9: 9^1=9, 9^2=81, so 9^1.9 is just below 81.
let me compute 9^1.9 more accurately.
take logarithms: ln(9^1.9)=1.9*ln9≈1.9*2.197≈4.174.
so exp(4.174)≈64.0.
then 10^1.9: 10^1=10, 10^2=100.
1.9 is close to 2.
ln(10^1.9)=1.9*ln10≈1.9*2.302≈4.375.
exp(4.375)= 4.375 is ln(87.7), so 10^1.9≈87.7.
so f(1.9)=64.0 +19 -87.7≈93.0 -87.7≈5.3.
wait, so f(1.9)=approx5.3?
but that contradicts my previous quick calculation.
wait, let's compute 9^1.9 first.
wait, 9^1.9 = 9^(1 +0.9)=9*9^0.9.
9^0.9=exp(0.9 ln9)=exp(0.9*2.197)=exp(1.977)≈7.22.
so 9*7.22≈65.0.
then 10^1.9=10^(1 +0.9)=10*10^0.9.
10^0.9≈exp(0.9*2.302)=exp(2.072)=7.91.
so 10*7.91≈79.1.
thus, f(1.9)=65.0 +19 -79.1≈84.0 -79.1≈4.9.
hmm, so f(1.9)=≈4.9, still positive.
wait, so my previous calculation was a bit off due to estimation.
at x=2, f(x)=0.
wait, at x=2.1: let's check.
9^2.1: 9^(2 +0.1)=9^2*9^0.1=81*9^0.1.
9^0.1≈exp(0.1*2.197)=exp(0.2197)=1.244.
so 81*1.244≈100.7.
10^2.1=10^2*10^0.1=100*10^0.1≈100*1.2589≈125.89.
thus, f(2.1)=100.7 +19 -125.89≈119.7 -125.89≈-6.19.
so f(2.1)=≈-6.19.
so between x=2.0 and x=2.1, f(x) goes from 0 to -6.19.
but if at x=2, f(x)=0, and nearby points are positive at lower x and negative at higher x.
wait, but then between x=1.9 and x=2.0, f(x) goes from ≈4.9 to 0.
so the function approaches zero from positive side as x increases to 2, then beyond x=2, it's negative.
so the function crosses zero only once at x=2.
but earlier when x=1.9, f(x)≈4.9, which is positive.
wait, but as x increases from 1.9 to 2.0, f(x) decreases from 4.9 to 0.
so the only root is at x=2.
wait, but that means when x=1.9, the function is positive, and at x=2.0, it's zero.
so how does it get from 4.9 to 0?
is the function decreasing there.
so the function is smooth, so between x=1.9 and x=2.0, f(x) decreases from 4.9 to 0.
thus, x=2 is the only solution.
but wait, if that's the case, then why when i checked x=1.9, x=2.0 gave f(x)=0, but x=2.1 is already -6.19.
wait, but maybe there is only one real solution at x=2.
then why when i checked x=1.9, f(x) is positive, and at x=2.0 it's zero, x=2.1 it's negative.
so the function crosses zero only once at x=2.
therefore, x=2 is the only real solution.
so maybe there was a miscalculation earlier when i thought there might be another root.
but that was due to incorrect approximations.
so in reality, the function only crosses zero once at x=2.
therefore, the only solution is x=2.
alternatively, let's think about the behavior of the function 9^x + 19 - 10^x.
as x increases, the 10^x term grows faster than the 9^x term, right?
because 10^x grows faster than 9^x.
so after x=2, the 10^x term dominates, making the whole expression negative.
for x less than 2, the 9^x term is not dominant enough, but the combination 9^x +19 can exceed 10^x until a certain point.
but we saw at x=2, they balance, and for x less than 2, 9^x +19 is greater, and for x greater than 2, 10^x is greater.
wait, but when x is less than 2, at x=1, 9^1 +19=28, 10^1=10, so 28>10.
at x=2, 9^2 +19=100, 10^2=100, equal.
for x>2, 10^x grows faster.
so the function 9^x +19 -10^x is positive for x<2, zero at x=2, and negative for x>2.
therefore, x=2 is the only solution.
therefore, the equation has only one solution, x=2.
but just to confirm, let's check another value for x less than 2, maybe x=1.5.
at x=1.5, 9^1.5=27, as before, plus 19=46, 10^1.5≈31.62, so 46>31.62.
hence, f(x)=46 -31.62≈14.38>0.
so indeed, positive.
therefore, the function is positive for x<2, zero at x=2, and negative for x>2.
thus, x=2 is the only solution.
therefore, the answer is x=2.
wait, but let me check once more.
suppose someone claims there might be a solution where x is negative.
let's check.
let x=-1.
then 3^(2x)=3^(-2)=1/9, and 10^x=10^(-1)=1/10.
so left side: 1/9 +19≈20.111, right side: 0.1.
so 20.111 vs 0.1.
not equal.
for x=-2, left side: 3^(-4) +19≈(1/81) +19≈19.012, right side: 10^(-2)=0.01.
so 19.012 vs 0.01.
not equal.
as x approaches negative infinity, 3^(2x) approaches 0, 10^x approaches 0, so left side approaches 0 +19=19, right side approaches 0.
so equation becomes 19=0, which is never true.
therefore, no solution for x negative.
therefore, x=2 is the only solution.
alternatively, another approach.
let me rearrange the original equation: 9^x +19=10^x.
let me write this as 10^x -9^x=19.
let me consider the function g(x)=10^x -9^x.
we need to find x such that g(x)=19.
compute g(2)=100 -81=19.
so that works.
now, let's check the monotonicity of g(x).
g’(x)=10^x ln10 -9^x ln9.
at x=2, g’(2)=100 ln10 -81 ln9≈100*2.3026 -81*2.197≈230.26 -177.75≈52.51>0.
wait, earlier when i considered f(x)=9^x +19 -10^x, f’(2) was negative.
but here, g(x) is 10^x -9^x, so g’(x)=10^x ln10 -9^x ln9.
let's see.
at x=2, g’(2)=100*ln10 -81*ln9≈100*2.3026 -81*2.197≈230.26 -177.95≈52.31>0.
wait, so if g(x)=10^x -9^x, then g(x)=19.
at x=2, g(2)=19.
and g’(x) is positive for x>2?
let me check.
for x>2, 10^x ln10 grows faster than 9^x ln9, so g’(x) would be positive?
wait, but actually, 10^x grows faster than 9^x, so their difference derivative g’(x) would be positive?
wait, if g’(x)=10^x ln10 -9^x ln9, then as x increases, 10^x ln10 increases faster than 9^x ln9, because the base 10 is larger.
so g’(x) would be increasing?
wait, so g’(x) is increasing.
therefore, since at x=2, g’(2)≈52.31>0, and since g’(x) is increasing for x>2, g’(x) will be positive for all x>2.
therefore, g(x) is increasing for x>2.
but wait, if x=2 is where g(x)=19, and if g(x) is increasing for x>2, then there can be no solution for x>2, since g(x) would be increasing above 19.
however, when i checked x=3, g(3)=1000 -729=271>19.
so that's consistent.
but then, how does g(x) behave for x<2?
let me check g(1)=10 -9=1.
so from x=1 to x=2, g(x) increases from 1 to 19.
therefore, since g(x) is increasing for x>2 and for x<2?
wait, but wait, let's compute g’(x) at x=1: 10^1 ln10 -9^1 ln9≈10*2.3026 -9*2.197≈23.026 -19.773≈3.253>0.
so at x=1, g’(x) is positive.
similarly, at x=0, g’(0)=1*ln10 -1*ln9≈0.105>0.
therefore, g’(x) is positive for all x.
therefore, g(x) is strictly increasing.
therefore, the equation g(x)=19 has exactly one solution, which is at x=2.
therefore, the only solution is x=2.
that makes sense.
so even though i initially thought there might be another root due to a miscalculation, in reality, since g(x)=10^x -9^x is strictly increasing, the equation g(x)=19 has only one solution.
therefore, the answer is x=2.
**final answer**
\boxed{2}
</think>

answer: to solve the equation \(3^{2x} + 19 = 10^x\) for \(x\), we start by simplifying the left-hand side. recognizing that \(3^{2x} = (3^2)^x = 9^x\), the equation becomes:

\[9^x + 19 = 10^x\]

next, we rearrange the equation to isolate the exponential terms:

\[10^x - 9^x = 19\]

we define the function \(g(x) = 10^x - 9^x\) and need to find the value of \(x\) for which \(g(x) = 19\). 

to analyze the behavior of \(g(x)\), we compute its derivative:

\[g'(x) = 10^x \ln 10 - 9^x \ln 9\]

we observe that both \(10^x \ln 10\) and \(-9^x \ln 9\) are increasing functions because the exponential functions \(10^x\) and \(9^x\) are increasing, and their derivatives maintain the same sign. therefore, \(g'(x)\) is positive for all \(x\), indicating that \(g(x)\) is strictly increasing.

given that \(g(x)\) is strictly increasing, there can be at most one solution to the equation \(g(x) = 19\). we test \(x = 2\):

\[g(2) = 10^2 - 9^2 = 100 - 81 = 19\]

thus, \(x = 2\) is indeed a solution. since \(g(x)\) is strictly increasing, this is the only solution.

therefore, the final answer is:

\[\boxed{2}\]
