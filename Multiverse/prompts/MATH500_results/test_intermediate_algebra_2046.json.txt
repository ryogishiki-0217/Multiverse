Okay, so I need to solve the equation 3^(2x) + 19 = 10^x for x. Hmm, let's see. Exponents... I remember that when dealing with exponential equations, it's sometimes helpful to take the logarithm of both sides, but here there are multiple exponential terms. Let me think.
First, let's rewrite the equation to see if we can simplify it somehow.
3^(2x) + 19 = 10^x.
Wait, 3^(2x) is the same as (3^2)^x, which is 9^x. So, the equation becomes 9^x + 19 = 10^x.
Ah! That's a useful simplification. So now we have 9^x + 19 = 10^x.
Let me write that again: 9^x + 19 = 10^x. Hmm. Let's rearrange the equation to get all terms with x on one side. Maybe subtract 9^x from both sides: 19 = 10^x - 9^x. Hmm, not sure that helps.
Alternatively, let's try to divide both sides by 10^x. So, 9^x / 10^x + 19 / 10^x = 1. That simplifies to (9/10)^x + 19 / 10^x = 1.
Hmm, (0.9)^x + 19 / 10^x = 1. Not sure if this is helpful.
Alternatively, maybe multiply both sides by 10^x? But that would give 9^x * 10^x + 19 * 10^x = (10^x)^2. Not sure that's better.
Let's think in parallel.

1: Alternatively, maybe take the natural logarithm of both sides? Let's try that.
Original equation: 9^x + 19 = 10^x.
Take ln of both sides: ln(9^x + 19) = ln(10^x).
Hmm, the left side is ln(9^x + 19), which doesn't simplify nicely because the logarithm of a sum isn't the sum of logarithms. So that might not be helpful.
Alternatively, maybe bring all terms to one side: 10^x - 9^x = 19.
Hmm, this is similar to an exponential equation where the difference between two exponentials equals a constant. I wonder if there's a substitution or a way to factor this.
Alternatively, perhaps this equation can't be solved algebraically and needs a numerical solution. Let me check if there's an obvious x that satisfies the equation.
</Path>
<Path>
2: Maybe I can use substitution or let y = 10^x? Wait, let me try that. Let y = 10^x. Then, 9^x is (9/10 * 10)^x = (9/10)^x * 10^x, so 9^x = (9/10)^x * y. But then the equation becomes (9/10)^x * y + 19 = y. So, y*((9/10)^x) + 19 = y. Then, y*((9/10)^x) - y = -19. Factor y: y( (9/10)^x - 1 ) = -19. So, y = -19 / ( (9/10)^x - 1 ). But since y = 10^x, this gives 10^x = -19 / ( (9/10)^x - 1 ). Hmm, this seems a bit circular. Maybe not helpful.
Alternatively, perhaps use natural logarithms. Take the natural log of both sides of the original equation after rearranging? Let's see. The equation is 9^x + 19 = 10^x. Maybe bring all terms to one side: 10^x - 9^x - 19 = 0. Hmm, I'm not sure how to apply logarithms here because of the multiple terms.
Alternatively, is there a way to approximate the solution numerically? Let's think.
Perhaps try some integer values for x and see if we can find a solution or at least bracket the solution between two values.

<Path>
2.3: Wait, x=3: left side is 729 + 19 = 748, right side is 1000. Not equal.
</Path>
<Path>
2.4: Wait, maybe check if there are other solutions. Since 10^x grows exponentially, as does 9^x, but 10^x grows faster than 9^x. So the difference 10^x - 9^x -19 is zero at x=2. For x less than 2, 10^x is smaller than 9^x +19. For x greater than 2, 10^x grows faster than 9^x, so the difference would be positive. But since both 10^x and 9^x are increasing functions, the difference can have at most one real root. Wait, but we found x=2, and since 10^x -9^x is convex (the second derivative is positive), the function f(x) = 10^x -9^x -19 is convex, which means it can cross zero at most twice. But we found x=2 as a solution, let's check x=1 and x=3. Wait, at x=1, f(x)=10 -9 -19= -18. At x=3, 1000 -729 -19=252. So the function goes from negative at x=1 to positive at x=3. Since it's convex, only one real root. So x=2 is the only real solution.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
Testing x=3 gives 748 = 1000, which is false. Testing x=0 gives 20 = 1, which is false. Testing x=-1 gives approximately 2.22 = 0.1, which is false. Testing x=-2 gives approximately 19.01 = 0.01, which is false. The function f(x) = 10^x - 9^x - 19 is convex, so x=2 is the only real solution.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Therefore, x=2 is the only real solution. Let me verify that again. At x=2, 9^2 +19 =81+19=100, which is 10^2. So yes, that works. And since the function f(x) =10^x -9^x -19 is convex and increasing for x > 2 (since 10^x grows faster than 9^x), there can't be another real solution. Alternatively, for x approaching negative infinity, both 10^x and 9^x approach 0, so f(x) approaches -19, which is negative. Therefore, the function crosses zero exactly once. Therefore, x=2 is the only solution.
But wait, just to make sure, is there another solution when x is negative? Let's check. Let's think in parallel.

2.1: Take x = -1: left side is 9^(-1) +19≈0.111 +19≈19.111, right side is 10^(-1)=0.1. Not equal.
</Path>
<Path>
2.2: x=-2: 1/81 +19 = approx 19.012, 10^(-2)=0.01. 19.012 ≠0.01. No.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
Testing x=-1 gives approximately 19.111 = 0.1, which is false. Testing x=-2 gives approximately 19.012 = 0.01, which is false. There are no solutions for x < 0.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So no solution for negative x. Therefore, x=2 is the only real solution.
Therefore, the final answer is 2.
**Final Answer** 
\boxed{2}
</Think>

Answer: To solve the equation \(3^{2x} + 19 = 10^x\) for \(x\), we start by simplifying the term \(3^{2x}\) which can be rewritten as \((3^2)^x = 9^x\). This transforms the equation into:

\[9^x + 19 = 10^x\]

Next, we rearrange the equation to isolate the terms involving \(x\):

\[10^x - 9^x = 19\]

We then test integer values for \(x\) to find a solution. Testing \(x = 2\):

\[10^2 - 9^2 = 100 - 81 = 19\]

This satisfies the equation. To confirm that this is the only real solution, we analyze the function \(f(x) = 10^x - 9^x - 19\). Since both \(10^x\) and \(9^x\) are exponential functions with base greater than 1, they are convex and increasing. The function \(f(x)\) is also convex, meaning it can have at most two real roots. Given that \(f(x)\) approaches \(-19\) as \(x\) approaches negative infinity and approaches infinity as \(x\) approaches positive infinity, and considering that \(x = 2\) is a root where the function crosses zero, we conclude that \(x = 2\) is the only real solution.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[\boxed{2}\]<Path>
3: Alternatively, maybe there's a way to approximate the solution numerically. Let's consider that. Let me think about using numerical methods like Newton-Raphson. But first, let's try to see if there is an integer solution.
Let's check x=1: 9^1 + 19 = 28, 10^1=10. 28 ≠10. Nope.
x=2: 81 +19=100, 10^2=100. Oh! Wait, 100=100. So x=2 is a solution. Wait, that's simple. How did I not see that before.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
Testing x=-1 gives approximately 19.111 = 0.1, which is false. Testing x=-2 gives approximately 19.012 = 0.01, which is false. The function f(x) = 10^x - 9^x - 19 is convex, so x=2 is the only real solution.

But since y = 10^x, this gives 10^x = -19 / ( (9/10)^x - 1 ). Hmm, this seems a bit circular. Maybe not helpful.
