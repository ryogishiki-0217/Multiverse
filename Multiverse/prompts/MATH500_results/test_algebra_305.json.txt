Okay, so I need to solve this problem where I have the function f(x) = (2x)/(x2 - 5x - 14), and I need to find the sum of the vertical asymptotes and the horizontal asymptote. The question asks for a + b + c, where a and b are the vertical asymptotes and c is the horizontal asymptote.
Alright, let's start with vertical asymptotes.
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero (as long as the numerator isn't also zero there, which would create a hole instead).
So, first, I need to find the roots of the denominator x2 - 5x - 14.
Let me try to factor that quadratic.
The equation is x2 - 5x - 14.
I need two numbers that multiply to -14 and add up to -5.
Let's see: factors of -14 could be 2 and -7, because 2 times -7 is -14, and 2 plus (-7) is -5.
Yes, that works.
So, the quadratic factors as (x + 2)(x - 7).
Wait, let me check: (x + 2)(x - 7) = x2 -7x +2x -14 = x2 -5x -14. Yep, that's right.
So the denominator factors into (x + 2)(x - 7).
Therefore, the denominator is zero when x = -2 or x = 7.
So the vertical asymptotes are at x = -2 and x = 7.
Therefore, a and b are -2 and 7.
Now, horizontal asymptotes.
For horizontal asymptotes, I need to consider the behavior of the function as x approaches infinity.
For rational functions, the horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the numerator and denominator.
Here, the numerator is 2x, which is degree 1, and the denominator is x2 -5x -14, which is degree 2.
Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0.
Wait, is that right?
If the degree of the numerator is less than the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is y=0.
If equal, it's y = leading coefficient numerator / leading coefficient denominator.
If greater, there is no horizontal asymptote (unless it's an oblique asymptote, but that's different).
Here, numerator degree is 1, denominator degree is 2.
Since 1 < 2, the horizontal asymptote is y=0.
So c = 0.
Therefore, a = -2, b =7, c=0.
So a + b + c = -2 +7 +0 = 5.
Wait, but let me verify this step by step to be sure.
First, vertical asymptotes: denominator factors correctly to (x +2)(x -7), so roots at x = -2 and 7.
So vertical asymptotes at those x-values because the numerator doesn't cancel them out.
The numerator is 2x, which is not zero at x = -2 or 7.
So yes, asymptotes there.
For horizontal asymptote, as x approaches infinity, the highest degree terms in the numerator and denominator dominate.
So, f(x) ≈ (2x)/(x2) = 2/x.
As x approaches infinity, 2/x approaches 0.
Therefore, y=0 is the horizontal asymptote.
So c = 0.
Therefore, a + b + c = (-2) + 7 + 0 = 5.
That seems correct.
But let me just check one more time to make sure I didn't make a mistake.
Vertical asymptotes: quadratic denominator factored correctly?
x2 -5x -14:  (x +2)(x -7) => x2 -7x +2x -14 = x2 -5x -14. Yes.
So roots at x = -2 and x =7, so vertical asymptotes at these points.
Horizontal asymptote: since the denominator's degree is higher, yes, y=0.
So adding up a + b + c: a and b are -2 and 7 (so together -2 +7) and c is 0, so total 5.
Alright, seems good.
**Final Answer**
\boxed{5}

Answer: To solve the problem, we need to find the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \) and then compute the sum \( a + b + c \).

**Vertical Asymptotes:**
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero (as long as the numerator isn't also zero there). We factor the denominator:
\[
x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x + 2)(x - 7)
\]
Setting each factor equal to zero gives the vertical asymptotes:
\[
x + 2 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = -2
\]
\[
x - 7 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 7
\]
Thus, the vertical asymptotes are at \( x = -2 \) and \( x = 7 \), so \( a = -2 \) and \( b = 7 \).

**Horizontal Asymptote:**
For horizontal asymptotes, we consider the behavior as \( x \) approaches infinity. The degree of the numerator (1) is less than the degree of the denominator (2). Therefore, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \), so \( c = 0 \).

**Summing the Values:**
Adding the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
\[
a + b + c = -2 + 7 + 0 = 5
\]

The final answer is \(\boxed{5}\).

answer: to solve the problem, we need to find the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \) and then compute the sum \( a + b + c \).

**vertical asymptotes:**
vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero (as long as the numerator isn't also zero there). we factor the denominator:
\[
x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x + 2)(x - 7)
\]
setting each factor equal to zero gives the vertical asymptotes:
\[
x + 2 = 0 \quad \rightarrow \quad x = -2
\]
\[
x - 7 = 0 \quad \rightarrow \quad x = 7
\]
thus, the vertical asymptotes are at \( x = -2 \) and \( x = 7 \), so \( a = -2 \) and \( b = 7 \).

**horizontal asymptote:**
for horizontal asymptotes, we consider the behavior as \( x \) approaches infinity. the degree of the numerator (1) is less than the degree of the denominator (2). therefore, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \), so \( c = 0 \).

**summing the values:**
adding the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
\[
a + b + c = -2 + 7 + 0 = 5
\]

the final answer is \(\boxed{5}\)
