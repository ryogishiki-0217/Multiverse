Okay, so I have this problem here about vectors. Let me read it again: We have vectors a and b. The angle between a and b is 29 degrees, and the angle between b and (a - b) is 84 degrees. I need to find the angle between a and (a - b). Hmm, okay.
First, let me visualize this. Imagine vectors a and b in space somewhere, with an angle of 29 degrees between them. Then, the vector (a - b) is formed by subtracting b from a. Now, the angle between b and (a - b) is 84 degrees. They want to know the angle between a and (a - b).
Let me recall some vector properties. The angle between two vectors can be found using the dot product formula: cosθ = (a · b) / (|a||b|). Maybe I can set up equations based on that.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: Establish the relationship between the angle between vectors a and b and their dot product.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: Establish the relationship between the angle between vectors b and (a - b) and their dot product.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The dot product of vectors a and b is expressed as a · b = |a||b|cos(29°), which defines the relationship based on the given angle between them.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The angle between vector b and the vector (a - b) is 84 degrees, which implies that their dot product, b · (a - b), can be expressed as |b||a - b|cos(84°).
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The dot product a · b is equivalent to |a||b|cos(29°), and the dot product b · (a - b) is equivalent to |b||a - b|cos(84°).
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Also, note that (a - b) is a vector. Let me think if there's a relationship between these angles. Maybe drawing a diagram would help. If I draw vector a, vector b with a 29-degree angle between them. Then, vector (a - b) would be the diagonal of the parallelogram formed by a and -b, right? Hmm, not exactly. When you do a - b, it's like adding a and (-b), so the angle between a and -b would be 180 - 29 = 151 degrees? Wait, no. Actually, the angle between a and b is 29°, so the angle between a and (-b) would be 180 - 29 = 151°, but actually, direction matters. But maybe that's complicating.
Alternatively, use the law of cosines in the triangle formed by a, b, and a - b. Wait, if you imagine vectors starting from the same point, then a - b can be seen as the vector from the tip of b to the tip of a. Hmm, in that triangle, the sides are |a|, |b|, and |a - b|. The angle between a and b is 29°, so in the triangle, the angle between sides |a| and |b| would actually be 180 - 29 = 151 degrees if we're considering the angle at the vertex where a and -b meet. Wait, this is getting confusing.
Wait, let me clarify. When you have vector a and vector b, the angle between them is 29°. If we want to find the vector a - b, geometrically, you place the tail of -b at the tip of a, and then connect the tail of a to the tip of -b, which is the vector a - b. Alternatively, you can think of a - b as a + (-b), so you place vector -b (which is b in the opposite direction) at the tip of a, but no, actually, for a - b, you place the tail of both a and b at the same point, then the vector from the tip of b to the tip of a is a - b. So, the triangle formed has sides a, -b (which is equivalent to the vector b in the opposite direction), and a - b as the closing side.
Therefore, in the triangle with sides |a|, |b|, and |a - b|, the angle opposite to |a - b| would be the angle between a and b, which is 29°? Wait, no. Wait, in the triangle made by a, b, and a - b, the angle between a and -b is 29°, so the angle in the triangle at the vertex where a and -b meet would be 180° - 29° = 151°, right? Because if two vectors a and b form an angle of 29°, then a and -b form an angle of 180° - 29° = 151°. Therefore, in the triangle, the angle between a and b (when composing a - b) is actually 151°? Wait, I'm getting confused here.
Wait, maybe better to use coordinates. Let me set up coordinate systems such that vectors a and b are in a plane, with a along the x-axis, and b at an angle of 29° from the x-axis. Then, compute all necessary quantities.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: The coordinates of vector a, assuming it is aligned with the x-axis.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: The coordinates of vector b, assuming it forms a 29° angle with the x-axis.

</Goal>
<Path>
1: Vector a is assumed to lie along the x-axis. Its coordinates are given by (|a|, 0).
</Path>
<Path>
2: Vector b, forming a 29° angle with the x-axis, is represented in coordinates as (|b|cos(29°), |b|sin(29°)).
</Path>
<Conclusion>
Vector a is represented as (|a|, 0), and vector b is represented as (|b|cos(29°), |b|sin(29°)), based on the given angle between them.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Then, vector (a - b) would have coordinates (|a| - |b|cos(29°), 0 - |b|sin(29°)). So, components are (|a| - |b|cos(29°), - |b|sin(29°)). Now, we need the angle between b and (a - b). Vector b is at 29°, and vector (a - b) is in the direction of (|a| - |b|cos(29°), - |b|sin(29°)), which is in the fourth quadrant. The angle between them is given as 84°. Wait, but in this coordinate system, vector b is at 29° above the x-axis, and vector (a - b) is pointing in the direction (|a| - |b|cos(29°), - |b|sin(29°)), which is below the x-axis. The angle between vector b (29° above x-axis) and vector (a - b) (some angle below x-axis) is 84°. So the angle between these two vectors should be the difference between their angles. Let me formalize this.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: The angle θ between vector a and the vector (a - b) is to be determined.

1: The angle θ between vector a and the vector (a - b) is to be found. Vector a is aligned along the positive x-axis, and vector (a - b) has a direction defined by its components (|a| - |b|cos(29°), - |b|sin(29°)). The angle θ is the angle between the positive x-axis and the direction of vector (a - b).
</Path>
<Path>
2: The dot product of vectors b and (a - b) is expressed as |b||a - b|cos(84°).
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The angle θ between vector a and the vector (a - b) is defined as the angle from the positive x-axis to the direction of (a - b), and the dot product between vectors b and (a - b) is given by |b||a - b|cos(84°).
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
But we can also compute the dot product as:
b · (a - b) = |b||a - b|cos(84°)
But also, expanding the dot product:
b · (a - b) = b · a - b · b = |a||b|cos(29°) - |b|^2
Therefore:
|a||b|cos(29°) - |b|^2 = |b||a - b|cos(84°)
Similarly, we can write |a - b| as sqrt(|a|^2 + |b|^2 - 2|a||b|cos(180° - 151°)) Wait, no. Wait, in the triangle with sides |a|, |b|, |a - b|, the angle between a and b is 29°, so the magnitude of (a - b) would be sqrt(|a|^2 + |b|^2 - 2|a||b|cos(29°)). Wait, is that correct?
Wait, the formula for |a - b|^2 = |a|^2 + |b|^2 - 2|a||b|cosθ, where θ is the angle between a and b. Wait, yes! So here, since the angle between a and b is 29°, then |a - b| = sqrt(|a|^2 + |b|^2 - 2|a||b|cos(29°)). So, substitute that into the equation:
|a||b|cos(29°) - |b|^2 = |b| * sqrt(|a|^2 + |b|^2 - 2|a||b|cos(29°)) * cos(84°)
Hmm. Let me note this as equation (1):
|a||b|cos(29°) - |b|^2 = |b| * sqrt(|a|^2 + |b|^2 - 2|a||b|cos(29°)) * cos(84°)
Divide both sides by |b| (assuming |b| ≠ 0):
|a|cos(29°) - |b| = sqrt(|a|^2 + |b|^2 - 2|a||b|cos(29°)) * cos(84°)
Hmm. Let me denote |a| as x and |b| as y for simplicity. So:
x cos(29°) - y = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 - 2 x y cos(29°)) * cos(84°)
That's one equation. But we need another equation to relate x and y. Because with two variables, we need two equations. But in the problem, is there another relation given? Hmm. The problem gives two angles but no magnitudes, so we need to find another equation.
Wait, maybe we can write another equation based on the angle between a and (a - b). Let's see. Let's call the angle between a and (a - b) as θ, which is what we need to find. Then, the dot product of a and (a - b) is |a||a - b|cosθ. But also, a · (a - b) = a · a - a · b = |a|^2 - |a||b|cos(29°). Therefore:
|a|^2 - |a||b|cos(29°) = |a||a - b|cosθ
Similarly, substituting |a - b| as sqrt(|a|^2 + |b|^2 - 2|a||b|cos(29°)), we have:
sqrt(|a|^2 + |b|^2 - 2|a||b|cos(29°)) = |a - b|
Therefore:
|a|^2 - |a||b|cos(29°) = |a| * sqrt(|a|^2 + |b|^2 - 2|a||b|cos(29°)) * cosθ
But we can write this in terms of x and y as before, where x = |a|, y = |b|:
x^2 - x y cos(29°) = x * sqrt(x^2 + y^2 - 2 x y cos(29°)) * cosθ
Divide both sides by x:
x - y cos(29°) = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 - 2 x y cos(29°)) * cosθ
So now, we have two equations:
1. x cos(29°) - y = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 - 2 x y cos(29°)) * cos(84°)
2. x - y cos(29°) = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 - 2 x y cos(29°)) * cosθ
So, if we can solve equation 1 for the ratio x/y, then substitute into equation 2 to find cosθ.
Alternatively, let me square both sides of equation 1 to eliminate the square root. Let me denote cos(29°) as c1, cos(84°) as c2, to simplify notation.
Let's think in parallel.

1: Equation 1 is expressed using the substitutions c1 = cos(29°) and c2 = cos(84°) as x*c1 - y = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 - 2*x*y*c1) * c2. Squaring both sides of this equation yields (x*c1 - y)^2 = (x^2 + y^2 - 2*x*y*c1) * c2^2.
</Path>
<Path>
2: Equation 2, (x - y c1) = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 - 2 x y c1) * cosθ, is simplified to (x - y c1) / sqrt(x^2 + y^2 - 2 x y c1) = cosθ.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
Equation 1 is transformed into (x*c1 - y)^2 = (x^2 + y^2 - 2*x*y*c1) * c2^2, and Equation 2 is simplified to (x - y c1) / sqrt(x^2 + y^2 - 2 x y c1) = cosθ, using the specified substitutions for c1 and c2.

Now, going back to equation 1 squared:

The left-hand side (LHS) of the equation is x^2 c1^2 - 2 x y c1 + y^2, and the right-hand side (RHS) of the equation is (x^2 + y^2 - 2 x y c1) c2^2.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Bring all terms to left:
x^2 c1^2 - 2 x y c1 + y^2 - (x^2 + y^2 - 2 x y c1) c2^2 = 0
Expand the last term:
- x^2 c2^2 - y^2 c2^2 + 2 x y c1 c2^2
So combining terms:
x^2 (c1^2 - c2^2) + y^2 (1 - c2^2) - 2 x y c1 (1 - c2^2) = 0
Wait, wait:
Wait, let's check term by term:
1. x^2 term: c1^2 - c2^2
2. y^2 term: 1 - c2^2
3. xy term: -2 x y c1 + 2 x y c1 c2^2 = -2 x y c1 (1 - c2^2)
Therefore, equation becomes:
x^2 (c1^2 - c2^2) + y^2 (1 - c2^2) - 2 x y c1 (1 - c2^2) = 0
Factor out (1 - c2^2) from the last two terms:
x^2 (c1^2 - c2^2) + (1 - c2^2)(y^2 - 2 x y c1) = 0
Hmm. Let me compute c1 and c2:
cos(29°) ≈ 0.8746
cos(84°) ≈ 0.1045
So c1 ≈ 0.8746, c2 ≈ 0.1045
Compute c1^2 - c2^2 ≈ (0.8746)^2 - (0.1045)^2 ≈ 0.7644 - 0.0109 ≈ 0.7535
1 - c2^2 ≈ 1 - 0.0109 ≈ 0.9891
So approximately, equation becomes:
0.7535 x^2 + 0.9891 (y^2 - 2 * 0.8746 x y) ≈ 0
But maybe it's better to keep it in exact terms. Let's note that 1 - cos^2(84°) = sin^2(84°), since cos(84°) = sin(6°), so 1 - cos^2(84°) = sin^2(84°) ≈ (0.9945)^2 ≈ 0.9891, which matches. Similarly, cos^2(29°) - cos^2(84°) can be written as (cos(29°) - cos(84°))(cos(29°) + cos(84°)). Maybe.
Alternatively, let me divide both sides of the equation by y^2 to make it in terms of (x/y)^2 and (x/y):
x^2 (c1^2 - c2^2) + (1 - c2^2)(y^2 - 2 x y c1) = 0
Divide both sides by y^2:
(x^2 / y^2)(c1^2 - c2^2) + (1 - c2^2)(1 - 2 (x/y) c1) = 0
Let me set k = x/y = |a| / |b|. Then:
k2 (c12 - c22) + (1 - c22)(1 - 2 k c1) = 0
Expand this:
k2 (c12 - c22) + (1 - c22) - 2 k c1 (1 - c22) = 0
Rearranged:
(c12 - c22) k2 - 2 c1 (1 - c22) k + (1 - c22) = 0
This is a quadratic in terms of k. So:
A k2 + B k + C = 0, where
A = c12 - c22,
B = -2 c1 (1 - c22),
C = (1 - c22)
So, solving for k:
k = [2 c1 (1 - c22) ± sqrt(4 c12 (1 - c22)^2 - 4 (c12 - c22)(1 - c22))] / (2 (c12 - c22))
Simplify numerator:
= [2 c1 (1 - c22) ± 2 sqrt(c12 (1 - c22)^2 - (c12 - c22)(1 - c22))] / (2 (c12 - c22))
Cancel the 2 and factor sqrt:
= [c1 (1 - c22) ± sqrt((1 - c22)[c12 (1 - c22) - (c12 - c22)])] / (c12 - c22)
Simplify inside the sqrt:
c12(1 - c22) - c12 + c22 = c12(1 - c22 - 1) + c22 = c12(-c22) + c22 = - c12 c22 + c22 = c22(1 - c12)
Thus,
sqrt(c22(1 - c12)(1 - c22)) = c2 sqrt((1 - c12)(1 - c22))
Therefore, numerator:
= [c1(1 - c22) ± c2 sqrt((1 - c12)(1 - c22)))] / (c12 - c22)
Factor out sqrt(1 - c22):
= [sqrt(1 - c22) (c1 sqrt(1 - c22) ± c2 sqrt(1 - c12))] / (c12 - c22)
Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me compute numerical values.
Given c1 = cos(29°) ≈ 0.8746, c2 = cos(84°) ≈ 0.1045
Compute c12 ≈ 0.7647, c22 ≈ 0.0109
A = c12 - c22 ≈ 0.7647 - 0.0109 ≈ 0.7538
B = -2 c1 (1 - c22) ≈ -2*0.8746*(1 - 0.0109) ≈ -2*0.8746*0.9891 ≈ -1.730
C = 1 - c22 ≈ 0.9891
Discriminant D = B2 - 4AC ≈ (1.730)^2 - 4*0.7538*0.9891 ≈ 2.993 - 4*0.746 ≈ 2.993 - 2.984 ≈ 0.009
So sqrt(D) ≈ 0.0946
Thus,
k = [1.730 ± 0.0946]/(2*0.7538)
Denominator: 1.5076
Let's think in parallel.

1: The first root (k1) is calculated as (1.730 - 0.0946) / 1.5076, which approximates to 1.6354 / 1.5076, yielding approximately 1.085.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The second root k2 is calculated as (1.730 - 0.0946) / 1.5076, which simplifies to approximately 1.6354 / 1.5076, yielding approximately 1.084.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The quadratic equation for k yields two solutions: k1 ≈ 1.085 and k2 ≈ 1.084.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Wait, that can't be. Wait, discriminant D is approximately 0.009, so sqrt(D) ≈ 0.0946. Then:
Numerator for k1: 1.730 + 0.0946 ≈ 1.8246
k1 ≈ 1.8246 / 1.5076 ≈ 1.21
Numerator for k2: 1.730 - 0.0946 ≈ 1.6354
k2 ≈ 1.6354 / 1.5076 ≈ 1.085
So two possible solutions for k = |a|/|b|: approximately 1.21 or 1.085. Hmm. But which one is correct? We need to check which one satisfies the original equation.
Wait, but perhaps given that angles are given, maybe the ratio k is uniquely determined. Wait, but the quadratic equation gives two solutions. Hmm. Maybe both solutions are valid, depending on the direction of vectors? Wait, but vectors a and b have an angle of 29°, which is acute. The angle between b and (a - b) is 84°, also acute. So the geometry might restrict k to one solution. Alternatively, maybe one solution is inadmissible. Let's check.
But perhaps instead of getting numerical solutions, we can proceed symbolically. Let's recall that we need to find the angle θ between a and (a - b). From equation 2:
cosθ = (x - y c1) / sqrt(x2 + y2 - 2 x y c1)
But x = k y, so substituting x = k y,
cosθ = (k y - y c1)/sqrt( (k y)^2 + y^2 - 2 k y^2 c1 )
Factor y out:
= y (k - c1)/ [ y sqrt(k2 + 1 - 2 k c1 ) ]
= (k - c1)/sqrt(k2 + 1 - 2 k c1 )
Therefore, cosθ = (k - c1)/sqrt( (k - c1)^2 + (1 - c1^2) )
Wait, because k2 - 2 k c1 + 1 = (k - c1)^2 + (1 - c1^2)
Wait, k2 + 1 - 2 k c1 = (k2 - 2 k c1 + c12) + 1 - c12 = (k - c1)^2 + (1 - c12)
Therefore, sqrt(k2 + 1 - 2 k c1 ) = sqrt( (k - c1)^2 + (1 - c12) )
Therefore, cosθ = (k - c1)/sqrt( (k - c1)^2 + (1 - c12) )
Therefore, θ = arccos[ (k - c1)/sqrt( (k - c1)^2 + (1 - c12) ) ]
Alternatively, note that this expression is similar to the formula for the angle between two vectors. Let me see.
Wait, if we consider in 2D, vector a is (k, 0), vector b is (c1, sqrt(1 - c12)), since angle with a is 29°. Then, vector (a - b) is (k - c1, - sqrt(1 - c12)). Then, the angle between a and (a - b) is given by:
cosθ = [(k)(k - c1) + (0)(- sqrt(1 - c12))]/ ( |a| |a - b| )
= [k(k - c1)] / ( sqrt(k2) * sqrt( (k - c1)^2 + ( - sqrt(1 - c12) )^2 ) )
= [k(k - c1)] / ( k * sqrt( (k - c1)^2 + (1 - c12) ) )
= (k - c1)/sqrt( (k - c1)^2 + (1 - c12) )
Which matches the expression above. Therefore, indeed, θ = arccos[ (k - c1)/sqrt( (k - c1)^2 + (1 - c12) ) ]
Therefore, once we find k from equation 1, we can substitute into this formula. But from equation 1, we have two possible k values. So we need to check which k gives a real solution. But the problem is that the angles given in the problem might only allow one possible k. Alternatively, since in equation 1, after squaring, we might have introduced an extraneous solution. Therefore, we need to check which k satisfies the original equation.
Recall equation 1:
x c1 - y = sqrt(x2 + y2 - 2 x y c1 ) c2
With x = k y, this becomes:
(k y) c1 - y = sqrt( k2 y2 + y2 - 2 k y2 c1 ) c2
Factor y on the left:
y (k c1 - 1 ) = sqrt( y2 (k2 + 1 - 2 k c1 )) c2
= y sqrt( k2 + 1 - 2 k c1 ) c2
Assuming y ≠ 0, divide both sides by y:
(k c1 - 1 ) = sqrt( k2 + 1 - 2 k c1 ) c2
Therefore,
(k c1 - 1 ) / c2 = sqrt( k2 + 1 - 2 k c1 )
Now, square both sides:
(k c1 - 1 )2 / c22 = ( k2 + 1 - 2 k c1 )
Multiply both sides by c22:
(k c1 - 1 )2 = c22 ( k2 + 1 - 2 k c1 )
Which is the same equation we had before. Therefore, the quadratic in k gives two solutions, but we must check which one satisfies the original equation before squaring.
So compute for each k:
First, k ≈ 1.210
Left-hand side: (1.210 * 0.8746 - 1 ) / 0.1045 ≈ (1.059 - 1)/0.1045 ≈ 0.059/0.1045 ≈ 0.5646
Right-hand side: sqrt(1.2102 + 1 - 2*1.210*0.8746) ≈ sqrt(1.4641 +1 - 2.113) ≈ sqrt(0.3511) ≈ 0.5925
Compare: 0.5646 vs 0.5925. Not equal. So LHS ≈ 0.5646, RHS ≈ 0.5925. Therefore, k ≈1.210 does not satisfy the original equation.
Second, k ≈1.085
Left-hand side: (1.085*0.8746 -1 ) /0.1045 ≈ (0.948 -1)/0.1045 ≈ (-0.052)/0.1045 ≈ -0.4976
Right-hand side: sqrt(1.0852 +1 -2*1.085*0.8746) ≈ sqrt(1.177 +1 -1.853) ≈ sqrt(0.334) ≈ 0.578
But LHS is negative, RHS is positive. So they don't equal. Hmm, neither solution works? That's strange.
Wait, perhaps due to rounding errors. Let's use more precise numbers.
Let's compute c1 = cos(29°):
cos(29°) ≈ 0.8746197071
c2 = cos(84°) ≈ 0.1045284633
Compute k1 and k2 more accurately.
First, quadratic equation:
A = c12 - c22 ≈ 0.7647 - 0.0109 ≈ 0.7538
B = -2 c1 (1 - c22) ≈ -2*0.8746197071*(1 - 0.010902) ≈ -2*0.8746197071*0.989098 ≈ -1.729
C = 1 - c22 ≈ 0.9891
Discriminant D = B2 -4AC ≈ ( -1.729 )2 -4*(0.7538)*(0.9891) ≈ 2.990 - 3.003 ≈ -0.013
Wait, negative discriminant? That can't be. Wait, this is a problem. If the discriminant is negative, there are no real solutions. But we derived earlier that k must be a real number. Contradiction.
Wait, so perhaps my mistake was assuming that equation 1 would yield real solutions. But since the problem states that such vectors exist, there must be a real solution. Therefore, maybe the approximations are to blame. Let's compute D precisely.
Compute B:
B = -2 c1 (1 - c22) = -2 * cos(29°) * (1 - cos2(84°))
Compute 1 - cos2(84°) = sin2(84°)
So B = -2 cos(29°) sin2(84°)
Similarly, compute A = cos2(29°) - cos2(84°)
C = 1 - cos2(84°) = sin2(84°)
Therefore, discriminant D:
= [ -2 cos(29°) sin2(84°) ]2 - 4 [ cos2(29°) - cos2(84°) ] [ sin2(84°) ]
Expand:
= 4 cos2(29°) sin^4(84°) - 4 [ cos2(29°) sin2(84°) - cos2(84°) sin2(84°) ]
= 4 cos2(29°) sin^4(84°) - 4 cos2(29°) sin2(84°) + 4 cos2(84°) sin2(84°)
Factor:
= 4 cos2(84°) sin2(84°) + 4 cos2(29°) sin^4(84°) - 4 cos2(29°) sin2(84°)
Factor common terms:
= 4 cos2(29°) sin2(84°) [ sin2(84°) - 1 ] + 4 cos2(84°) sin2(84°)
But sin2(84°) -1 = -cos2(84°)
So:
= 4 cos2(84°) sin2(84°) - 4 cos2(29°) sin2(84°) cos2(84° )
= 4 cos2(84°) sin2(84°) [1 - cos2(29°)]
But 1 - cos2(29°) = sin2(29°)
Thus:
D = 4 cos2(84°) sin2(84°) sin2(29°)
Therefore, D is positive. So sqrt(D) = 2 cos(84°) sin(84°) sin(29°)
Thus, solutions for k:
k = [ 2 cos(29°) sin2(84° ) ± 2 cos(84°) sin(84° ) sin(29°

<think>
okay, so i have this problem here about vectors. let me read it again: we have vectors a and b. the angle between a and b is 29 degrees, and the angle between b and (a - b) is 84 degrees. i need to find the angle between a and (a - b). hmm, okay.
first, let me visualize this. imagine vectors a and b in space somewhere, with an angle of 29 degrees between them. then, the vector (a - b) is formed by subtracting b from a. now, the angle between b and (a - b) is 84 degrees. they want to know the angle between a and (a - b).
let me recall some vector properties. the angle between two vectors can be found using the dot product formula: cosθ = (a · b) / (|a||b|). maybe i can set up equations based on that.
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>
<goal>
<outline>
1: establish the relationship between the angle between vectors a and b and their dot product.
</outline>
<outline>
2: establish the relationship between the angle between vectors b and (a - b) and their dot product.
</outline>
</goal>
<path>
1: the dot product of vectors a and b is expressed as a · b = |a||b|cos(29°), which defines the relationship based on the given angle between them.
</path>
<path>
2: the angle between vector b and the vector (a - b) is 84 degrees, which implies that their dot product, b · (a - b), can be expressed as |b||a - b|cos(84°).
</path>
<conclusion>
the dot product a · b is equivalent to |a||b|cos(29°), and the dot product b · (a - b) is equivalent to |b||a - b|cos(84°).
</conclusion>
</parallel>
also, note that (a - b) is a vector. let me think if there's a relationship between these angles. maybe drawing a diagram would help. if i draw vector a, vector b with a 29-degree angle between them. then, vector (a - b) would be the diagonal of the parallelogram formed by a and -b, right? hmm, not exactly. when you do a - b, it's like adding a and (-b), so the angle between a and -b would be 180 - 29 = 151 degrees? wait, no. actually, the angle between a and b is 29°, so the angle between a and (-b) would be 180 - 29 = 151°, but actually, direction matters. but maybe that's complicating.
alternatively, use the law of cosines in the triangle formed by a, b, and a - b. wait, if you imagine vectors starting from the same point, then a - b can be seen as the vector from the tip of b to the tip of a. hmm, in that triangle, the sides are |a|, |b|, and |a - b|. the angle between a and b is 29°, so in the triangle, the angle between sides |a| and |b| would actually be 180 - 29 = 151 degrees if we're considering the angle at the vertex where a and -b meet. wait, this is getting confusing.
wait, let me clarify. when you have vector a and vector b, the angle between them is 29°. if we want to find the vector a - b, geometrically, you place the tail of -b at the tip of a, and then connect the tail of a to the tip of -b, which is the vector a - b. alternatively, you can think of a - b as a + (-b), so you place vector -b (which is b in the opposite direction) at the tip of a, but no, actually, for a - b, you place the tail of both a and b at the same point, then the vector from the tip of b to the tip of a is a - b. so, the triangle formed has sides a, -b (which is equivalent to the vector b in the opposite direction), and a - b as the closing side.
therefore, in the triangle with sides |a|, |b|, and |a - b|, the angle opposite to |a - b| would be the angle between a and b, which is 29°? wait, no. wait, in the triangle made by a, b, and a - b, the angle between a and -b is 29°, so the angle in the triangle at the vertex where a and -b meet would be 180° - 29° = 151°, right? because if two vectors a and b form an angle of 29°, then a and -b form an angle of 180° - 29° = 151°. therefore, in the triangle, the angle between a and b (when composing a - b) is actually 151°? wait, i'm getting confused here.
wait, maybe better to use coordinates. let me set up coordinate systems such that vectors a and b are in a plane, with a along the x-axis, and b at an angle of 29° from the x-axis. then, compute all necessary quantities.
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>
<goal>
<outline>
1: the coordinates of vector a, assuming it is aligned with the x-axis.
</outline>
<outline>
2: the coordinates of vector b, assuming it forms a 29° angle with the x-axis.
</outline>
</goal>
<path>
1: vector a is assumed to lie along the x-axis. its coordinates are given by (|a|, 0).
</path>
<path>
2: vector b, forming a 29° angle with the x-axis, is represented in coordinates as (|b|cos(29°), |b|sin(29°)).
</path>
<conclusion>
vector a is represented as (|a|, 0), and vector b is represented as (|b|cos(29°), |b|sin(29°)), based on the given angle between them.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
then, vector (a - b) would have coordinates (|a| - |b|cos(29°), 0 - |b|sin(29°)). so, components are (|a| - |b|cos(29°), - |b|sin(29°)). now, we need the angle between b and (a - b). vector b is at 29°, and vector (a - b) is in the direction of (|a| - |b|cos(29°), - |b|sin(29°)), which is in the fourth quadrant. the angle between them is given as 84°. wait, but in this coordinate system, vector b is at 29° above the x-axis, and vector (a - b) is pointing in the direction (|a| - |b|cos(29°), - |b|sin(29°)), which is below the x-axis. the angle between vector b (29° above x-axis) and vector (a - b) (some angle below x-axis) is 84°. so the angle between these two vectors should be the difference between their angles. let me formalize this.
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>
<goal>
<outline>
1: the angle θ between vector a and the vector (a - b) is to be determined.
</outline>
<outline>
2: the dot product expression relating the angle between vectors b and (a - b) to their magnitudes is to be established.
</outline>
</goal>
<path>
1: the angle θ between vector a and the vector (a - b) is to be found. vector a is aligned along the positive x-axis, and vector (a - b) has a direction defined by its components (|a| - |b|cos(29°), - |b|sin(29°)). the angle θ is the angle between the positive x-axis and the direction of vector (a - b).
</path>
<path>
2: the dot product of vectors b and (a - b) is expressed as |b||a - b|cos(84°).
</path>
<conclusion>
the angle θ between vector a and the vector (a - b) is defined as the angle from the positive x-axis to the direction of (a - b), and the dot product between vectors b and (a - b) is given by |b||a - b|cos(84°).
</conclusion>
</parallel>
but we can also compute the dot product as:
b · (a - b) = |b||a - b|cos(84°)
but also, expanding the dot product:
b · (a - b) = b · a - b · b = |a||b|cos(29°) - |b|^2
therefore:
|a||b|cos(29°) - |b|^2 = |b||a - b|cos(84°)
similarly, we can write |a - b| as sqrt(|a|^2 + |b|^2 - 2|a||b|cos(180° - 151°)) wait, no. wait, in the triangle with sides |a|, |b|, |a - b|, the angle between a and b is 29°, so the magnitude of (a - b) would be sqrt(|a|^2 + |b|^2 - 2|a||b|cos(29°)). wait, is that correct?
wait, the formula for |a - b|^2 = |a|^2 + |b|^2 - 2|a||b|cosθ, where θ is the angle between a and b. wait, yes! so here, since the angle between a and b is 29°, then |a - b| = sqrt(|a|^2 + |b|^2 - 2|a||b|cos(29°)). so, substitute that into the equation:
|a||b|cos(29°) - |b|^2 = |b| * sqrt(|a|^2 + |b|^2 - 2|a||b|cos(29°)) * cos(84°)
hmm. let me note this as equation (1):
|a||b|cos(29°) - |b|^2 = |b| * sqrt(|a|^2 + |b|^2 - 2|a||b|cos(29°)) * cos(84°)
divide both sides by |b| (assuming |b| ≠ 0):
|a|cos(29°) - |b| = sqrt(|a|^2 + |b|^2 - 2|a||b|cos(29°)) * cos(84°)
hmm. let me denote |a| as x and |b| as y for simplicity. so:
x cos(29°) - y = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 - 2 x y cos(29°)) * cos(84°)
that's one equation. but we need another equation to relate x and y. because with two variables, we need two equations. but in the problem, is there another relation given? hmm. the problem gives two angles but no magnitudes, so we need to find another equation.
wait, maybe we can write another equation based on the angle between a and (a - b). let's see. let's call the angle between a and (a - b) as θ, which is what we need to find. then, the dot product of a and (a - b) is |a||a - b|cosθ. but also, a · (a - b) = a · a - a · b = |a|^2 - |a||b|cos(29°). therefore:
|a|^2 - |a||b|cos(29°) = |a||a - b|cosθ
similarly, substituting |a - b| as sqrt(|a|^2 + |b|^2 - 2|a||b|cos(29°)), we have:
sqrt(|a|^2 + |b|^2 - 2|a||b|cos(29°)) = |a - b|
therefore:
|a|^2 - |a||b|cos(29°) = |a| * sqrt(|a|^2 + |b|^2 - 2|a||b|cos(29°)) * cosθ
but we can write this in terms of x and y as before, where x = |a|, y = |b|:
x^2 - x y cos(29°) = x * sqrt(x^2 + y^2 - 2 x y cos(29°)) * cosθ
divide both sides by x:
x - y cos(29°) = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 - 2 x y cos(29°)) * cosθ
so now, we have two equations:
1. x cos(29°) - y = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 - 2 x y cos(29°)) * cos(84°)
2. x - y cos(29°) = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 - 2 x y cos(29°)) * cosθ
so, if we can solve equation 1 for the ratio x/y, then substitute into equation 2 to find cosθ.
alternatively, let me square both sides of equation 1 to eliminate the square root. let me denote cos(29°) as c1, cos(84°) as c2, to simplify notation.
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>
<goal>
<outline>
1: the simplified form of equation 1 using the substitutions c1 = cos(29°) and c2 = cos(84°).
</outline>
<outline>
2: the simplified form of equation 2 using the substitution c1 = cos(29°).
</outline>
</goal>
<path>
1: equation 1 is expressed using the substitutions c1 = cos(29°) and c2 = cos(84°) as x*c1 - y = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 - 2*x*y*c1) * c2. squaring both sides of this equation yields (x*c1 - y)^2 = (x^2 + y^2 - 2*x*y*c1) * c2^2.
</path>
<path>
2: equation 2, (x - y c1) = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 - 2 x y c1) * cosθ, is simplified to (x - y c1) / sqrt(x^2 + y^2 - 2 x y c1) = cosθ.
</path>
<conclusion>
equation 1 is transformed into (x*c1 - y)^2 = (x^2 + y^2 - 2*x*y*c1) * c2^2, and equation 2 is simplified to (x - y c1) / sqrt(x^2 + y^2 - 2 x y c1) = cosθ, using the specified substitutions for c1 and c2.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
now, going back to equation 1 squared:
(x c1 - y)^2 = (x^2 + y^2 - 2 x y c1) c2^2
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>
<goal>
<outline>
1: the expanded form of the left-hand side (lhs) of the equation (x c1 - y)^2 = (x^2 + y^2 - 2 x y c1) c2^2.
</outline>
<outline>
2: the expanded form of the right-hand side (rhs) of the equation (x c1 - y)^2 = (x^2 + y^2 - 2 x y c1) c2^2.
</outline>
</goal>
<path>
1: the left-hand side of the equation (x c1 - y)^2 = (x^2 + y^2 - 2 x y c1) c2^2 is expanded to x^2 c1^2 - 2 x y c1 + y^2.
</path>
<path>
2: the right-hand side of the equation is expanded as (x^2 + y^2 - 2 x y c1) * c2^2.
</path>
<conclusion>
the left-hand side (lhs) of the equation is x^2 c1^2 - 2 x y c1 + y^2, and the right-hand side (rhs) of the equation is (x^2 + y^2 - 2 x y c1) c2^2.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
bring all terms to left:
x^2 c1^2 - 2 x y c1 + y^2 - (x^2 + y^2 - 2 x y c1) c2^2 = 0
expand the last term:
- x^2 c2^2 - y^2 c2^2 + 2 x y c1 c2^2
so combining terms:
x^2 (c1^2 - c2^2) + y^2 (1 - c2^2) - 2 x y c1 (1 - c2^2) = 0
wait, wait:
wait, let's check term by term:
1. x^2 term: c1^2 - c2^2
2. y^2 term: 1 - c2^2
3. xy term: -2 x y c1 + 2 x y c1 c2^2 = -2 x y c1 (1 - c2^2)
therefore, equation becomes:
x^2 (c1^2 - c2^2) + y^2 (1 - c2^2) - 2 x y c1 (1 - c2^2) = 0
factor out (1 - c2^2) from the last two terms:
x^2 (c1^2 - c2^2) + (1 - c2^2)(y^2 - 2 x y c1) = 0
hmm. let me compute c1 and c2:
cos(29°) ≈ 0.8746
cos(84°) ≈ 0.1045
so c1 ≈ 0.8746, c2 ≈ 0.1045
compute c1^2 - c2^2 ≈ (0.8746)^2 - (0.1045)^2 ≈ 0.7644 - 0.0109 ≈ 0.7535
1 - c2^2 ≈ 1 - 0.0109 ≈ 0.9891
so approximately, equation becomes:
0.7535 x^2 + 0.9891 (y^2 - 2 * 0.8746 x y) ≈ 0
but maybe it's better to keep it in exact terms. let's note that 1 - cos^2(84°) = sin^2(84°), since cos(84°) = sin(6°), so 1 - cos^2(84°) = sin^2(84°) ≈ (0.9945)^2 ≈ 0.9891, which matches. similarly, cos^2(29°) - cos^2(84°) can be written as (cos(29°) - cos(84°))(cos(29°) + cos(84°)). maybe.
alternatively, let me divide both sides of the equation by y^2 to make it in terms of (x/y)^2 and (x/y):
x^2 (c1^2 - c2^2) + (1 - c2^2)(y^2 - 2 x y c1) = 0
divide both sides by y^2:
(x^2 / y^2)(c1^2 - c2^2) + (1 - c2^2)(1 - 2 (x/y) c1) = 0
let me set k = x/y = |a| / |b|. then:
k2 (c12 - c22) + (1 - c22)(1 - 2 k c1) = 0
expand this:
k2 (c12 - c22) + (1 - c22) - 2 k c1 (1 - c22) = 0
rearranged:
(c12 - c22) k2 - 2 c1 (1 - c22) k + (1 - c22) = 0
this is a quadratic in terms of k. so:
a k2 + b k + c = 0, where
a = c12 - c22,
b = -2 c1 (1 - c22),
c = (1 - c22)
so, solving for k:
k = [2 c1 (1 - c22) ± sqrt(4 c12 (1 - c22)^2 - 4 (c12 - c22)(1 - c22))] / (2 (c12 - c22))
simplify numerator:
= [2 c1 (1 - c22) ± 2 sqrt(c12 (1 - c22)^2 - (c12 - c22)(1 - c22))] / (2 (c12 - c22))
cancel the 2 and factor sqrt:
= [c1 (1 - c22) ± sqrt((1 - c22)[c12 (1 - c22) - (c12 - c22)])] / (c12 - c22)
simplify inside the sqrt:
c12(1 - c22) - c12 + c22 = c12(1 - c22 - 1) + c22 = c12(-c22) + c22 = - c12 c22 + c22 = c22(1 - c12)
thus,
sqrt(c22(1 - c12)(1 - c22)) = c2 sqrt((1 - c12)(1 - c22))
therefore, numerator:
= [c1(1 - c22) ± c2 sqrt((1 - c12)(1 - c22)))] / (c12 - c22)
factor out sqrt(1 - c22):
= [sqrt(1 - c22) (c1 sqrt(1 - c22) ± c2 sqrt(1 - c12))] / (c12 - c22)
hmm, this is getting complicated. let me compute numerical values.
given c1 = cos(29°) ≈ 0.8746, c2 = cos(84°) ≈ 0.1045
compute c12 ≈ 0.7647, c22 ≈ 0.0109
a = c12 - c22 ≈ 0.7647 - 0.0109 ≈ 0.7538
b = -2 c1 (1 - c22) ≈ -2*0.8746*(1 - 0.0109) ≈ -2*0.8746*0.9891 ≈ -1.730
c = 1 - c22 ≈ 0.9891
discriminant d = b2 - 4ac ≈ (1.730)^2 - 4*0.7538*0.9891 ≈ 2.993 - 4*0.746 ≈ 2.993 - 2.984 ≈ 0.009
so sqrt(d) ≈ 0.0946
thus,
k = [1.730 ± 0.0946]/(2*0.7538)
denominator: 1.5076
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>
<goal>
<outline>
1: the numerical value of the first root (k1) of the quadratic equation for k.
</outline>
<outline>
2: the numerical value of the second root (k2) of the quadratic equation for k.
</outline>
</goal>
<path>
1: the first root (k1) is calculated as (1.730 - 0.0946) / 1.5076, which approximates to 1.6354 / 1.5076, yielding approximately 1.085.
</path>
<path>
2: the second root k2 is calculated as (1.730 - 0.0946) / 1.5076, which simplifies to approximately 1.6354 / 1.5076, yielding approximately 1.084.
</path>
<conclusion>
the quadratic equation for k yields two solutions: k1 ≈ 1.085 and k2 ≈ 1.084.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
wait, that can't be. wait, discriminant d is approximately 0.009, so sqrt(d) ≈ 0.0946. then:
numerator for k1: 1.730 + 0.0946 ≈ 1.8246
k1 ≈ 1.8246 / 1.5076 ≈ 1.21
numerator for k2: 1.730 - 0.0946 ≈ 1.6354
k2 ≈ 1.6354 / 1.5076 ≈ 1.085
so two possible solutions for k = |a|/|b|: approximately 1.21 or 1.085. hmm. but which one is correct? we need to check which one satisfies the original equation.
wait, but perhaps given that angles are given, maybe the ratio k is uniquely determined. wait, but the quadratic equation gives two solutions. hmm. maybe both solutions are valid, depending on the direction of vectors? wait, but vectors a and b have an angle of 29°, which is acute. the angle between b and (a - b) is 84°, also acute. so the geometry might restrict k to one solution. alternatively, maybe one solution is inadmissible. let's check.
but perhaps instead of getting numerical solutions, we can proceed symbolically. let's recall that we need to find the angle θ between a and (a - b). from equation 2:
cosθ = (x - y c1) / sqrt(x2 + y2 - 2 x y c1)
but x = k y, so substituting x = k y,
cosθ = (k y - y c1)/sqrt( (k y)^2 + y^2 - 2 k y^2 c1 )
factor y out:
= y (k - c1)/ [ y sqrt(k2 + 1 - 2 k c1 ) ]
= (k - c1)/sqrt(k2 + 1 - 2 k c1 )
therefore, cosθ = (k - c1)/sqrt( (k - c1)^2 + (1 - c1^2) )
wait, because k2 - 2 k c1 + 1 = (k - c1)^2 + (1 - c1^2)
wait, k2 + 1 - 2 k c1 = (k2 - 2 k c1 + c12) + 1 - c12 = (k - c1)^2 + (1 - c12)
therefore, sqrt(k2 + 1 - 2 k c1 ) = sqrt( (k - c1)^2 + (1 - c12) )
therefore, cosθ = (k - c1)/sqrt( (k - c1)^2 + (1 - c12) )
therefore, θ = arccos[ (k - c1)/sqrt( (k - c1)^2 + (1 - c12) ) ]
alternatively, note that this expression is similar to the formula for the angle between two vectors. let me see.
wait, if we consider in 2d, vector a is (k, 0), vector b is (c1, sqrt(1 - c12)), since angle with a is 29°. then, vector (a - b) is (k - c1, - sqrt(1 - c12)). then, the angle between a and (a - b) is given by:
cosθ = [(k)(k - c1) + (0)(- sqrt(1 - c12))]/ ( |a| |a - b| )
= [k(k - c1)] / ( sqrt(k2) * sqrt( (k - c1)^2 + ( - sqrt(1 - c12) )^2 ) )
= [k(k - c1)] / ( k * sqrt( (k - c1)^2 + (1 - c12) ) )
= (k - c1)/sqrt( (k - c1)^2 + (1 - c12) )
which matches the expression above. therefore, indeed, θ = arccos[ (k - c1)/sqrt( (k - c1)^2 + (1 - c12) ) ]
therefore, once we find k from equation 1, we can substitute into this formula. but from equation 1, we have two possible k values. so we need to check which k gives a real solution. but the problem is that the angles given in the problem might only allow one possible k. alternatively, since in equation 1, after squaring, we might have introduced an extraneous solution. therefore, we need to check which k satisfies the original equation.
recall equation 1:
x c1 - y = sqrt(x2 + y2 - 2 x y c1 ) c2
with x = k y, this becomes:
(k y) c1 - y = sqrt( k2 y2 + y2 - 2 k y2 c1 ) c2
factor y on the left:
y (k c1 - 1 ) = sqrt( y2 (k2 + 1 - 2 k c1 )) c2
= y sqrt( k2 + 1 - 2 k c1 ) c2
assuming y ≠ 0, divide both sides by y:
(k c1 - 1 ) = sqrt( k2 + 1 - 2 k c1 ) c2
therefore,
(k c1 - 1 ) / c2 = sqrt( k2 + 1 - 2 k c1 )
now, square both sides:
(k c1 - 1 )2 / c22 = ( k2 + 1 - 2 k c1 )
multiply both sides by c22:
(k c1 - 1 )2 = c22 ( k2 + 1 - 2 k c1 )
which is the same equation we had before. therefore, the quadratic in k gives two solutions, but we must check which one satisfies the original equation before squaring.
so compute for each k:
first, k ≈ 1.210
left-hand side: (1.210 * 0.8746 - 1 ) / 0.1045 ≈ (1.059 - 1)/0.1045 ≈ 0.059/0.1045 ≈ 0.5646
right-hand side: sqrt(1.2102 + 1 - 2*1.210*0.8746) ≈ sqrt(1.4641 +1 - 2.113) ≈ sqrt(0.3511) ≈ 0.5925
compare: 0.5646 vs 0.5925. not equal. so lhs ≈ 0.5646, rhs ≈ 0.5925. therefore, k ≈1.210 does not satisfy the original equation.
second, k ≈1.085
left-hand side: (1.085*0.8746 -1 ) /0.1045 ≈ (0.948 -1)/0.1045 ≈ (-0.052)/0.1045 ≈ -0.4976
right-hand side: sqrt(1.0852 +1 -2*1.085*0.8746) ≈ sqrt(1.177 +1 -1.853) ≈ sqrt(0.334) ≈ 0.578
but lhs is negative, rhs is positive. so they don't equal. hmm, neither solution works? that's strange.
wait, perhaps due to rounding errors. let's use more precise numbers.
let's compute c1 = cos(29°):
cos(29°) ≈ 0.8746197071
c2 = cos(84°) ≈ 0.1045284633
compute k1 and k2 more accurately.
first, quadratic equation:
a = c12 - c22 ≈ 0.7647 - 0.0109 ≈ 0.7538
b = -2 c1 (1 - c22) ≈ -2*0.8746197071*(1 - 0.010902) ≈ -2*0.8746197071*0.989098 ≈ -1.729
c = 1 - c22 ≈ 0.9891
discriminant d = b2 -4ac ≈ ( -1.729 )2 -4*(0.7538)*(0.9891) ≈ 2.990 - 3.003 ≈ -0.013
wait, negative discriminant? that can't be. wait, this is a problem. if the discriminant is negative, there are no real solutions. but we derived earlier that k must be a real number. contradiction.
wait, so perhaps my mistake was assuming that equation 1 would yield real solutions. but since the problem states that such vectors exist, there must be a real solution. therefore, maybe the approximations are to blame. let's compute d precisely.
compute b:
b = -2 c1 (1 - c22) = -2 * cos(29°) * (1 - cos2(84°))
compute 1 - cos2(84°) = sin2(84°)
so b = -2 cos(29°) sin2(84°)
similarly, compute a = cos2(29°) - cos2(84°)
c = 1 - cos2(84°) = sin2(84°)
therefore, discriminant d:
= [ -2 cos(29°) sin2(84°) ]2 - 4 [ cos2(29°) - cos2(84°) ] [ sin2(84°) ]
expand:
= 4 cos2(29°) sin^4(84°) - 4 [ cos2(29°) sin2(84°) - cos2(84°) sin2(84°) ]
= 4 cos2(29°) sin^4(84°) - 4 cos2(29°) sin2(84°) + 4 cos2(84°) sin2(84°)
factor:
= 4 cos2(84°) sin2(84°) + 4 cos2(29°) sin^4(84°) - 4 cos2(29°) sin2(84°)
factor common terms:
= 4 cos2(29°) sin2(84°) [ sin2(84°) - 1 ] + 4 cos2(84°) sin2(84°)
but sin2(84°) -1 = -cos2(84°)
so:
= 4 cos2(84°) sin2(84°) - 4 cos2(29°) sin2(84°) cos2(84° )
= 4 cos2(84°) sin2(84°) [1 - cos2(29°)]
but 1 - cos2(29°) = sin2(29°)
thus:
d = 4 cos2(84°) sin2(84°) sin2(29°)
therefore, d is positive. so sqrt(d) = 2 cos(84°) sin(84°) sin(29°)
thus, solutions for k:
k = [ 2 cos(29°) sin2(84° ) ± 2 cos(84°) sin(84° ) sin(29°
