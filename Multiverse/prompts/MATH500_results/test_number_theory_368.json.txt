Okay, so I need to convert the decimal number 999 (which is base 10) to base 6. I remember that to convert a number from base 10 to another base, you repeatedly divide the number by the new base and keep track of the remainders. Then, the remainders become the digits of the new number, read from bottom to top. Let me try that step by step.
First, let's divide 999 by 6. 6 goes into 999 how many times? Well, 6 times 166 is 996, because 6 times 100 is 600, 6 times 160 is 960, then 6 times 6 is 36, so 166 times 6 is 996. 999 minus 996 is 3. So the remainder is 3. Let me write that down: Division 1: 999 ÷ 6 = 166 with a remainder of 3.
So the least significant digit (rightmost) in base 6 is 3. Now, take the quotient 166 and divide that by 6. Division 2: 166 ÷ 6. Let's see, 6 times 27 is 162. 166 - 162 is 4. So the remainder is 4. So the next digit is 4. Quotient is 27.
Now, divide 27 by 6. Division 3: 27 ÷ 6. 6 times 4 is 24. 27 - 24 is 3. Remainder is 3. Quotient is 4.
Divide 4 by 6. Division 4: 4 ÷ 6. Well, 6 goes into 4 zero times, so the remainder is 4. And the quotient is 0.
So now, we can stop since the quotient is zero.
Let's think in parallel.

<Goal>
<Outline>
1: The digits of the base 6 number as determined from the remainders of the division steps.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: The sequence of base 6 digits from least significant to most significant, and the need for reordering.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The remainders obtained from the division steps, read from bottom to top, are 4, 3, 4, 3.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The digits obtained from the division steps, when read in the order they were obtained (from the first division to the last), are 3, 4, 3, 4. These digits correspond to the least significant digit first and the most significant digit last.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The division steps produced remainders 3, 4, 3, 4. These remainders, which represent the base 6 digits starting from the least significant digit, need to be arranged in the correct order for the final number.
</Conclusion>

Wait, so starting from the last division to the first, the remainders are 4, 3, 4, 3. So the base 6 number is 4343_6. Let me verify that.

1: The verification of the base 6 number 4343 by converting it back to base 10.

<Outline>
2: The verification of the base 6 number 4343 by calculating the number of digits and the highest digit value for a base 6 representation of 999.

3: The verification of the base 6 number 4343 by comparing it to the result of a direct conversion algorithm.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The base 6 number 4343 is converted back to base 10. Each digit is multiplied by the corresponding power of 6. The calculation is 4*6^3 + 3*6^2 + 4*6^1 + 3*6^0. This evaluates to 4*216 + 3*36 + 4*6 + 3*1, which is 864 + 108 + 24 + 3. The sum of these products is 864 + 108 = 972, then 972 + 24 = 996, and finally 996 + 3 = 999. The conversion back to base 10 results in 999, confirming the correctness of the base 6 number 4343.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The base 6 equivalent of 999 is considered. The value 6^4 is 1296, which exceeds 999. The value 6^3 is 216. The calculation 999 divided by 216 yields approximately 4.625. This indicates that the base 6 number will have four digits. The first digit (the coefficient for 6^3) is 4, as 4*216 equals 864. The remainder is 999 - 864 = 135. The next digit is determined by dividing the remainder 135 by 6^2 (36). This division gives 3, because 3*36 equals 108. The new remainder is 135 - 108 = 27. The subsequent digit is found by dividing the remainder 27 by 6^1 (6), resulting in 4, as 4*6 equals 24. The final remainder is 27 - 24 = 3. This remainder corresponds to the least significant digit. The base 6 number is thus 4*6^3 + 3*6^2 + 4*6^1 + 3*6^0, which is 4343_6.

<Conclusion>
The direct conversion algorithm, when applied to 999, produces the remainders 3, 4, 3, and 4 in sequence, from least significant to most significant.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
The recorded remainders, when read in reverse order (from last to first), form the base 6 number 4343.

<Conclusion>
The conversion of the base 6 number 4343 back to base 10 yields 999, confirming its accuracy. The base 6 number 4343 is also consistent with the expected number of digits for a base 6 representation of 999. The direct application of the standard conversion algorithm, using repeated division by 6 and collecting remainders, independently confirms that 999 in base 10 is 4343 in base 6.

</Think>

Answer: To convert the decimal number \(999_{10}\) to base 6, we repeatedly divide the number by 6 and keep track of the remainders. 

1. \(999 \div 6 = 166\) with a remainder of \(3\).
2. \(166 \div 6 = 27\) with a remainder of \(4\).
3. \(27 \div 6 = 4\) with a remainder of \(3\).
4. \(4 \div 6 = 0\) with a remainder of \(4\).

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 6 number \(4343_6\). 

Verification by converting back to decimal:
\[4 \times 6^3 + 3 \times 6^2 + 4 \times 6^1 + 3 \times 6^0 = 864 + 108 + 24 + 3 = 999\]

The final answer is \(\boxed{4343_6}\).

now, divide 27 by 6. division 3: 27 ÷ 6. 6 times 4 is 24. 27 - 24 is 3. remainder is 3. quotient is 4.
divide 4 by 6. division 4: 4 ÷ 6. well, 6 goes into 4 zero times, so the remainder is 4. and the quotient is 0.
so now, we can stop since the quotient is zero.
