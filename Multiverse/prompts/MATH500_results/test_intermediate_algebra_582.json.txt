Okay, let me try to solve this problem.
The equation given is \(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\).
I need to find the sum of the reciprocals of the products of five pairs of complex conjugate roots.
The roots are given as \(r_1, \overline{r}_1, r_2, \overline{r}_2, r_3, \overline{r}_3, r_4, \overline{r}_4, r_5, \overline{r}_5\).
The question is to compute \(\frac{1}{r_1 \overline{r}_1} + \frac{1}{r_2 \overline{r}_2} + \frac{1}{r_3 \overline{r}_3} + \frac{1}{r_4 \overline{r}_4} + \frac{1}{r_5 \overline{r}_5}\).
First, I know that for a polynomial with real coefficients, the complex roots come in conjugate pairs.
This equation seems to have real coefficients because 13 and 1 are real numbers.
So that makes sense why the roots are given as conjugate pairs.

1.1: Maybe if I let \(y = 13x - 1\), then the equation becomes \(x^{10} + y^{10} = 0\).
But x and y are related here.
Not sure if that helps.
Alternatively, perhaps set \(x^{10} = -(13x - 1)^{10}\).
Then, taking tenth roots, we get \(x = e^{i\pi(2k+1)/10}(1 - 13x)\) for \(k = 0, 1, ..., 9\).
Hmm, but that might lead to solving 10 different equations, which seems messy.

1.2: Alternatively, maybe substitute \(y = 13x\).
Then \(x = \frac{y}{13}\).
Substitute into the equation: \((\frac{y}{13})^{10} + (y - 1)^{10} = 0\).
Hmm, maybe not immediately helpful.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
Substituting \(y = 13x - 1\) complicates the relation between x and y. Substituting \(y = 13x\) transforms the equation to \((y/13)^{10} + (y-1)^{10} = 0\), which also seems difficult to solve directly. Both substitutions did not immediately simplify the problem.

2: Wait, maybe not.
Let me check again.
The equation is \(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\).
If we let \(y = 13x - 1\), then the equation becomes \(x^{10} + y^{10} = 0\).
But substituting back \(y = 13x - 1\), we have \(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\).
Alternatively, perhaps write \(x^{10} = -(13x - 1)^{10}\).
Taking the 10th roots of both sides, but that might involve working with complex numbers.
Alternatively, perhaps think about factoring the equation.
Let me see.
Let me rearrange the equation: \(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\).

The approach of expanding the polynomial is considered too complex. Substituting x = 1/(13y) is noted as a possible strategy.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Let me think.
Let's set \(y = 1/x\).
Then, substituting \(x = 1/y\), the equation becomes:
\((1/y)^{10} + (13/y - 1)^{10} = 0\).
Multiply both sides by \(y^{10}\) to eliminate denominators:
\(1 + (13 - y)^{10} = 0\).
So this becomes \(1 + (13 - y)^{10} = 0\).
Which implies \((13 - y)^{10} = -1\).
So 13 - y is a 10th root of -1.
Therefore, \(13 - y = e^{(1 + 2k)\pi i /10}\), for \(k = 0, 1, ..., 9\).
Thus, \(y = 13 \pm e^{(1 + 2k)\pi i /10}\).
Wait, no, the roots of -1 are \(e^{(1 + 2k)\pi i /10}\).
So \(13 - y = e^{(1 + 2k)\pi i /10}\), hence \(y = 13 - e^{(1 + 2k)\pi i /10}\).
Therefore, the roots \(y\) are \(13 - e^{(1 + 2k)\pi i /10}\) for \(k = 0\) to \(9\).
Then, since \(y = 1/x\), the roots \(x\) are \(1/(13 - e^{(1 + 2k)\pi i /10})\).
Therefore, each root \(x\) is \(1/(13 - \omega_k)\), where \(\omega_k\) are the 10th roots of -1.

But the problem is asking for the sum over \(1/(r_i \overline{r_i})\).
Since each root is \(1/(13 - \omega_k)\), let's denote \(r_k = 1/(13 - \omega_k)\).
Then, the product \(r_i \overline{r_i}\) is \(|r_i|^2\).
So, \(1/(r_i \overline{r_i}) = 1/|r_i|^2 = |13 - \omega_i|^2\).
Wait, because \(r_i = 1/(13 - \omega_i)\), so the modulus squared is \(|1/(13 - \omega_i)|^2 = 1/|13 - \omega_i|^2\).
Therefore, \(1/(r_i \overline{r_i}) = |13 - \omega_i|^2\).
Therefore, the problem reduces to summing \(|13 - \omega_i|^2\) over the five pairs of roots.
But wait, since the roots are \(x = 1/(13 - \omega)\), and \(\omega\) are the roots of \(w^{10} = -1\).
Each \(\omega_k = e^{(1 + 2k)\pi i /10}\).
So they lie on the unit circle in the complex plane, but rotated by angles corresponding to 10th roots of -1, which is a rotation of odd multiples of \(\pi/10\).
So each \(\omega_k\) is at an angle of \(\pi/10 + 2k\pi/10\).
Therefore, \(13 - \omega_k\) is 13 minus a point on the unit circle.
Then, \(|13 - \omega_k|^2 = (13 - \omega_k)(13 - \overline{\omega}_k)\).
Since \(\omega_k\) are roots of -1, which are on the unit circle, so \(\overline{\omega}_k = 1/\omega_k\).
Wait, actually, since \(|\omega_k| = 1\), because they are roots of unity (or roots of -1, which have modulus 1).
Therefore, \(\overline{\omega}_k = 1/\omega_k\).
Therefore, \(|13 - \omega_k|^2 = (13 - \omega_k)(13 - 1/\omega_k)\).
Let's think in parallel.

The product (13 - ω_k)(13 - 1/ω_k) is expanded and then simplified.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So, 169 - 13(\(\omega_k + 1/\omega_k\) ) + 1.
Therefore, \(|13 - \omega_k|^2 = 170 - 13(\omega_k + 1/\omega_k)\).
But \(\omega_k + 1/\omega_k = 2\cos\theta_k\), where \(\theta_k = (1 + 2k)\pi/10\).
Because \(e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta\).
Therefore, \(|13 - \omega_k|^2 = 170 - 26\cos\theta_k\).
So, each term in the sum \(1/(r_i \overline{r}_i)\) is equal to \(170 - 26\cos\theta_k\).
Wait, but the problem is asking for the sum over these terms for five pairs.
But the original equation is degree 10, so there are 10 roots, which are paired as complex conjugates.
Therefore, the five terms correspond to five pairs of conjugate roots.
Wait, but each \(\omega_k\) also comes in conjugate pairs.
Let me check: For \(\omega_k = e^{(1 + 2k)\pi i/10}\), then \(\overline{\omega}_k = e^{- (1 + 2k)\pi i /10}\).
But is this equal to \(\omega_{10 - k}\)?
Let's see: For k from 0 to 9, \(\omega_k = e^{(1 + 2k)\pi i/10}\).
Then, \(\omega_{10 - k} = e^{(1 + 2(10 - k))\pi i /10} = e^{(1 + 20 - 2k)\pi i /10} = e^{(21 - 2k)\pi i /10} = e^{(1 - 2k)\pi i /10 + 2\pi i} = e^{(1 - 2k)\pi i /10}\).
Which is \(e^{- (1 + 2k)\pi i /10}\) because \(1 - 2k = - (1 + 2k) + 2(k + 1)\), but actually, perhaps easier: e^{(21 - 2k)\pi i /10} = e^{(21\pi i - 2k\pi i)/10} = e^{(21\pi i)/10}e^{-2k\pi i/10} = but since e^{21\pi i/10} = e^{(20\pi i + \pi i)/10} = e^{2\pi i + \pi i/10} = e^{\pi i/10} (because e^{2\pi i} = 1).
Wait, but e^{21\pi i /10} is equivalent to e^{\pi i /10} in angle, so actually, \(\omega_{10 - k} = e^{(21 - 2k)\pi i /10} = e^{(\pi i /10 + 2\pi i)} = e^{\pi i /10}\), but that might not capture the full angle.
Wait, perhaps a different approach.
The angles for \(\omega_k\) are \(\pi/10, 3\pi/10, 5\pi/10, ..., up to 19\pi/10\).
Wait, since k ranges from 0 to 9, (1 + 2k) ranges from 1 to 21, so (1 + 2k)\pi/10 ranges from \pi/10 (k=0) to 21\pi/10 (k=9).
But since angles are modulo 2π, 21\pi/10 is equivalent to 21\pi/10 - 2π = (21\pi - 20\pi)/10 = \pi/10.
Wait, so actually, when k=10, if allowed, we would get back to \pi/10, but since k stops at 9, maybe it's better to represent each angle as ((1 + 2k) mod 20)\pi/10.
But maybe I need not go into that.
The point is, each \(\omega_k\) is a root of -1, so they are equally spaced on the unit circle at angles \(\pi/10, 3\pi/10, 5\pi/10,...,19\pi/10\).
So, for each \(\omega_k\), its conjugate is \(\omega_{k'}\) where k' is such that the angle is negative.
But since the angles are \(\theta_k = (1 + 2k)\pi/10\), then \(\overline{\omega}_k = e^{-i\theta_k} = e^{-i(1 + 2k)\pi/10}\).
This would correspond to \(\omega_{-k}\) if we allow negative k.
But since k ranges from 0 to 9, perhaps we can represent the conjugate as \(\omega_{10 - k}\).
Let me check for k=0: \(\theta_0 = \pi/10\), so \(\overline{\omega}_0 = e^{-i\pi/10}\).
If k=5, \(\theta_5 = (1 + 10)\pi/10 = 11\pi/10\).
Then \(\overline{\omega}_5 = e^{-11\pi i/10}\), which is equivalent to \(e^{\pi i/10}\) since -11π/10 + 2π = π/10.
But this is the same as \(\omega_0\).
Wait, maybe there's a more straightforward way.
Since the roots \(\omega_k\) are symmetric in the unit circle, each root has a conjugate root.
For polynomial equations with real coefficients, the roots come in conjugate pairs.
But the polynomial for \(\omega\) here is \(w^{10} + 1 = 0\), which has complex coefficients (since the constant term is 1, which is real, but the equation is satisfied by complex roots).
However, the original equation in x has real coefficients, so the roots x must come in complex conjugate pairs.
So, the roots \(x = 1/(13 - \omega_k)\) must come in conjugate pairs.
Therefore, if \(x = 1/(13 - \omega_k)\) is a root, then so is its conjugate \(1/(13 - \overline{\omega}_k) = 1/(13 - 1/\omega_k)\), since \(\overline{\omega}_k = 1/\omega_k\) because \(|\omega_k|=1\).
But maybe we need to pair these roots.
Alternatively, perhaps note that since \(\omega_k\) are roots of \(w^{10} + 1 = 0\), then each \(\omega_k\) satisfies \(\omega_k^{10} = -1\).
Thus, the minimal polynomials over the reals would pair conjugate roots.
So, for each root \(\omega_k = e^{(1 + 2k)\pi i /10}\), its conjugate is \(\omega_{10 - k}\).
Therefore, when we form the roots \(x = 1/(13 - \omega_k)\), the conjugate root is \(1/(13 - \overline{\omega}_k) = 1/(13 - 1/\omega_k)\).
But perhaps to pair them, we need to see when \(1/(13 - \omega_k)\) and \(1/(13 - 1/\omega_k)\) are roots.
Let me check if \(1/(13 - \omega_k)\) and \(1/(13 - 1/\omega_k)\) are conjugates.
Let me take the conjugate of \(1/(13 - \omega_k)\).
Since 13 is real, and \(\overline{\omega}_k = 1/\omega_k\), we have:
\(\overline{(1/(13 - \omega_k))} = 1/(13 - \overline{\omega}_k) = 1/(13 - 1/\omega_k)\).
But \(1/(13 - 1/\omega_k) = \omega_k/(13\omega_k - 1)\).
However, if we consider the original equation \(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\), substituting \(x = \omega_k/(13\omega_k - 1)\), let's check if this satisfies the equation.
Wait, perhaps not.
Alternatively, note that if \(x = 1/(13 - \omega_k)\), then \(13x - 1 = (\omega_k)/(13 - \omega_k)\).
Let's think in parallel.

<Conclusion>
The expressions for x^10 and (13x - 1)^10 are derived.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Sum the two terms: \(1/(13 - \omega_k)^{10} + (\omega_k)^{10}/(13 - \omega_k)^{10} = [1 + (\omega_k)^{10}]/(13 - \omega_k)^{10}\).
But \(\omega_k^{10} = -1\), so numerator is 1 + (-1) = 0.
Hence, the equation is satisfied.
So, \(x = 1/(13 - \omega_k)\) are indeed roots.
So, since each root \(x = 1/(13 - \omega_k)\) has a conjugate root \(1/(13 - 1/\omega_k)\), which can be written as \(\omega_k/(13\omega_k - 1)\).
But perhaps more importantly, the roots come in conjugate pairs, so when we sum \(1/(r_i \overline{r}_i)\) over the five pairs, each term is \(|13 - \omega_k|^2\).
Therefore, the total sum is the sum over all distinct pairs (i.e., for each of the five pairs) of \(|13 - \omega_k|^2\).
But since each \(\omega_k\) is related to a unique root, but we need to make sure we're not double-counting.
Since the roots \(\omega_k\) are symmetric, but each \(\omega_k\) is associated with a unique \(|13 - \omega_k|^2\).
However, since the problem specifies five pairs of roots, perhaps we need to sum over each unique pair once.
But actually, since all roots come in conjugate pairs, and the equation is degree 10, there are five such pairs.
Therefore, the sum is over all \(|13 - \omega_k|^2\) for each unique \(\omega_k\) in one of the five pairs.
Wait, but the roots \(\omega_k\) are from k = 0 to 9, but since they are symmetric, each pair of \(\omega_k\) and \(\overline{\omega}_k\) corresponds to a pair of roots in the original equation.
But given the way the problem is structured, with roots \(r_1, \overline{r}_1,...,r_5, \overline{r}_5\), then each pair \(r_i, \overline{r}_i\) corresponds to a pair of reciprocals related to some \(\omega_k\) and \(\overline{\omega}_k\).
But we can proceed as follows.
Since each root \(r_i = 1/(13 - \omega_k)\), then \(1/(r_i \overline{r}_i) = |13 - \omega_k|^2\).
Therefore, the sum is over all five pairs, so each distinct \(\omega_k\) (considering that conjugate roots would correspond to the same term?).
Wait, no.
If \(r_i = 1/(13 - \omega_k)\), then \(\overline{r}_i = 1/(13 - \overline{\omega}_k)\).
Then, \(1/(r_i \overline{r}_i) = (13 - \omega_k)(13 - \overline{\omega}_k) = |13 - \omega_k|^2\).
Which is \(170 - 26\cos\theta_k\) as we found earlier.
Therefore, since the roots \(\omega_k\) are at angles \(\theta_k = \pi/10, 3\pi/10, 5\pi/10, 7\pi/10, 9\pi/10, ..., 19\pi/10\), but since cosine is even, \(\cos(\theta) = \cos(-\theta) = \cos(2\pi - \theta)\).
Therefore, for each angle \(\theta\), we have a pair of roots at \(\theta\) and \(2\pi - \theta\), which would have the same cosine value.
But since the original equation in x has real coefficients, the roots come in conjugate pairs, so for each root \(1/(13 - \omega_k)\), there is a conjugate root \(1/(13 - \overline{\omega}_k)\).
However, in terms of the sum over \(1/(r_i \overline{r}_i)\), each pair contributes a term which is \(|13 - \omega_k|^2\).
But because each pair is just two complex numbers whose product is \(|13 - \omega_k|^2\), we need to count each unique pair once.
But the problem specifies that the roots are given as five pairs of conjugates, so we need to compute the sum over the five pairs.
However, since each pair's contribution is \(|13 - \omega_k|^2 + |13 - \overline{\omega}_k|^2\), but wait, no.
Wait, actually, each pair \(r_i, \overline{r}_i\) contributes only one term to the sum: \(1/(r_i \overline{r}_i)\).
But since \(r_i \overline{r}_i = |r_i|^2\), and \(1/(r_i \overline{r}_i) = 1/|r_i|^2\).
But previously, we saw that \(1/(r_i \overline{r}_i) = |13 - \omega_k|^2\).
So, for each root \(r_i = 1/(13 - \omega_k)\), its conjugate is \(\overline{r}_i = 1/(13 - \overline{\omega}_k)\).
Then, the product \(r_i \overline{r}_i = [1/(13 - \omega_k)][1/(13 - \overline{\omega}_k)] = 1/|13 - \omega_k|^2\).
Therefore, \(1/(r_i \overline{r}_i) = |13 - \omega_k|^2\).
So, each pair contributes \(|13 - \omega_k|^2\), but since \(\omega_k\) and \(\overline{\omega}_k\) are distinct (unless \(\omega_k\) is real), which in this case, the roots of -1 are on the unit circle.
The only real roots of \(w^{10} = -1\) are at \(\theta = \pi\) and \(\theta = 0\)?
Wait, no, \(\theta = \pi\) is a root of \(w^{10} = 1\).
Wait, the equation \(w^{10} = -1\) has roots at \(\theta = \pi/10 + 2k\pi/10\).
The real axis is at \(\theta = 0\) and \(\theta = \pi\).
So, to check if any of the roots \(\omega_k\) are real:
For \(\theta_k = \pi/10, 3\pi/10, 5\pi/10, 7\pi/10, 9\pi/10, 11\pi/10, 13\pi/10, 15\pi/10, 17\pi/10, 19\pi/10\).
The angles \(5\pi/10 = \pi/2\) and \(15\pi/10 = 3\pi/2\) are purely imaginary.
The angle \(10\pi/10 = \pi\) would be real, but that's \(w^{10} = -1\) which is \(\theta = \pi\), but \(\pi\) is already an angle for roots of unity for \(w^{10} = 1\) if n=10.
Wait, no.
The roots of \(w^{10} = -1\) are at angles \(\theta = (\pi + 2k\pi)/10 + \pi/10\)?
Wait, maybe I'm confusing.
Actually, the roots of \(w^{10} = -1\) can be written as \(w = e^{(2k + 1)\pi i /10}\) for \(k = 0, 1, ..., 9\).
So, angles \(\pi/10, 3\pi/10, 5\pi/10, 7\pi/10, 9\pi/10, 11\pi/10, 13\pi/10, 15\pi/10, 17\pi/10, 19\pi/10\).
Among these, the angles that are \(\pi\) radians (180 degrees) would make w = -1, but \(5\pi/10 = \pi/2\) and \(10\pi/10 = \pi\), but wait, in the list, the angles go up to 19\pi/10.
So, 5\pi/10 is \(\pi/2\), which is 90 degrees, leading to w being purely imaginary.
Similarly, 10\pi/10 is \(\pi\), but that would be angle \(\pi\), but that is not included in the roots because (2k +1)\pi/10 for k from 0 to 9 gives odd multiples of \pi/10.
So, angle \(\pi\) is 10\pi/10, which would correspond to k = 9: (2*9 +1)\pi/10 = 19\pi/10.
So, none of the roots are real.
Therefore, all roots \(\omega_k\) are non-real and come in conjugate pairs.
Therefore, the roots \(1/(13 - \omega_k)\) also come in conjugate pairs.
Therefore, the five pairs of roots in the problem correspond to five different \(\omega_k\) with their conjugates.
Therefore, each distinct \(\omega_k\) with k = 0 to 4 would pair with k = 5 to 9, which are their conjugates.
Therefore, the sum over the five terms \(|13 - \omega_k|^2\) for k = 0 to 4.
But each term for k and 10 -k would give the same cosine value because \(\cos(\theta_k) = \cos(-\theta_k) = \cos(\theta_{10 -k}))\).
Wait, but since theta_k is (1 + 2k)pi/10, then theta_{10 -k} = (1 + 2*(10 -k))pi/10 = (21 - 2k)pi/10 = (21pi/10 - 2kpi/10) = equivalent angle to (21pi/10 - 2kpi/10 - 2pi) if that brings it within 0 to 2pi.
Wait, 21pi/10 - 2pi = (21pi - 20pi)/10 = pi/10.
So, theta_{10 -k} = pi/10 + ( - 2kpi/10 ) + 2pi?
Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the cosine.
Since theta_{10 -k} = (21 - 2k)pi/10.
Then cos(theta_{10 -k}) = cos((21 - 2k)pi/10) = cos(2pi - (21 - 2k)pi/10) = cos(( -1)pi/10 + 2kpi/10) = cos(-pi/10 + 2kpi/10) = cos(pi/10 - 2kpi/10) = cos(theta_k - 2pi/10*(k)).
Wait, maybe that's not helpful.
Alternatively, because theta_{10 -k} = (21 -2k)pi/10 = (20pi/10 + (1 -2k)pi/10) = 2pi + (1 -2k)pi/10.
But cos is 2pi periodic, so cos(theta_{10 -k}) = cos((1 -2k)pi/10) = cos(- (1 + (-2k -1) +1 )).
Wait, perhaps it's easier to note that theta_{10 -k} = (21 -2k)pi/10.
Then, (21 -2k)pi/10 = (20pi/10 + (1 -2k)pi/10) = 2pi + (1 -2k)pi/10.
Since cosine has period 2pi, cos(theta_{10 -k}) = cos((1 -2k)pi/10).
But (1 -2k)pi/10 is the negative of (2k -1)pi/10.
Therefore, cos(theta_{10 -k}) = cos(-(2k -1)pi/10) = cos((2k -1)pi/10) = cos(theta_k).
Therefore, cos(theta_{10 -k}) = cos(theta_k).
Therefore, |13 - \omega_k|^2 = 170 -26cos(theta_k) and |13 - \omega_{10 -k}|^2 = 170 -26cos(theta_{10 -k}) = 170 -26cos(theta_k).
Therefore, for each k, the pair (k, 10 -k) gives the same value of |13 - \omega|^2.
Therefore, since the ten roots are paired as (k, 10 -k), each with the same |13 - \omega_k|^2.
But the problem says that the original equation's roots are given as five pairs of conjugates, so each unique pair contributes two roots with the same |13 - \omega|^2.
But in the sum, we only need to compute five terms, each equal to 170 -26cos(theta_k) for k = 0 to 4, or some other indexing.
Wait, but the problem says the roots are r1, overline{r}1, etc.
So, each pair (r_i, overline{r}_i) corresponds to some (1/(13 - \omega_k), 1/(13 - \overline{\omega}_k)).
Then, according to the problem, the sum is over five terms 1/(r_i overline{r}_i), each of which is |13 - \omega_k|^2.
But since each pair (r_i, overline{r}_i) corresponds to a specific \omega_k, and because of the cosine term, each unique \omega_k (up to conjugation) contributes once.
Therefore, to compute the sum, we need to compute the sum over distinct cos(theta_k) for k from 0 to 4 (or any five indices which are not conjugate pairs).
Wait, but maybe all ten roots can be grouped into five pairs, each with the same |13 - \omega_k|^2.
Since theta_k and theta_{10 -k} have the same cosine, hence same |13 - \omega|^2.
Therefore, the ten roots can be grouped into five pairs, each pair (k, 10 -k) with the same |13 - \omega|^2.
Therefore, the sum over the five terms would be sum_{k=0}^4 (170 -26cos(theta_k))?
But since each pair (k,10 -k) gives the same value, but if we have five pairs, each corresponding to a unique k in 0 to 4, but actually, the angles for k from 0 to 9 are symmetric.
Let's list them:
k=0: theta= pi/10 --> 18 degrees
k=1: 3pi/10 --> 54 degrees
k=2:5pi/10=pi/2 --> 90 degrees
k=3:7pi/10 --> 126 degrees
k=4:9pi/10 --> 162 degrees
k=5:11pi/10 --> 198 degrees
k=6:13pi/10 --> 234 degrees
k=7:15pi/10 --> 270 degrees
k=8:17pi/10 --> 306 degrees
k=9:19pi/10 --> 342 degrees
But angles over 180 degrees can be represented as negative angles:
11pi/10 = pi + pi/10 (angle 198 degrees = -162 degrees)
13pi/10 = pi + 3pi/10 (234 degrees = -126<Conclusion>

<think>
okay, let me try to solve this problem.
the equation given is \(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\).
i need to find the sum of the reciprocals of the products of five pairs of complex conjugate roots.
the roots are given as \(r_1, \overline{r}_1, r_2, \overline{r}_2, r_3, \overline{r}_3, r_4, \overline{r}_4, r_5, \overline{r}_5\).
the question is to compute \(\frac{1}{r_1 \overline{r}_1} + \frac{1}{r_2 \overline{r}_2} + \frac{1}{r_3 \overline{r}_3} + \frac{1}{r_4 \overline{r}_4} + \frac{1}{r_5 \overline{r}_5}\).
first, i know that for a polynomial with real coefficients, the complex roots come in conjugate pairs.
this equation seems to have real coefficients because 13 and 1 are real numbers.
so that makes sense why the roots are given as conjugate pairs.
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>
<goal>
<outline>
1: explore substitutions to simplify the equation and analyze symmetry.
</outline>
<outline>
2: analyze the equation's properties and structure, including the nature of roots and the role of reciprocals.
</outline>
</goal>
<path>
1: the equation is \(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\).
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>
<goal>
<outline>
1.1: consider substituting \(y = 13x - 1\).
</outline>
<outline>
1.2: consider substituting \(y = 13x\).
</outline>
</goal>
<path>
1.1: maybe if i let \(y = 13x - 1\), then the equation becomes \(x^{10} + y^{10} = 0\).
but x and y are related here.
not sure if that helps.
alternatively, perhaps set \(x^{10} = -(13x - 1)^{10}\).
then, taking tenth roots, we get \(x = e^{i\pi(2k+1)/10}(1 - 13x)\) for \(k = 0, 1, ..., 9\).
hmm, but that might lead to solving 10 different equations, which seems messy.
</path>
<path>
1.2: alternatively, maybe substitute \(y = 13x\).
then \(x = \frac{y}{13}\).
substitute into the equation: \((\frac{y}{13})^{10} + (y - 1)^{10} = 0\).
hmm, maybe not immediately helpful.
</path>
<conclusion>
substituting \(y = 13x - 1\) complicates the relation between x and y. substituting \(y = 13x\) transforms the equation to \((y/13)^{10} + (y-1)^{10} = 0\), which also seems difficult to solve directly. both substitutions did not immediately simplify the problem.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
</path>
<path>
2: wait, maybe not.
let me check again.
the equation is \(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\).
if we let \(y = 13x - 1\), then the equation becomes \(x^{10} + y^{10} = 0\).
but substituting back \(y = 13x - 1\), we have \(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\).
alternatively, perhaps write \(x^{10} = -(13x - 1)^{10}\).
taking the 10th roots of both sides, but that might involve working with complex numbers.
alternatively, perhaps think about factoring the equation.
let me see.
let me rearrange the equation: \(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\).

<path>
2.1: alternatively, expand the polynomial and try to find some relations, but expanding \((13x - 1)^{10}\) would be time-consuming, but maybe there is a smarter way.
</path>
<path>
2.2: alternatively, perhaps substitute \(x = \frac{1}{13} + t\) to see if that simplifies anything.
but maybe not.
alternatively, note that the equation is symmetric in some way.
if i let \(y = 1/x\), perhaps that could lead to some reciprocal relationship.
</path>
<conclusion>
the approach of expanding the polynomial is considered too complex. substituting x = 1/(13y) is noted as a possible strategy.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
let me think.
let's set \(y = 1/x\).
then, substituting \(x = 1/y\), the equation becomes:
\((1/y)^{10} + (13/y - 1)^{10} = 0\).
multiply both sides by \(y^{10}\) to eliminate denominators:
\(1 + (13 - y)^{10} = 0\).
so this becomes \(1 + (13 - y)^{10} = 0\).
which implies \((13 - y)^{10} = -1\).
so 13 - y is a 10th root of -1.
therefore, \(13 - y = e^{(1 + 2k)\pi i /10}\), for \(k = 0, 1, ..., 9\).
thus, \(y = 13 \pm e^{(1 + 2k)\pi i /10}\).
wait, no, the roots of -1 are \(e^{(1 + 2k)\pi i /10}\).
so \(13 - y = e^{(1 + 2k)\pi i /10}\), hence \(y = 13 - e^{(1 + 2k)\pi i /10}\).
therefore, the roots \(y\) are \(13 - e^{(1 + 2k)\pi i /10}\) for \(k = 0\) to \(9\).
then, since \(y = 1/x\), the roots \(x\) are \(1/(13 - e^{(1 + 2k)\pi i /10})\).
therefore, each root \(x\) is \(1/(13 - \omega_k)\), where \(\omega_k\) are the 10th roots of -1.

the relationship between roots x and y is established, and the expression for y_k is provided.

</conclusion>
</parallel>
but the problem is asking for the sum over \(1/(r_i \overline{r_i})\).
since each root is \(1/(13 - \omega_k)\), let's denote \(r_k = 1/(13 - \omega_k)\).
then, the product \(r_i \overline{r_i}\) is \(|r_i|^2\).
so, \(1/(r_i \overline{r_i}) = 1/|r_i|^2 = |13 - \omega_i|^2\).
wait, because \(r_i = 1/(13 - \omega_i)\), so the modulus squared is \(|1/(13 - \omega_i)|^2 = 1/|13 - \omega_i|^2\).
therefore, \(1/(r_i \overline{r_i}) = |13 - \omega_i|^2\).
therefore, the problem reduces to summing \(|13 - \omega_i|^2\) over the five pairs of roots.
but wait, since the roots are \(x = 1/(13 - \omega)\), and \(\omega\) are the roots of \(w^{10} = -1\).
each \(\omega_k = e^{(1 + 2k)\pi i /10}\).
so they lie on the unit circle in the complex plane, but rotated by angles corresponding to 10th roots of -1, which is a rotation of odd multiples of \(\pi/10\).
so each \(\omega_k\) is at an angle of \(\pi/10 + 2k\pi/10\).
therefore, \(13 - \omega_k\) is 13 minus a point on the unit circle.
then, \(|13 - \omega_k|^2 = (13 - \omega_k)(13 - \overline{\omega}_k)\).
since \(\omega_k\) are roots of -1, which are on the unit circle, so \(\overline{\omega}_k = 1/\omega_k\).
wait, actually, since \(|\omega_k| = 1\), because they are roots of unity (or roots of -1, which have modulus 1).
therefore, \(\overline{\omega}_k = 1/\omega_k\).
therefore, \(|13 - \omega_k|^2 = (13 - \omega_k)(13 - 1/\omega_k)\).
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>
<goal>
<outline>
2.1: expand the expression for |13 - ω_k|².
</outline>
<outline>
2.2: simplify the expanded expression.
</outline>
</goal>
<path>
2.1: expand that product: 13*13 - 13*(1/\omega_k) - 13*\(\omega_k\) + 1.
</path>
<path>
2.2: expand this: \(13 \times 13 - 13 \times 1/\omega_k - 13 \times \omega_k + 1\).
</path>
<conclusion>
the product (13 - ω_k)(13 - 1/ω_k) is expanded and then simplified.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
so, 169 - 13(\(\omega_k + 1/\omega_k\) ) + 1.
therefore, \(|13 - \omega_k|^2 = 170 - 13(\omega_k + 1/\omega_k)\).
but \(\omega_k + 1/\omega_k = 2\cos\theta_k\), where \(\theta_k = (1 + 2k)\pi/10\).
because \(e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta\).
therefore, \(|13 - \omega_k|^2 = 170 - 26\cos\theta_k\).
so, each term in the sum \(1/(r_i \overline{r}_i)\) is equal to \(170 - 26\cos\theta_k\).
wait, but the problem is asking for the sum over these terms for five pairs.
but the original equation is degree 10, so there are 10 roots, which are paired as complex conjugates.
therefore, the five terms correspond to five pairs of conjugate roots.
wait, but each \(\omega_k\) also comes in conjugate pairs.
let me check: for \(\omega_k = e^{(1 + 2k)\pi i/10}\), then \(\overline{\omega}_k = e^{- (1 + 2k)\pi i /10}\).
but is this equal to \(\omega_{10 - k}\)?
let's see: for k from 0 to 9, \(\omega_k = e^{(1 + 2k)\pi i/10}\).
then, \(\omega_{10 - k} = e^{(1 + 2(10 - k))\pi i /10} = e^{(1 + 20 - 2k)\pi i /10} = e^{(21 - 2k)\pi i /10} = e^{(1 - 2k)\pi i /10 + 2\pi i} = e^{(1 - 2k)\pi i /10}\).
which is \(e^{- (1 + 2k)\pi i /10}\) because \(1 - 2k = - (1 + 2k) + 2(k + 1)\), but actually, perhaps easier: e^{(21 - 2k)\pi i /10} = e^{(21\pi i - 2k\pi i)/10} = e^{(21\pi i)/10}e^{-2k\pi i/10} = but since e^{21\pi i/10} = e^{(20\pi i + \pi i)/10} = e^{2\pi i + \pi i/10} = e^{\pi i/10} (because e^{2\pi i} = 1).
wait, but e^{21\pi i /10} is equivalent to e^{\pi i /10} in angle, so actually, \(\omega_{10 - k} = e^{(21 - 2k)\pi i /10} = e^{(\pi i /10 + 2\pi i)} = e^{\pi i /10}\), but that might not capture the full angle.
wait, perhaps a different approach.
the angles for \(\omega_k\) are \(\pi/10, 3\pi/10, 5\pi/10, ..., up to 19\pi/10\).
wait, since k ranges from 0 to 9, (1 + 2k) ranges from 1 to 21, so (1 + 2k)\pi/10 ranges from \pi/10 (k=0) to 21\pi/10 (k=9).
but since angles are modulo 2π, 21\pi/10 is equivalent to 21\pi/10 - 2π = (21\pi - 20\pi)/10 = \pi/10.
wait, so actually, when k=10, if allowed, we would get back to \pi/10, but since k stops at 9, maybe it's better to represent each angle as ((1 + 2k) mod 20)\pi/10.
but maybe i need not go into that.
the point is, each \(\omega_k\) is a root of -1, so they are equally spaced on the unit circle at angles \(\pi/10, 3\pi/10, 5\pi/10,...,19\pi/10\).
so, for each \(\omega_k\), its conjugate is \(\omega_{k'}\) where k' is such that the angle is negative.
but since the angles are \(\theta_k = (1 + 2k)\pi/10\), then \(\overline{\omega}_k = e^{-i\theta_k} = e^{-i(1 + 2k)\pi/10}\).
this would correspond to \(\omega_{-k}\) if we allow negative k.
but since k ranges from 0 to 9, perhaps we can represent the conjugate as \(\omega_{10 - k}\).
let me check for k=0: \(\theta_0 = \pi/10\), so \(\overline{\omega}_0 = e^{-i\pi/10}\).
if k=5, \(\theta_5 = (1 + 10)\pi/10 = 11\pi/10\).
then \(\overline{\omega}_5 = e^{-11\pi i/10}\), which is equivalent to \(e^{\pi i/10}\) since -11π/10 + 2π = π/10.
but this is the same as \(\omega_0\).
wait, maybe there's a more straightforward way.
since the roots \(\omega_k\) are symmetric in the unit circle, each root has a conjugate root.
for polynomial equations with real coefficients, the roots come in conjugate pairs.
but the polynomial for \(\omega\) here is \(w^{10} + 1 = 0\), which has complex coefficients (since the constant term is 1, which is real, but the equation is satisfied by complex roots).
however, the original equation in x has real coefficients, so the roots x must come in complex conjugate pairs.
so, the roots \(x = 1/(13 - \omega_k)\) must come in conjugate pairs.
therefore, if \(x = 1/(13 - \omega_k)\) is a root, then so is its conjugate \(1/(13 - \overline{\omega}_k) = 1/(13 - 1/\omega_k)\), since \(\overline{\omega}_k = 1/\omega_k\) because \(|\omega_k|=1\).
but maybe we need to pair these roots.
alternatively, perhaps note that since \(\omega_k\) are roots of \(w^{10} + 1 = 0\), then each \(\omega_k\) satisfies \(\omega_k^{10} = -1\).
thus, the minimal polynomials over the reals would pair conjugate roots.
so, for each root \(\omega_k = e^{(1 + 2k)\pi i /10}\), its conjugate is \(\omega_{10 - k}\).
therefore, when we form the roots \(x = 1/(13 - \omega_k)\), the conjugate root is \(1/(13 - \overline{\omega}_k) = 1/(13 - 1/\omega_k)\).
but perhaps to pair them, we need to see when \(1/(13 - \omega_k)\) and \(1/(13 - 1/\omega_k)\) are roots.
let me check if \(1/(13 - \omega_k)\) and \(1/(13 - 1/\omega_k)\) are conjugates.
let me take the conjugate of \(1/(13 - \omega_k)\).
since 13 is real, and \(\overline{\omega}_k = 1/\omega_k\), we have:
\(\overline{(1/(13 - \omega_k))} = 1/(13 - \overline{\omega}_k) = 1/(13 - 1/\omega_k)\).
but \(1/(13 - 1/\omega_k) = \omega_k/(13\omega_k - 1)\).
however, if we consider the original equation \(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\), substituting \(x = \omega_k/(13\omega_k - 1)\), let's check if this satisfies the equation.
wait, perhaps not.
alternatively, note that if \(x = 1/(13 - \omega_k)\), then \(13x - 1 = (\omega_k)/(13 - \omega_k)\).
let's think in parallel.

</path>
<conclusion>
the expressions for x^10 and (13x - 1)^10 are derived.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
sum the two terms: \(1/(13 - \omega_k)^{10} + (\omega_k)^{10}/(13 - \omega_k)^{10} = [1 + (\omega_k)^{10}]/(13 - \omega_k)^{10}\).
but \(\omega_k^{10} = -1\), so numerator is 1 + (-1) = 0.
hence, the equation is satisfied.
so, \(x = 1/(13 - \omega_k)\) are indeed roots.
so, since each root \(x = 1/(13 - \omega_k)\) has a conjugate root \(1/(13 - 1/\omega_k)\), which can be written as \(\omega_k/(13\omega_k - 1)\).
but perhaps more importantly, the roots come in conjugate pairs, so when we sum \(1/(r_i \overline{r}_i)\) over the five pairs, each term is \(|13 - \omega_k|^2\).
therefore, the total sum is the sum over all distinct pairs (i.e., for each of the five pairs) of \(|13 - \omega_k|^2\).
but since each \(\omega_k\) is related to a unique root, but we need to make sure we're not double-counting.
since the roots \(\omega_k\) are symmetric, but each \(\omega_k\) is associated with a unique \(|13 - \omega_k|^2\).
however, since the problem specifies five pairs of roots, perhaps we need to sum over each unique pair once.
but actually, since all roots come in conjugate pairs, and the equation is degree 10, there are five such pairs.
therefore, the sum is over all \(|13 - \omega_k|^2\) for each unique \(\omega_k\) in one of the five pairs.
wait, but the roots \(\omega_k\) are from k = 0 to 9, but since they are symmetric, each pair of \(\omega_k\) and \(\overline{\omega}_k\) corresponds to a pair of roots in the original equation.
but given the way the problem is structured, with roots \(r_1, \overline{r}_1,...,r_5, \overline{r}_5\), then each pair \(r_i, \overline{r}_i\) corresponds to a pair of reciprocals related to some \(\omega_k\) and \(\overline{\omega}_k\).
but we can proceed as follows.
since each root \(r_i = 1/(13 - \omega_k)\), then \(1/(r_i \overline{r}_i) = |13 - \omega_k|^2\).
therefore, the sum is over all five pairs, so each distinct \(\omega_k\) (considering that conjugate roots would correspond to the same term?).
wait, no.
if \(r_i = 1/(13 - \omega_k)\), then \(\overline{r}_i = 1/(13 - \overline{\omega}_k)\).
then, \(1/(r_i \overline{r}_i) = (13 - \omega_k)(13 - \overline{\omega}_k) = |13 - \omega_k|^2\).
which is \(170 - 26\cos\theta_k\) as we found earlier.
therefore, since the roots \(\omega_k\) are at angles \(\theta_k = \pi/10, 3\pi/10, 5\pi/10, 7\pi/10, 9\pi/10, ..., 19\pi/10\), but since cosine is even, \(\cos(\theta) = \cos(-\theta) = \cos(2\pi - \theta)\).
therefore, for each angle \(\theta\), we have a pair of roots at \(\theta\) and \(2\pi - \theta\), which would have the same cosine value.
but since the original equation in x has real coefficients, the roots come in conjugate pairs, so for each root \(1/(13 - \omega_k)\), there is a conjugate root \(1/(13 - \overline{\omega}_k)\).
however, in terms of the sum over \(1/(r_i \overline{r}_i)\), each pair contributes a term which is \(|13 - \omega_k|^2\).
but because each pair is just two complex numbers whose product is \(|13 - \omega_k|^2\), we need to count each unique pair once.
but the problem specifies that the roots are given as five pairs of conjugates, so we need to compute the sum over the five pairs.
however, since each pair's contribution is \(|13 - \omega_k|^2 + |13 - \overline{\omega}_k|^2\), but wait, no.
wait, actually, each pair \(r_i, \overline{r}_i\) contributes only one term to the sum: \(1/(r_i \overline{r}_i)\).
but since \(r_i \overline{r}_i = |r_i|^2\), and \(1/(r_i \overline{r}_i) = 1/|r_i|^2\).
but previously, we saw that \(1/(r_i \overline{r}_i) = |13 - \omega_k|^2\).
so, for each root \(r_i = 1/(13 - \omega_k)\), its conjugate is \(\overline{r}_i = 1/(13 - \overline{\omega}_k)\).
then, the product \(r_i \overline{r}_i = [1/(13 - \omega_k)][1/(13 - \overline{\omega}_k)] = 1/|13 - \omega_k|^2\).
therefore, \(1/(r_i \overline{r}_i) = |13 - \omega_k|^2\).
so, each pair contributes \(|13 - \omega_k|^2\), but since \(\omega_k\) and \(\overline{\omega}_k\) are distinct (unless \(\omega_k\) is real), which in this case, the roots of -1 are on the unit circle.
the only real roots of \(w^{10} = -1\) are at \(\theta = \pi\) and \(\theta = 0\)?
wait, no, \(\theta = \pi\) is a root of \(w^{10} = 1\).
wait, the equation \(w^{10} = -1\) has roots at \(\theta = \pi/10 + 2k\pi/10\).
the real axis is at \(\theta = 0\) and \(\theta = \pi\).
so, to check if any of the roots \(\omega_k\) are real:
for \(\theta_k = \pi/10, 3\pi/10, 5\pi/10, 7\pi/10, 9\pi/10, 11\pi/10, 13\pi/10, 15\pi/10, 17\pi/10, 19\pi/10\).
the angles \(5\pi/10 = \pi/2\) and \(15\pi/10 = 3\pi/2\) are purely imaginary.
the angle \(10\pi/10 = \pi\) would be real, but that's \(w^{10} = -1\) which is \(\theta = \pi\), but \(\pi\) is already an angle for roots of unity for \(w^{10} = 1\) if n=10.
wait, no.
the roots of \(w^{10} = -1\) are at angles \(\theta = (\pi + 2k\pi)/10 + \pi/10\)?
wait, maybe i'm confusing.
actually, the roots of \(w^{10} = -1\) can be written as \(w = e^{(2k + 1)\pi i /10}\) for \(k = 0, 1, ..., 9\).
so, angles \(\pi/10, 3\pi/10, 5\pi/10, 7\pi/10, 9\pi/10, 11\pi/10, 13\pi/10, 15\pi/10, 17\pi/10, 19\pi/10\).
among these, the angles that are \(\pi\) radians (180 degrees) would make w = -1, but \(5\pi/10 = \pi/2\) and \(10\pi/10 = \pi\), but wait, in the list, the angles go up to 19\pi/10.
so, 5\pi/10 is \(\pi/2\), which is 90 degrees, leading to w being purely imaginary.
similarly, 10\pi/10 is \(\pi\), but that would be angle \(\pi\), but that is not included in the roots because (2k +1)\pi/10 for k from 0 to 9 gives odd multiples of \pi/10.
so, angle \(\pi\) is 10\pi/10, which would correspond to k = 9: (2*9 +1)\pi/10 = 19\pi/10.
so, none of the roots are real.
therefore, all roots \(\omega_k\) are non-real and come in conjugate pairs.
therefore, the roots \(1/(13 - \omega_k)\) also come in conjugate pairs.
therefore, the five pairs of roots in the problem correspond to five different \(\omega_k\) with their conjugates.
therefore, each distinct \(\omega_k\) with k = 0 to 4 would pair with k = 5 to 9, which are their conjugates.
therefore, the sum over the five terms \(|13 - \omega_k|^2\) for k = 0 to 4.
but each term for k and 10 -k would give the same cosine value because \(\cos(\theta_k) = \cos(-\theta_k) = \cos(\theta_{10 -k}))\).
wait, but since theta_k is (1 + 2k)pi/10, then theta_{10 -k} = (1 + 2*(10 -k))pi/10 = (21 - 2k)pi/10 = (21pi/10 - 2kpi/10) = equivalent angle to (21pi/10 - 2kpi/10 - 2pi) if that brings it within 0 to 2pi.
wait, 21pi/10 - 2pi = (21pi - 20pi)/10 = pi/10.
so, theta_{10 -k} = pi/10 + ( - 2kpi/10 ) + 2pi?
wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the cosine.
since theta_{10 -k} = (21 - 2k)pi/10.
then cos(theta_{10 -k}) = cos((21 - 2k)pi/10) = cos(2pi - (21 - 2k)pi/10) = cos(( -1)pi/10 + 2kpi/10) = cos(-pi/10 + 2kpi/10) = cos(pi/10 - 2kpi/10) = cos(theta_k - 2pi/10*(k)).
wait, maybe that's not helpful.
alternatively, because theta_{10 -k} = (21 -2k)pi/10 = (20pi/10 + (1 -2k)pi/10) = 2pi + (1 -2k)pi/10.
but cos is 2pi periodic, so cos(theta_{10 -k}) = cos((1 -2k)pi/10) = cos(- (1 + (-2k -1) +1 )).
wait, perhaps it's easier to note that theta_{10 -k} = (21 -2k)pi/10.
then, (21 -2k)pi/10 = (20pi/10 + (1 -2k)pi/10) = 2pi + (1 -2k)pi/10.
since cosine has period 2pi, cos(theta_{10 -k}) = cos((1 -2k)pi/10).
but (1 -2k)pi/10 is the negative of (2k -1)pi/10.
therefore, cos(theta_{10 -k}) = cos(-(2k -1)pi/10) = cos((2k -1)pi/10) = cos(theta_k).
therefore, cos(theta_{10 -k}) = cos(theta_k).
therefore, |13 - \omega_k|^2 = 170 -26cos(theta_k) and |13 - \omega_{10 -k}|^2 = 170 -26cos(theta_{10 -k}) = 170 -26cos(theta_k).
therefore, for each k, the pair (k, 10 -k) gives the same value of |13 - \omega|^2.
therefore, since the ten roots are paired as (k, 10 -k), each with the same |13 - \omega_k|^2.
but the problem says that the original equation's roots are given as five pairs of conjugates, so each unique pair contributes two roots with the same |13 - \omega|^2.
but in the sum, we only need to compute five terms, each equal to 170 -26cos(theta_k) for k = 0 to 4, or some other indexing.
wait, but the problem says the roots are r1, overline{r}1, etc.
so, each pair (r_i, overline{r}_i) corresponds to some (1/(13 - \omega_k), 1/(13 - \overline{\omega}_k)).
then, according to the problem, the sum is over five terms 1/(r_i overline{r}_i), each of which is |13 - \omega_k|^2.
but since each pair (r_i, overline{r}_i) corresponds to a specific \omega_k, and because of the cosine term, each unique \omega_k (up to conjugation) contributes once.
therefore, to compute the sum, we need to compute the sum over distinct cos(theta_k) for k from 0 to 4 (or any five indices which are not conjugate pairs).
wait, but maybe all ten roots can be grouped into five pairs, each with the same |13 - \omega_k|^2.
since theta_k and theta_{10 -k} have the same cosine, hence same |13 - \omega|^2.
therefore, the ten roots can be grouped into five pairs, each pair (k, 10 -k) with the same |13 - \omega|^2.
therefore, the sum over the five terms would be sum_{k=0}^4 (170 -26cos(theta_k))?
but since each pair (k,10 -k) gives the same value, but if we have five pairs, each corresponding to a unique k in 0 to 4, but actually, the angles for k from 0 to 9 are symmetric.
let's list them:
k=0: theta= pi/10 --> 18 degrees
k=1: 3pi/10 --> 54 degrees
k=2:5pi/10=pi/2 --> 90 degrees
k=3:7pi/10 --> 126 degrees
k=4:9pi/10 --> 162 degrees
k=5:11pi/10 --> 198 degrees
k=6:13pi/10 --> 234 degrees
k=7:15pi/10 --> 270 degrees
k=8:17pi/10 --> 306 degrees
k=9:19pi/10 --> 342 degrees
but angles over 180 degrees can be represented as negative angles:
11pi/10 = pi + pi/10 (angle 198 degrees = -162 degrees)
13pi/10 = pi + 3pi/10 (234 degrees = -126<conclusion>
