Okay, so I need to solve this equation: \(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\). It has 10 complex roots, which are given as conjugate pairs: \(r_1, \overline{r}_1, r_2, \overline{r}_2, r_3, \overline{r}_3, r_4, \overline{r}_4, r_5, \overline{r}_5\). The problem asks for the value of the sum \(\frac{1}{r_1\overline{r}_1} + \frac{1}{r_2\overline{r}_2} + \frac{1}{r_3\overline{r}_3} + \frac{1}{r_4\overline{r}_4} + \frac{1}{r_5\overline{r}_5}\).
First, let me recall that for any complex number \(r\), the product \(r \overline{r}\) is equal to the magnitude squared of \(r\), i.e., \(|r|^2\). So, each term \(\frac{1}{r_i \overline{r_i}}\) is actually \(\frac{1}{|r_i|^2}\). Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the sum of the reciprocals of the magnitudes squared of the roots. But maybe thinking in terms of the original equation will be helpful.
Let me start by analyzing the given equation: \(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\). This looks like a polynomial equation of degree 10. Since it's an equation of even degree, maybe there is some symmetry here. Let's see.
First, I can rewrite the equation as \(x^{10} = -(13x - 1)^{10}\). Taking the 10th roots of both sides, this would imply that \(x = e^{i\pi(2k+1)/10}(1 - 13x)\) for \(k = 0, 1, ..., 9\). Wait, but that might not necessarily be the easiest way to approach this.
Alternatively, perhaps make a substitution to simplify the equation. Let me set \(y = 13x - 1\). Then, \(x = \frac{y + 1}{13}\). Substituting this into the equation:
\[\left(\frac{y + 1}{13}\right)^{10} + y^{10} = 0\]
Multiply both sides by \(13^{10}\) to eliminate the denominator:
\[(y + 1)^{10} + 13^{10} y^{10} = 0\]
Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Maybe not. Let's try another approach.
The equation is \(x^{10} = -(13x - 1)^{10}\). If I divide both sides by \(x^{10}\), assuming \(x \neq 0\), which it probably isn't since all roots are non-zero (since if \(x = 0\), then \(0 + (-1)^{10} = 0 + 1 \neq 0\)), so all roots are non-zero.
Dividing by \(x^{10}\):
\[1 + \left(-\frac{13x - 1}{x}\right)^{10} = 0\]
Simplify the term inside the parentheses:
\[-\frac{13x - 1}{x} = -13 + \frac{1}{x}\]
Therefore, the equation becomes:
\[1 + \left(-13 + \frac{1}{x}\right)^{10} = 0\]
Let me set \(z = \frac{1}{x}\). Then, the equation becomes:
\[1 + (-13 + z)^{10} = 0\]
Which simplifies to:
\[(z - 13)^{10} = -1\]
Now, this seems more manageable. The equation \((z - 13)^{10} = -1\) is equivalent to finding the 10th roots of \(-1\). The roots of the equation \(w^{10} = -1\) are given by \(w = e^{i(\pi + 2k\pi)/10}\) for \(k = 0, 1, ..., 9\). Therefore, \(z - 13 = e^{i(\pi + 2k\pi)/10}\), so:
\[z = 13 + e^{i(\pi + 2k\pi)/10}\]
Recalling that \(z = \frac{1}{x}\), we have:
\[\frac{1}{x} = 13 + e^{i(\pi + 2k\pi)/10}\]
Therefore:
\[x = \frac{1}{13 + e^{i(\pi + 2k\pi)/10}}\]
Thus, each root \(r_k\) is given by this expression for \(k = 0, 1, ..., 9\). Now, we need to find the sum \(\sum_{k=1}^5 \frac{1}{r_k \overline{r_k}}\).
Since each root \(r_k\) is given as above, then \(r_k \overline{r_k} = |r_k|^2 = \left|\frac{1}{13 + e^{i(\pi + 2k\pi)/10}}\right|^2 = \frac{1}{|13 + e^{i(\pi + 2k\pi)/10}|^2}\). Therefore, \(\frac{1}{r_k \overline{r_k}} = |13 + e^{i(\pi + 2k\pi)/10}|^2\).
Therefore, the problem reduces to computing the sum of \(|13 + e^{i\theta_k}|^2\) over \(k = 0, 1, ..., 9\), but since the roots are given in conjugate pairs, and the answer is the sum over the first 5 terms (but since each \(r_k\) and \(\overline{r}_k\) would correspond to some \(k\) and their conjugate, but the modulus squared is the same for \(z\) and \(\overline{z}\). Wait, no: for each root \(r_k\) and its conjugate \(\overline{r}_k\), the terms \(\frac{1}{r_k \overline{r_k}}\) and \(\frac{1}{\overline{r}_k r_k}\) would be the same, since \(r_k \overline{r}_k = |r_k|^2\), so they are the same. But in the original problem, they only ask for 5 terms, but since the roots come in conjugate pairs, perhaps there are 5 pairs, so summing each once. But in the previous step, when considering all the roots, we have 10 roots, but since they are 5 pairs, and for each pair, \(r_k\) and \(\overline{r}_k\), but the question is summing over the 5 \(r_i\) where presumably each term is from a pair. But since the modulus squared is the same for each pair, maybe the answer is the same whether they take 5 terms or all 10? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says "the equation has 10 complex roots \(r_1, \overline{r}_1, r_2, \overline{r}_2, r_3, \overline{r}_3, r_4, \overline{r}_4, r_5, \overline{r}_5\)." Then the desired sum is over the 5 terms \(\frac{1}{r_1 \overline{r}_1} + \dots + \frac{1}{r_5 \overline{r}_5}\). But since each root and its conjugate both have the same modulus squared, so each pair contributes two identical terms? Wait, but no. Each pair \(r_k, \overline{r}_k\) would have the same modulus squared. So if the equation has roots which are conjugate pairs, then each pair contributes two roots with the same \(|r_k|^2\). Therefore, when we take the reciprocals of the modulus squared, each pair contributes two identical terms. But the problem is stating that they list the roots as \(r_1, \overline{r}_1, ..., r_5, \overline{r}_5\), so there are 5 such pairs. Therefore, the sum in question is over one from each pair, but since both \(r_k\) and \(\overline{r}_k\) contribute the same value \(\frac{1}{|r_k|^2} = \frac{1}{| \overline{r}_k |^2}\), so whether we sum over \(r_1, ..., r_5\) or their conjugates, the sum is the same.
But maybe to compute this sum, instead of dealing with the roots one by one, we can use properties of polynomials and Vieta's formula. Let me think.
But first, let's recall that we transformed the equation into \(x = \frac{1}{13 + e^{i(\pi + 2k\pi)/10}}\), so each root is \(x_k = \frac{1}{13 + e^{i(\pi + 2k\pi)/10}}\). Then, \(|x_k|^2 = \frac{1}{|13 + e^{i(\pi + 2k\pi)/10}|^2}\), so \(\frac{1}{|x_k|^2} = |13 + e^{i(\pi + 2k\pi)/10}|^2\). Therefore, the desired sum is the sum over \(k = 0\) to \(4\) (but since there are 10 roots, why 4? Wait, the original problem states that there are 5 pairs, so maybe k ranges over 0 to 9, but since they are grouped into 5 pairs. Wait, but for each k from 0 to 9, we have 10 roots, but since the equation is of degree 10. However, the problem says there are 5 pairs, so perhaps each pair corresponds to some k and its conjugate. So for each k, the roots \(x_k\) and \(x_{k+5}\) might be conjugates? Let's check.
If \(k\) ranges from 0 to 9, and the angle is \(\pi + 2k\pi/10\). For \(k\) and \(k + 5\), the angle would differ by \(\pi\). So \(\theta_{k+5} = \pi + 2(k + 5)\pi/10 = \pi + 2k\pi/10 + \pi = 2\pi + 2k\pi/10\). But since angles are modulo \(2\pi\), \(\theta_{k+5} \equiv 2k\pi/10 \pmod{2\pi}\). Wait, but then \(e^{i\theta_{k+5}} = e^{i 2k\pi/10}\). But the original exponent was \(e^{i(\pi + 2k\pi/10)}\). The conjugate of \(e^{i(\pi + 2k\pi/10)}\) is \(e^{-i(\pi + 2k\pi/10)}\). Let's check if for some k, \(e^{i(\pi + 2k\pi/10)}\) and \(e^{-i(\pi + 2k'\pi/10)}\) correspond. Hmm, maybe not straightforward.
Alternatively, consider that for each root \(x_k = \frac{1}{13 + e^{i(\pi + 2k\pi/10)}}\), its conjugate is \(\overline{x_k} = \frac{1}{13 + e^{-i(\pi + 2k\pi/10)}}\). But does \(e^{-i(\pi + 2k\pi/10)}\) correspond to some \(e^{i(\pi + 2k'\pi/10)}\)? Let's solve:
\[-(\pi + 2k\pi/10) \equiv \pi + 2k'\pi/10 \pmod{2\pi}\]
Which gives:
\[-\pi - 2k\pi/10 \equiv \pi + 2k'\pi/10 \pmod{2\pi}\]
\[-2k\pi/10 - 2\pi \equiv 2k'\pi/10 \pmod{2\pi}\]
Divide both sides by \(2\pi\):
\[-k/10 - 1 \equiv k'/10 \pmod{1}\)
So:
\[-k/10 -1 = k'/10 + n\), where n is an integer.
Then:
\[-k -10 = k' + 10n\)
Thus:
\(k' = -k -10 -10n\)
But since k' must be between 0 and 9, this may not be straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps considering that the exponents are at angles which are symmetric around the unit circle. Alternatively, maybe the roots \(x_k\) and \(x_{k+5}\) (with indices modulo 10) are conjugates. Let me check.
If \(k' = k + 5\), then the angle is \(\pi + 2(k +5)\pi/10 = \pi + 2k\pi/10 + \pi = 2\pi + 2k\pi/10 \equiv 2k\pi/10 \pmod{2\pi}\). Therefore, \(e^{i\theta_{k+5}} = e^{i 2k\pi/10}\). But notice that:
\(e^{i\theta_{k+5}} = e^{i 2k\pi/10} = \overline{e^{-i 2k\pi/10}}\). Wait, not sure.
Alternatively, let's compute \(\overline{x_k}\):
\(\overline{x_k} = \frac{1}{13 + e^{-i(\pi + 2k\pi/10)}}\). Let’s compute the denominator:
\(13 + e^{-i(\pi + 2k\pi/10)} = 13 + e^{-i\pi} e^{-i2k\pi/10} = 13 + (-1) e^{-i2k\pi/10} = 13 - e^{-i2k\pi/10}\).
But compare this with \(x_{k'} = \frac{1}{13 + e^{i(\pi + 2k'\pi/10)}}\). For which k' is \(13 + e^{i(\pi + 2k'\pi/10)} = 13 - e^{-i2k\pi/10}\)? Let's solve:
\(e^{i(\pi + 2k'\pi/10)} = - e^{-i2k\pi/10}\)
Which implies:
\(e^{i(\pi + 2k'\pi/10 + 2k\pi/10)} = 1\)
Wait, perhaps another approach. Let’s set:
\(e^{i(\pi + 2k'\pi/10)} = - e^{-i2k\pi/10}\)
Multiply both sides by -1:
\(-e^{i(\pi + 2k'\pi/10)} = e^{-i2k\pi/10}\)
Which implies:
\(e^{i(\pi + 2k'\pi/10 + \pi)} = e^{-i2k\pi/10}\)
Because multiplying by -1 is equivalent to adding \(\pi\) to the exponent. So:
\(e^{i(2\pi + 2k'\pi/10)} = e^{-i2k\pi/10}\)
But \(2\pi\) can be dropped modulo \(2\pi\), so:
\(e^{i(2k'\pi/10)} = e^{-i2k\pi/10}\)
Therefore:
\(2k'\pi/10 \equiv -2k\pi/10 \pmod{2\pi}\)
Divide through by \(2\pi/10\):
\(k' \equiv -k \pmod{10}\)
Therefore, \(k' = 10 - k\). So, if \(k' = 10 - k\), then the exponent becomes \(e^{i(\pi + 2(10 - k)\pi/10)} = e^{i(\pi + 2\pi - 2k\pi/10)} = e^{i(3\pi - 2k\pi/10)}\). But then:
\(e^{i3\pi} = e^{i\pi} = -1\), so:
\(e^{i(3\pi - 2k\pi/10)} = - e^{-i2k\pi/10}\), which is the same as \(- e^{-i2k\pi/10}\). Wait, but this seems different.
Wait, perhaps it's simpler to note that if \(k' = 10 - k\), then:
Denominator for \(x_{k'} = 13 + e^{i(\pi + 2(10 - k)\pi/10)} = 13 + e^{i(\pi + 2\pi - 2k\pi/10)} = 13 + e^{i(3\pi - 2k\pi/10)}\)
But \(e^{i(3\pi - 2k\pi/10)} = e^{i(\pi - 2k\pi/10 + 2\pi)} = e^{i(\pi - 2k\pi/10)}\), which is equivalent to \(e^{i\pi} e^{-i2k\pi/10} = - e^{-i2k\pi/10}\).
Therefore, denominator is \(13 - e^{-i2k\pi/10}\), which is exactly the denominator in \(\overline{x_k}\). Therefore, \(x_{k'} = x_{10 - k} = \frac{1}{13 - e^{-i2k\pi/10}} = \overline{x_k}\). Hence, the roots \(x_k\) and \(x_{10 -k}\) are conjugate pairs. But since k ranges from 0 to 9, then indeed each \(x_k\) for k from 0 to 4 has a conjugate \(x_{10 -k}\) which is \(x_{k'}\) where \(k' = 10 -k\), and since 10 -k would be from 10 -0 =10, but k=0 to 9, so when k=0, 10 -0 =10, but indices modulo 10? Wait, no. Wait, when k=0, x_0 is 1/(13 + e^{i\pi}) = 1/(13 + (-1)) = 1/12. Then, x_{10 -0}=x_{10}=x_0 since 10 mod 10=0. Wait, but k=0 to 9, so x_10 is not defined, x_9 is the last one. Wait, perhaps my prior reasoning is incorrect.
Wait, if k=0, then x_0 = 1/(13 + e^{i\pi}) = 1/(13 -1) = 1/12. Then, the conjugate of x_0 is 1/12, which is x_0 itself. So x_0 is real. Similarly, for k=5, angle is \(\pi + 2*5*\pi/10 = \pi + \pi = 2\pi\), so e^{i2\pi}=1, so x_5=1/(13 +1)=1/14. So x_5 is real. Therefore, the roots x_0 and x_5 are real, and the other roots come in conjugate pairs. But the problem states that all roots are given as pairs \(r_1, \overline{r}_1, ..., r_5, \overline{r}_5\). But according to this, there are two real roots (x_0 and x_5) and four pairs of complex roots. But real roots are their own conjugates, which contradicts the problem's statement that the roots are given as conjugate pairs \(r_1, \overline{r}_1,...,r_5, \overline{r}_5\). Therefore, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.
Wait, perhaps the equation has 10 roots which are 5 pairs of conjugates. But when we considered the roots x_k =1/(13 + e^{i(\pi + 2k\pi/10)}), for k=0,...,9, but as we saw, x_0 is real, x_5 is real, and the rest for k=1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9 come as conjugate pairs. Therefore, the roots are: x_0 (real), x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5 (real), x_6, x_7, x_8, x_9. But x_6 is conjugate of x_4, etc. So in total, two real roots and four complex conjugate pairs.
However, the problem states that the equation has 10 complex roots given as conjugate pairs, i.e., five pairs. But according to our analysis, two of the roots are real, so perhaps there is a mistake here.
Wait, but the problem says "The equation \(x^{10} + (13x -1)^{10}=0\) has 10 complex roots \(r_1, \overline{r}_1, ..., r_5, \overline{r}_5\)." But if all roots are complex and come in conjugate pairs, then the polynomial must have real coefficients, which it does. However, in our analysis, we found two real roots. But real numbers can be considered as complex numbers with zero imaginary part. So maybe the problem is using "complex" in the sense of "in the complex plane" (i.e., allowing real or complex), and stating that they come in five conjugate pairs, where some pairs may be real (i.e., the real roots are paired with themselves). However, Vieta's formula would still apply. But perhaps the problem-writer considers complex roots to include real roots, and since real roots can be paired with themselves, you can have five pairs. But x0=1/12 and x5=1/14 are distinct real roots, so to pair them as conjugate pairs, but they are separate. So this seems contradictory.
Wait, perhaps my substitution missed something. Let me check again.
Starting from \(x^{10} + (13x -1)^{10}=0\). Then I set z=1/x, and obtained (z−13)^10 = -1. So solving for z gives z=13 + e^{i(π + 2kπ)/10}, k=0,...,9. Then x=1/z = 1/(13 + e^{i(π + 2kπ)/10}). For k=0, angle π, which is -1, so x=1/(13-1)=1/12. For k=5, angle π + π = 2π, which is 1, so x=1/(13 +1)=1/14. So indeed, two real roots. So perhaps the problem's statement that the roots are given as conjugate pairs is a misstatement, but in reality, there are two real roots and four complex conjugate pairs.
But the problem says "10 complex roots", which might be considered as 10 roots in the complex plane, some real, some complex. But in any case, the user wants the sum of 1/(r_i \overline{r_i}) for five pairs. But they might consider the real roots as their own conjugate pairs. So x0 and x5 are their own conjugates (since they are real), and the sum would include 1/(x0^2) + 1/(x5^2) + sums over the four pairs of complex roots. But the problem states that the roots are r1, \overline{r1},..., r5, \overline{r5}, which would imply 10 distinct roots. But in our case, if two roots are real, then they must be counted once, but the problem counts them as pairs, which would imply that perhaps the problem's statement is incorrect, or maybe my analysis is missing something.
Wait, but in the equation \(x^{10} + (13x -1)^{10}=0\), maybe there's a transformation that shows that all roots actually come in complex conjugate pairs even if they look like they might have real roots. Wait, but in our substitution, the roots are x=1/(13 + e^{iθ}), where θ is (π + 2kπ/10). So when k=0, θ=π, so e^{iθ}=-1}, so x=1/(13-1)=1/12. Similarly, k=5 gives θ=π + π=2π, e^{i2π}=1, so x=1/(13+1)=1/14. So indeed, two real roots. Therefore, in that case, the problem statement might be incorrect in saying that the roots are given as five conjugate pairs, since there are two real roots and four complex conjugate pairs.
But perhaps in the problem statement, they grouped the real roots as two separate roots, and then the complex conjugate pairs, but labeled them in total as five pairs, treating the real roots as pairs with themselves. That is, r1=\overline{r1}=x0, r2, \overline{r2},..., r5=\overline{r5}=x5. But in that case, then the sum would be over 1/(x0^2) + 1/(x5^2) + the four terms for the complex pairs. But in our case, for real roots, since x is real, 1/(x \overline{x}) is just 1/x^2. So for the real roots x0=1/12 and x5=1/14, their 1/(x0^2) = 144, 1/(x5^2)=196. Then for the complex roots, each pair would contribute two terms which are the same (since for each complex root r, \overline{r}, we have 1/(r \overline{r}) = 1/|r|^2, and similarly for \overline{r}). So when the problem says "r1, \overline{r1},...", if they list each complex root and its conjugate as separate roots, but in the sum they just take r1, r2, r3, r4, r5, then depending on how they index them. But given that the equation has two real roots and four complex conjugate pairs, the 10 roots are: 1/12, 1/14, (a + bi), (a - bi), (c + di), (c - di), etc. So if the problem lists them as r1=\overline{r1} (1/12), r2, \overline{r2} (the pair (a+bi), (a -bi)), r3, \overline{r3}, etc., then r5 would be \overline{r5} (1/14). But in any case, the sum would be 1/(1/12^2) + 1/(1/14^2) + sum over the four |r_k|^2. Wait, no. Wait, if r1 is 1/12, then 1/(r1 \overline{r1}) = 1/( (1/12)(1/12) ) = 144. Similarly, 1/(r5 \overline{r5}) = 196. Then, the other terms, for each complex pair (r_k, \overline{r}_k), 1/(r_k \overline{r}_k) = 1/|r_k|^2, and since r_k and \overline{r}_k would have the same modulus, so each pair contributes two terms which are same in the original sum. But the problem says "the equation has ... r1, \overline{r}_1, ..., r5, \overline{r5}", which would imply that there are 10 roots: r1, conj(r1), r2, conj(r2), etc. So if there are five pairs, then two of the pairs are real numbers (i.e., r1=conj(r1), etc.), but in our case, two roots are real, so there's a contradiction here.
Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended all roots to be complex (non-real), and thus in conjugate pairs. But in reality, our analysis shows two real roots. Therefore, perhaps there's an error in the problem statement.
But, stepping back, maybe the key is to compute the desired sum \(\sum_{k=0}^{9} \frac{1}{|x_k|^2}\), but since the problem only asks for the sum over one from each pair (but since the problem lists the roots as r1, \overline{r1},..., it's ambiguous). But given that the customer specifies the roots as 5 pairs, even though in reality there are two real roots and four complex pairs, perhaps they consider the two real roots as two separate pairs. So r1=1/12, \overline{r1}=1/12 (same as r1), r2, \overline{r2},..., r5=1/14, \overline{r5}=1/14. Then the sum would be 1/( (1/12)^2 ) + 1/( (1/14)^2 ) + sum over the four pairs 1/( |r_i|^2 ). But in our case, the sum would be 144 + 196 + sum over the four pairs. But each complex root x_k has |x_k|^2=1/|13 + e^{iθ_k}|^2, so 1/|x_k|^2=|13 + e^{iθ_k}}|^2. Each pair of complex conjugate roots would correspond to angles θ and θ + π? Wait, no. Wait, the complex roots come in conjugate pairs, which in terms of the exponents: For each complex root x_k, their conjugate x_{k'}= \overline{x_k} corresponds to the exponent θ_{k'}= -θ_k + 2πm. But in our parametrization, θ_k = π + 2kπ/10. So the conjugate exponent would be -θ_k + 2πm. Let me check: For x_k=1/(13 + e^{iθ_k}), its conjugate is 1/(13 + e^{-iθ_k}). For which k' is θ_{k'} = -θ_k + 2πm? Let's see. Suppose θ_{k} = π + 2kπ/10. Then θ_{k'} = π + 2k'π/10 = -θ_k + 2πm. So: π + 2k'π/10 = -π - 2kπ/10 + 2πm. Then: 2k'π/10 = -2π - 2kπ/10 + 2πm. Divide by 2π: k'/5 = -1 -k/10 + m. Multiply by 10: 2k' = -10 -k +10m. Thus: 2k' +k = -10 +10m. But this seems not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps for each k from 1 to 4, there exists a k' such that θ_{k'}= -θ_k + 2π. Let's see: θ_k=π + 2kπ/10. Then, -θ_k + 2π= -π -2kπ/10 + 2π= π - 2kπ/10. So we need θ_{k'}= π - 2kπ/10. Let's solve for k': π + 2k'π/10 = π - 2kπ/10 => 2k'π/10 = -2kπ/10 => k'= -k. Since k is from 1 to 4, then k' would be -1, -2, -3, -4. But indices are modulo 10, so k'=9,8,7,6. Therefore, for k=1, the conjugate exponent is θ_9=π + 2*9π/10=π + 18π/10=π(1 + 18/10)=π(28/10)=π(14/5). But θ_{k'}=π - 2kπ/10=π - 2*1π/10=π(1 - 1/5)=π(4/5). But 14π/5 is equivalent to 14π/5 - 2π= (14π -10π)/5=4π/5. So θ_9=4π/5, which is equivalent to θ_{k} when k= something. Wait, but θ_{k'}=4π/5. Let's check if θ_{k'}=π - 2kπ/10=π - 2π/10=13π/15? Wait, no. Wait, θ_{k'}=π - 2kπ/10. For k=1, θ_{k'}=π - π/5=4π/5=14π/10. But since angles are modulo 2π, 14π/10=7π/5. Wait, but 14π/10=7π/5=126 degrees, which is in the third quadrant. Wait, but θ_9=π + 2*9π/10=π + 18π/10=28π/10=14π/5=2π + 4π/5. So θ_9 is equivalent to 4π/5. But 4π/5 is in the second quadrant, while 14π/5 is in the fourth quadrant. Wait, but 4π/5 and 14π/5 are separated by π. Wait, 4π/5=π - π/5, and 14π/5=2π - π/5. So exponents e^{i4π/5} and e^{i14π/5}=e^{-iπ/5} are different. But x_k for k=1 uses angle θ=π + 2*1π/10=π + 2π/10=12π/10=6π/5. Wait, hold on: Wait, original equation had roots x_k=1/(13 + e^{i(π + 2kπ/10)}). So for k=1, θ

okay, so i need to solve this equation: \(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\). it has 10 complex roots, which are given as conjugate pairs: \(r_1, \overline{r}_1, r_2, \overline{r}_2, r_3, \overline{r}_3, r_4, \overline{r}_4, r_5, \overline{r}_5\). the problem asks for the value of the sum \(\frac{1}{r_1\overline{r}_1} + \frac{1}{r_2\overline{r}_2} + \frac{1}{r_3\overline{r}_3} + \frac{1}{r_4\overline{r}_4} + \frac{1}{r_5\overline{r}_5}\).
first, let me recall that for any complex number \(r\), the product \(r \overline{r}\) is equal to the magnitude squared of \(r\), i.e., \(|r|^2\). so, each term \(\frac{1}{r_i \overline{r_i}}\) is actually \(\frac{1}{|r_i|^2}\). therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the sum of the reciprocals of the magnitudes squared of the roots. but maybe thinking in terms of the original equation will be helpful.
let me start by analyzing the given equation: \(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\). this looks like a polynomial equation of degree 10. since it's an equation of even degree, maybe there is some symmetry here. let's see.
first, i can rewrite the equation as \(x^{10} = -(13x - 1)^{10}\). taking the 10th roots of both sides, this would imply that \(x = e^{i\pi(2k+1)/10}(1 - 13x)\) for \(k = 0, 1, ..., 9\). wait, but that might not necessarily be the easiest way to approach this.
alternatively, perhaps make a substitution to simplify the equation. let me set \(y = 13x - 1\). then, \(x = \frac{y + 1}{13}\). substituting this into the equation:
\[\left(\frac{y + 1}{13}\right)^{10} + y^{10} = 0\]
multiply both sides by \(13^{10}\) to eliminate the denominator:
\[(y + 1)^{10} + 13^{10} y^{10} = 0\]
hmm, not sure if that's helpful. maybe not. let's try another approach.
the equation is \(x^{10} = -(13x - 1)^{10}\). if i divide both sides by \(x^{10}\), assuming \(x \neq 0\), which it probably isn't since all roots are non-zero (since if \(x = 0\), then \(0 + (-1)^{10} = 0 + 1 \neq 0\)), so all roots are non-zero.
dividing by \(x^{10}\):
\[1 + \left(-\frac{13x - 1}{x}\right)^{10} = 0\]
simplify the term inside the parentheses:
\[-\frac{13x - 1}{x} = -13 + \frac{1}{x}\]
therefore, the equation becomes:
\[1 + \left(-13 + \frac{1}{x}\right)^{10} = 0\]
let me set \(z = \frac{1}{x}\). then, the equation becomes:
\[1 + (-13 + z)^{10} = 0\]
which simplifies to:
\[(z - 13)^{10} = -1\]
now, this seems more manageable. the equation \((z - 13)^{10} = -1\) is equivalent to finding the 10th roots of \(-1\). the roots of the equation \(w^{10} = -1\) are given by \(w = e^{i(\pi + 2k\pi)/10}\) for \(k = 0, 1, ..., 9\). therefore, \(z - 13 = e^{i(\pi + 2k\pi)/10}\), so:
\[z = 13 + e^{i(\pi + 2k\pi)/10}\]
recalling that \(z = \frac{1}{x}\), we have:
\[\frac{1}{x} = 13 + e^{i(\pi + 2k\pi)/10}\]
therefore:
\[x = \frac{1}{13 + e^{i(\pi + 2k\pi)/10}}\]
thus, each root \(r_k\) is given by this expression for \(k = 0, 1, ..., 9\). now, we need to find the sum \(\sum_{k=1}^5 \frac{1}{r_k \overline{r_k}}\).
since each root \(r_k\) is given as above, then \(r_k \overline{r_k} = |r_k|^2 = \left|\frac{1}{13 + e^{i(\pi + 2k\pi)/10}}\right|^2 = \frac{1}{|13 + e^{i(\pi + 2k\pi)/10}|^2}\). therefore, \(\frac{1}{r_k \overline{r_k}} = |13 + e^{i(\pi + 2k\pi)/10}|^2\).
therefore, the problem reduces to computing the sum of \(|13 + e^{i\theta_k}|^2\) over \(k = 0, 1, ..., 9\), but since the roots are given in conjugate pairs, and the answer is the sum over the first 5 terms (but since each \(r_k\) and \(\overline{r}_k\) would correspond to some \(k\) and their conjugate, but the modulus squared is the same for \(z\) and \(\overline{z}\). wait, no: for each root \(r_k\) and its conjugate \(\overline{r}_k\), the terms \(\frac{1}{r_k \overline{r_k}}\) and \(\frac{1}{\overline{r}_k r_k}\) would be the same, since \(r_k \overline{r}_k = |r_k|^2\), so they are the same. but in the original problem, they only ask for 5 terms, but since the roots come in conjugate pairs, perhaps there are 5 pairs, so summing each once. but in the previous step, when considering all the roots, we have 10 roots, but since they are 5 pairs, and for each pair, \(r_k\) and \(\overline{r}_k\), but the question is summing over the 5 \(r_i\) where presumably each term is from a pair. but since the modulus squared is the same for each pair, maybe the answer is the same whether they take 5 terms or all 10? wait, no. wait, the problem says "the equation has 10 complex roots \(r_1, \overline{r}_1, r_2, \overline{r}_2, r_3, \overline{r}_3, r_4, \overline{r}_4, r_5, \overline{r}_5\)." then the desired sum is over the 5 terms \(\frac{1}{r_1 \overline{r}_1} + \dots + \frac{1}{r_5 \overline{r}_5}\). but since each root and its conjugate both have the same modulus squared, so each pair contributes two identical terms? wait, but no. each pair \(r_k, \overline{r}_k\) would have the same modulus squared. so if the equation has roots which are conjugate pairs, then each pair contributes two roots with the same \(|r_k|^2\). therefore, when we take the reciprocals of the modulus squared, each pair contributes two identical terms. but the problem is stating that they list the roots as \(r_1, \overline{r}_1, ..., r_5, \overline{r}_5\), so there are 5 such pairs. therefore, the sum in question is over one from each pair, but since both \(r_k\) and \(\overline{r}_k\) contribute the same value \(\frac{1}{|r_k|^2} = \frac{1}{| \overline{r}_k |^2}\), so whether we sum over \(r_1, ..., r_5\) or their conjugates, the sum is the same.
but maybe to compute this sum, instead of dealing with the roots one by one, we can use properties of polynomials and vieta's formula. let me think.
but first, let's recall that we transformed the equation into \(x = \frac{1}{13 + e^{i(\pi + 2k\pi)/10}}\), so each root is \(x_k = \frac{1}{13 + e^{i(\pi + 2k\pi)/10}}\). then, \(|x_k|^2 = \frac{1}{|13 + e^{i(\pi + 2k\pi)/10}|^2}\), so \(\frac{1}{|x_k|^2} = |13 + e^{i(\pi + 2k\pi)/10}|^2\). therefore, the desired sum is the sum over \(k = 0\) to \(4\) (but since there are 10 roots, why 4? wait, the original problem states that there are 5 pairs, so maybe k ranges over 0 to 9, but since they are grouped into 5 pairs. wait, but for each k from 0 to 9, we have 10 roots, but since the equation is of degree 10. however, the problem says there are 5 pairs, so perhaps each pair corresponds to some k and its conjugate. so for each k, the roots \(x_k\) and \(x_{k+5}\) might be conjugates? let's check.
if \(k\) ranges from 0 to 9, and the angle is \(\pi + 2k\pi/10\). for \(k\) and \(k + 5\), the angle would differ by \(\pi\). so \(\theta_{k+5} = \pi + 2(k + 5)\pi/10 = \pi + 2k\pi/10 + \pi = 2\pi + 2k\pi/10\). but since angles are modulo \(2\pi\), \(\theta_{k+5} \equiv 2k\pi/10 \pmod{2\pi}\). wait, but then \(e^{i\theta_{k+5}} = e^{i 2k\pi/10}\). but the original exponent was \(e^{i(\pi + 2k\pi/10)}\). the conjugate of \(e^{i(\pi + 2k\pi/10)}\) is \(e^{-i(\pi + 2k\pi/10)}\). let's check if for some k, \(e^{i(\pi + 2k\pi/10)}\) and \(e^{-i(\pi + 2k'\pi/10)}\) correspond. hmm, maybe not straightforward.
alternatively, consider that for each root \(x_k = \frac{1}{13 + e^{i(\pi + 2k\pi/10)}}\), its conjugate is \(\overline{x_k} = \frac{1}{13 + e^{-i(\pi + 2k\pi/10)}}\). but does \(e^{-i(\pi + 2k\pi/10)}\) correspond to some \(e^{i(\pi + 2k'\pi/10)}\)? let's solve:
\[-(\pi + 2k\pi/10) \equiv \pi + 2k'\pi/10 \pmod{2\pi}\]
which gives:
\[-\pi - 2k\pi/10 \equiv \pi + 2k'\pi/10 \pmod{2\pi}\]
\[-2k\pi/10 - 2\pi \equiv 2k'\pi/10 \pmod{2\pi}\]
divide both sides by \(2\pi\):
\[-k/10 - 1 \equiv k'/10 \pmod{1}\)
so:
\[-k/10 -1 = k'/10 + n\), where n is an integer.
then:
\[-k -10 = k' + 10n\)
thus:
\(k' = -k -10 -10n\)
but since k' must be between 0 and 9, this may not be straightforward. alternatively, perhaps considering that the exponents are at angles which are symmetric around the unit circle. alternatively, maybe the roots \(x_k\) and \(x_{k+5}\) (with indices modulo 10) are conjugates. let me check.
if \(k' = k + 5\), then the angle is \(\pi + 2(k +5)\pi/10 = \pi + 2k\pi/10 + \pi = 2\pi + 2k\pi/10 \equiv 2k\pi/10 \pmod{2\pi}\). therefore, \(e^{i\theta_{k+5}} = e^{i 2k\pi/10}\). but notice that:
\(e^{i\theta_{k+5}} = e^{i 2k\pi/10} = \overline{e^{-i 2k\pi/10}}\). wait, not sure.
alternatively, let's compute \(\overline{x_k}\):
\(\overline{x_k} = \frac{1}{13 + e^{-i(\pi + 2k\pi/10)}}\). let’s compute the denominator:
\(13 + e^{-i(\pi + 2k\pi/10)} = 13 + e^{-i\pi} e^{-i2k\pi/10} = 13 + (-1) e^{-i2k\pi/10} = 13 - e^{-i2k\pi/10}\).
but compare this with \(x_{k'} = \frac{1}{13 + e^{i(\pi + 2k'\pi/10)}}\). for which k' is \(13 + e^{i(\pi + 2k'\pi/10)} = 13 - e^{-i2k\pi/10}\)? let's solve:
\(e^{i(\pi + 2k'\pi/10)} = - e^{-i2k\pi/10}\)
which implies:
\(e^{i(\pi + 2k'\pi/10 + 2k\pi/10)} = 1\)
wait, perhaps another approach. let’s set:
\(e^{i(\pi + 2k'\pi/10)} = - e^{-i2k\pi/10}\)
multiply both sides by -1:
\(-e^{i(\pi + 2k'\pi/10)} = e^{-i2k\pi/10}\)
which implies:
\(e^{i(\pi + 2k'\pi/10 + \pi)} = e^{-i2k\pi/10}\)
because multiplying by -1 is equivalent to adding \(\pi\) to the exponent. so:
\(e^{i(2\pi + 2k'\pi/10)} = e^{-i2k\pi/10}\)
but \(2\pi\) can be dropped modulo \(2\pi\), so:
\(e^{i(2k'\pi/10)} = e^{-i2k\pi/10}\)
therefore:
\(2k'\pi/10 \equiv -2k\pi/10 \pmod{2\pi}\)
divide through by \(2\pi/10\):
\(k' \equiv -k \pmod{10}\)
therefore, \(k' = 10 - k\). so, if \(k' = 10 - k\), then the exponent becomes \(e^{i(\pi + 2(10 - k)\pi/10)} = e^{i(\pi + 2\pi - 2k\pi/10)} = e^{i(3\pi - 2k\pi/10)}\). but then:
\(e^{i3\pi} = e^{i\pi} = -1\), so:
\(e^{i(3\pi - 2k\pi/10)} = - e^{-i2k\pi/10}\), which is the same as \(- e^{-i2k\pi/10}\). wait, but this seems different.
wait, perhaps it's simpler to note that if \(k' = 10 - k\), then:
denominator for \(x_{k'} = 13 + e^{i(\pi + 2(10 - k)\pi/10)} = 13 + e^{i(\pi + 2\pi - 2k\pi/10)} = 13 + e^{i(3\pi - 2k\pi/10)}\)
but \(e^{i(3\pi - 2k\pi/10)} = e^{i(\pi - 2k\pi/10 + 2\pi)} = e^{i(\pi - 2k\pi/10)}\), which is equivalent to \(e^{i\pi} e^{-i2k\pi/10} = - e^{-i2k\pi/10}\).
therefore, denominator is \(13 - e^{-i2k\pi/10}\), which is exactly the denominator in \(\overline{x_k}\). therefore, \(x_{k'} = x_{10 - k} = \frac{1}{13 - e^{-i2k\pi/10}} = \overline{x_k}\). hence, the roots \(x_k\) and \(x_{10 -k}\) are conjugate pairs. but since k ranges from 0 to 9, then indeed each \(x_k\) for k from 0 to 4 has a conjugate \(x_{10 -k}\) which is \(x_{k'}\) where \(k' = 10 -k\), and since 10 -k would be from 10 -0 =10, but k=0 to 9, so when k=0, 10 -0 =10, but indices modulo 10? wait, no. wait, when k=0, x_0 is 1/(13 + e^{i\pi}) = 1/(13 + (-1)) = 1/12. then, x_{10 -0}=x_{10}=x_0 since 10 mod 10=0. wait, but k=0 to 9, so x_10 is not defined, x_9 is the last one. wait, perhaps my prior reasoning is incorrect.
wait, if k=0, then x_0 = 1/(13 + e^{i\pi}) = 1/(13 -1) = 1/12. then, the conjugate of x_0 is 1/12, which is x_0 itself. so x_0 is real. similarly, for k=5, angle is \(\pi + 2*5*\pi/10 = \pi + \pi = 2\pi\), so e^{i2\pi}=1, so x_5=1/(13 +1)=1/14. so x_5 is real. therefore, the roots x_0 and x_5 are real, and the other roots come in conjugate pairs. but the problem states that all roots are given as pairs \(r_1, \overline{r}_1, ..., r_5, \overline{r}_5\). but according to this, there are two real roots (x_0 and x_5) and four pairs of complex roots. but real roots are their own conjugates, which contradicts the problem's statement that the roots are given as conjugate pairs \(r_1, \overline{r}_1,...,r_5, \overline{r}_5\). therefore, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.
wait, perhaps the equation has 10 roots which are 5 pairs of conjugates. but when we considered the roots x_k =1/(13 + e^{i(\pi + 2k\pi/10)}), for k=0,...,9, but as we saw, x_0 is real, x_5 is real, and the rest for k=1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9 come as conjugate pairs. therefore, the roots are: x_0 (real), x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5 (real), x_6, x_7, x_8, x_9. but x_6 is conjugate of x_4, etc. so in total, two real roots and four complex conjugate pairs.
however, the problem states that the equation has 10 complex roots given as conjugate pairs, i.e., five pairs. but according to our analysis, two of the roots are real, so perhaps there is a mistake here.
wait, but the problem says "the equation \(x^{10} + (13x -1)^{10}=0\) has 10 complex roots \(r_1, \overline{r}_1, ..., r_5, \overline{r}_5\)." but if all roots are complex and come in conjugate pairs, then the polynomial must have real coefficients, which it does. however, in our analysis, we found two real roots. but real numbers can be considered as complex numbers with zero imaginary part. so maybe the problem is using "complex" in the sense of "in the complex plane" (i.e., allowing real or complex), and stating that they come in five conjugate pairs, where some pairs may be real (i.e., the real roots are paired with themselves). however, vieta's formula would still apply. but perhaps the problem-writer considers complex roots to include real roots, and since real roots can be paired with themselves, you can have five pairs. but x0=1/12 and x5=1/14 are distinct real roots, so to pair them as conjugate pairs, but they are separate. so this seems contradictory.
wait, perhaps my substitution missed something. let me check again.
starting from \(x^{10} + (13x -1)^{10}=0\). then i set z=1/x, and obtained (z−13)^10 = -1. so solving for z gives z=13 + e^{i(π + 2kπ)/10}, k=0,...,9. then x=1/z = 1/(13 + e^{i(π + 2kπ)/10}). for k=0, angle π, which is -1, so x=1/(13-1)=1/12. for k=5, angle π + π = 2π, which is 1, so x=1/(13 +1)=1/14. so indeed, two real roots. so perhaps the problem's statement that the roots are given as conjugate pairs is a misstatement, but in reality, there are two real roots and four complex conjugate pairs.
but the problem says "10 complex roots", which might be considered as 10 roots in the complex plane, some real, some complex. but in any case, the user wants the sum of 1/(r_i \overline{r_i}) for five pairs. but they might consider the real roots as their own conjugate pairs. so x0 and x5 are their own conjugates (since they are real), and the sum would include 1/(x0^2) + 1/(x5^2) + sums over the four pairs of complex roots. but the problem states that the roots are r1, \overline{r1},..., r5, \overline{r5}, which would imply 10 distinct roots. but in our case, if two roots are real, then they must be counted once, but the problem counts them as pairs, which would imply that perhaps the problem's statement is incorrect, or maybe my analysis is missing something.
wait, but in the equation \(x^{10} + (13x -1)^{10}=0\), maybe there's a transformation that shows that all roots actually come in complex conjugate pairs even if they look like they might have real roots. wait, but in our substitution, the roots are x=1/(13 + e^{iθ}), where θ is (π + 2kπ/10). so when k=0, θ=π, so e^{iθ}=-1}, so x=1/(13-1)=1/12. similarly, k=5 gives θ=π + π=2π, e^{i2π}=1, so x=1/(13+1)=1/14. so indeed, two real roots. therefore, in that case, the problem statement might be incorrect in saying that the roots are given as five conjugate pairs, since there are two real roots and four complex conjugate pairs.
but perhaps in the problem statement, they grouped the real roots as two separate roots, and then the complex conjugate pairs, but labeled them in total as five pairs, treating the real roots as pairs with themselves. that is, r1=\overline{r1}=x0, r2, \overline{r2},..., r5=\overline{r5}=x5. but in that case, then the sum would be over 1/(x0^2) + 1/(x5^2) + the four terms for the complex pairs. but in our case, for real roots, since x is real, 1/(x \overline{x}) is just 1/x^2. so for the real roots x0=1/12 and x5=1/14, their 1/(x0^2) = 144, 1/(x5^2)=196. then for the complex roots, each pair would contribute two terms which are the same (since for each complex root r, \overline{r}, we have 1/(r \overline{r}) = 1/|r|^2, and similarly for \overline{r}). so when the problem says "r1, \overline{r1},...", if they list each complex root and its conjugate as separate roots, but in the sum they just take r1, r2, r3, r4, r5, then depending on how they index them. but given that the equation has two real roots and four complex conjugate pairs, the 10 roots are: 1/12, 1/14, (a + bi), (a - bi), (c + di), (c - di), etc. so if the problem lists them as r1=\overline{r1} (1/12), r2, \overline{r2} (the pair (a+bi), (a -bi)), r3, \overline{r3}, etc., then r5 would be \overline{r5} (1/14). but in any case, the sum would be 1/(1/12^2) + 1/(1/14^2) + sum over the four |r_k|^2. wait, no. wait, if r1 is 1/12, then 1/(r1 \overline{r1}) = 1/( (1/12)(1/12) ) = 144. similarly, 1/(r5 \overline{r5}) = 196. then, the other terms, for each complex pair (r_k, \overline{r}_k), 1/(r_k \overline{r}_k) = 1/|r_k|^2, and since r_k and \overline{r}_k would have the same modulus, so each pair contributes two terms which are same in the original sum. but the problem says "the equation has ... r1, \overline{r}_1, ..., r5, \overline{r5}", which would imply that there are 10 roots: r1, conj(r1), r2, conj(r2), etc. so if there are five pairs, then two of the pairs are real numbers (i.e., r1=conj(r1), etc.), but in our case, two roots are real, so there's a contradiction here.
alternatively, perhaps the problem intended all roots to be complex (non-real), and thus in conjugate pairs. but in reality, our analysis shows two real roots. therefore, perhaps there's an error in the problem statement.
but, stepping back, maybe the key is to compute the desired sum \(\sum_{k=0}^{9} \frac{1}{|x_k|^2}\), but since the problem only asks for the sum over one from each pair (but since the problem lists the roots as r1, \overline{r1},..., it's ambiguous). but given that the customer specifies the roots as 5 pairs, even though in reality there are two real roots and four complex pairs, perhaps they consider the two real roots as two separate pairs. so r1=1/12, \overline{r1}=1/12 (same as r1), r2, \overline{r2},..., r5=1/14, \overline{r5}=1/14. then the sum would be 1/( (1/12)^2 ) + 1/( (1/14)^2 ) + sum over the four pairs 1/( |r_i|^2 ). but in our case, the sum would be 144 + 196 + sum over the four pairs. but each complex root x_k has |x_k|^2=1/|13 + e^{iθ_k}|^2, so 1/|x_k|^2=|13 + e^{iθ_k}}|^2. each pair of complex conjugate roots would correspond to angles θ and θ + π? wait, no. wait, the complex roots come in conjugate pairs, which in terms of the exponents: for each complex root x_k, their conjugate x_{k'}= \overline{x_k} corresponds to the exponent θ_{k'}= -θ_k + 2πm. but in our parametrization, θ_k = π + 2kπ/10. so the conjugate exponent would be -θ_k + 2πm. let me check: for x_k=1/(13 + e^{iθ_k}), its conjugate is 1/(13 + e^{-iθ_k}). for which k' is θ_{k'} = -θ_k + 2πm? let's see. suppose θ_{k} = π + 2kπ/10. then θ_{k'} = π + 2k'π/10 = -θ_k + 2πm. so: π + 2k'π/10 = -π - 2kπ/10 + 2πm. then: 2k'π/10 = -2π - 2kπ/10 + 2πm. divide by 2π: k'/5 = -1 -k/10 + m. multiply by 10: 2k' = -10 -k +10m. thus: 2k' +k = -10 +10m. but this seems not helpful. alternatively, perhaps for each k from 1 to 4, there exists a k' such that θ_{k'}= -θ_k + 2π. let's see: θ_k=π + 2kπ/10. then, -θ_k + 2π= -π -2kπ/10 + 2π= π - 2kπ/10. so we need θ_{k'}= π - 2kπ/10. let's solve for k': π + 2k'π/10 = π - 2kπ/10 => 2k'π/10 = -2kπ/10 => k'= -k. since k is from 1 to 4, then k' would be -1, -2, -3, -4. but indices are modulo 10, so k'=9,8,7,6. therefore, for k=1, the conjugate exponent is θ_9=π + 2*9π/10=π + 18π/10=π(1 + 18/10)=π(28/10)=π(14/5). but θ_{k'}=π - 2kπ/10=π - 2*1π/10=π(1 - 1/5)=π(4/5). but 14π/5 is equivalent to 14π/5 - 2π= (14π -10π)/5=4π/5. so θ_9=4π/5, which is equivalent to θ_{k} when k= something. wait, but θ_{k'}=4π/5. let's check if θ_{k'}=π - 2kπ/10=π - 2π/10=13π/15? wait, no. wait, θ_{k'}=π - 2kπ/10. for k=1, θ_{k'}=π - π/5=4π/5=14π/10. but since angles are modulo 2π, 14π/10=7π/5. wait, but 14π/10=7π/5=126 degrees, which is in the third quadrant. wait, but θ_9=π + 2*9π/10=π + 18π/10=28π/10=14π/5=2π + 4π/5. so θ_9 is equivalent to 4π/5. but 4π/5 is in the second quadrant, while 14π/5 is in the fourth quadrant. wait, but 4π/5 and 14π/5 are separated by π. wait, 4π/5=π - π/5, and 14π/5=2π - π/5. so exponents e^{i4π/5} and e^{i14π/5}=e^{-iπ/5} are different. but x_k for k=1 uses angle θ=π + 2*1π/10=π + 2π/10=12π/10=6π/5. wait, hold on: wait, original equation had roots x_k=1/(13 + e^{i(π + 2kπ/10)}). so for k=1, θ
