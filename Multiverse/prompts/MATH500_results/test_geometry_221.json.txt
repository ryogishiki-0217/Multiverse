Okay, so I have this problem: In triangle PQR, PQ = QR = 34 and PR = 32. I need to find the length of the median QM. Alright, let me start by recalling what a median is in a triangle. A median connects a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. So, QM should connect vertex Q to the midpoint M of side PR. Since PR is 32 units long, M should be the midpoint, so PM = MR = 16 each.
Let's think in parallel.

1: The triangle PQR is identified as isosceles because sides PQ and QR are equal. The median QM is therefore also the altitude and angle bisector from Q to PR, implying that angle QMP is a right angle.

2: The Pythagorean theorem might be applicable in triangle QMR. The side QR has a length of 34. The median M is the midpoint of PR, which is 32 units long, so PM = MR = 16. In triangle QMR, sides QR and MR have lengths 34 and 16, respectively. If triangle QMR is a right triangle, the Pythagorean theorem could be used. It is considered whether QMR is a right triangle.
The angle at M is a candidate for being a right angle.
It is questioned whether QM is an altitude, as well as whether it is both a median and an altitude.
If QM were an altitude, triangle PQR would be isosceles with PQ=PR.
The given length of PQ is 34.
The given length of PR is 32.
Since PQ does not equal PR (34 ≠ 32), triangle PQR is not isosceles with PQ=PR.
Therefore, QM is not an altitude.
Triangle QMR is not a right triangle.
The Pythagorean theorem cannot be directly applied to triangle QMR.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
Triangle PQR is isosceles with PQ=QR, making QM a median, angle bisector, and altitude. However, PQ≠PR, so QM is not an altitude, and triangle QMR is not a right triangle; the Pythagorean theorem is not directly applicable to QMR.

Alternatively, maybe using the median length formula in a triangle. I recall that for a median in a triangle, the length can be found using Apollonius's theorem, which states that in any triangle, the sum of the squares of two sides is equal to twice the square of the median to the third side plus twice the square of half the third side. Wait, let me check that again. Apollonius's theorem says: For any triangle, the sum of the squares of any two sides is equal to twice the square of the median to the third side plus twice the square of the third side. Wait, no. Let me write the formula. In triangle ABC, if m_a is the median from A to BC, then: AB2 + AC2 = 2 AM_a2 + 2 BM2 (since BM = CM). Yes, since M is the midpoint, BM is half of BC. So, in our case, the median QM would satisfy: PQ2 + QR2 = 2 QM2 + 2 PM2 Since PM is half of PR, which is 16. So, plugging into the formula: 342 + 342 = 2 QM2 + 2(162) Wait, but PR is 32, so PM is 16. Let me confirm: yes. So: 342 + 342 = 2 QM2 + 2(162) Compute 34 squared. 34^2 = 1156. So left side is 1156 + 1156 = 2312. Right side is 2 QM2 + 2*(256) = 2 QM2 + 512. So: 2312 = 2 QM2 + 512 Subtract 512 from both sides: 2312 - 512 = 1800. So: 1800 = 2 QM2 Divide both sides by 2: 900 = QM2 So QM = 30. Wait, so the median QM is 30? Let me double-check this.

1: The Apollonius's theorem calculation is verified. The formula PQ² + QR² = 2 QM² + 2 PM² is confirmed. PQ and QR are each 34, so PQ² + QR² equals 34² + 34², which is 1156 + 1156, resulting in 2312. PR is 32, so PM is 16, and PM² is 256. The right side of the equation is 2 QM² + 2(256), simplifying to 2 QM² + 512. Equating the left side (2312) to the right side (2 QM² + 512) gives 2312 = 2 QM² + 512. Subtracting 512 from both sides yields 1800 = 2 QM². Dividing by 2 gives 900 = QM², so QM is the square root of 900, which is 30. The calculation is correct, confirming that QM is 30.

2: The coordinates method involves assigning coordinates to the triangle's vertices. The length PR is 32, so placing PR along the x-axis, P can be at (0,0) and R at (32,0). M is the midpoint of PR, so M is at (16,0). Q is a vertex of the triangle, with PQ=34 and QR=34. Let the coordinates of Q be (x,y). The distance from Q to P (PQ) is sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = 34, so x^2 + y^2 = 1156. The distance from Q to R (QR) is sqrt((x-32)^2 + y^2) = 34, so (x-32)^2 + y^2 = 1156. Subtracting the first equation (x^2 + y^2 = 1156) from the second equation ((x-32)^2 + y^2 = 1156) gives (x-32)^2 - x^2 = 0. Expanding (x^2 - 64x + 1024) - x^2 = -64x + 1024 = 0.
Solving -64x + 1024 = 0 yields x = 16.
Substituting x=16 into x^2 + y^2 = 1156 gives 256 + y^2 = 1156.
Solving for y^2 yields y^2 = 900, so y=30.
Therefore, the coordinates of Q are (16,30).
The length of the median QM is the distance from Q(16,30) to M(16,0), which is sqrt((16-16)^2 + (30-0)^2) = sqrt(0 + 900) = 30.
</Path>
<Path>
3: An alternative coordinate system is considered, where M is placed at the origin (0,0). PR is 32 units long, with midpoint M, so points P and R are located at (-16,0) and (16,0) respectively. Point Q is situated somewhere in the plane; the distance from Q to M is to be determined.
The distance from Q to P is 34, and the distance from Q to R is also 34.
Let the coordinates of Q be (0,y), assuming it lies along the perpendicular bisector of PR.
The distance from Q(0,y) to P(-16,0) is sqrt((16)^2 + y^2) and must equal 34.
This gives the equation sqrt(256 + y^2) = 34.
Squaring both sides yields 256 + y^2 = 1024.
Subtracting 256 from both sides gives y^2 = 768.
Taking the square root of both sides gives y = sqrt(768) = 16*sqrt(3).
The length QM is the distance from Q(0,16*sqrt(3)) to M(0,0), which is 16*sqrt(3).
The length 16*sqrt(3) is approximately 27.7128, which is different from the previous result of 30.
This discrepancy suggests an error in one of the methods.
The Apollonius's theorem calculation, which yielded QM=30, is re-examined.
The theorem states that PQ^2 + PR^2 = 2QM^2 + 2PM^2.
Given PQ=34, PR=32, PM=16, and QM is the median length.
Substituting into the formula gives 34^2 + 32^2 = 2QM^2 + 2*16^2.
Calculating the left side: 34^2 = 1156, 32^2 = 1024, summing to 2180.
Calculating the right side: 2*16^2 = 512.
The equation becomes 2180 = 2QM^2 + 512.
Subtracting 512 from both sides gives 1668 = 2QM^2.
Dividing by 2 gives QM^2 = 834, so QM = sqrt(834) ≈ 28.88, which is different from both previous results.
This outcome contradicts the earlier results of 30 and 16*sqrt(3).
The correct application of Apollonius's theorem is questioned.
The theorem is recalled as BM^2 = (2b^2 + 2c^2 - a^2)/4 for a median in a triangle.
In triangle PQR, QM is the median from Q to PR.
The formula for the median from Q to PR is QM = sqrt((2PQ^2 + 2QR^2 - PR^2)/4).
Given PQ=QR=34 and PR=32, substitution yields QM = sqrt((2*34^2 + 2*34^2 - 32^2)/4).
This simplifies to sqrt((4*1156 - 1024)/4).
The numerator calculation is 4*1156 = 4624, then 4624 - 1024 = 3600.
The expression becomes sqrt(3600/4) = sqrt(900) = 30.
This confirms the first calculation using the formula.
The discrepancy with the coordinate method is noted.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The Apollonius's theorem calculation is verified to yield QM=30. The coordinate method, by placing PR on the x-axis, also yields QM=30. The coordinate method, by placing M at the origin, initially yielded QM=16*sqrt(3), but this was identified as an error because the coordinates of Q were incorrectly assumed to be (0,y). Correcting this, the origin placement of M leads to Q having coordinates (16, 30), making QM=30. The formula method confirmed QM=30. All methods, when correctly applied, consistently yield QM=30.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Wait, but when I did the coordinate system, I placed PR from (0,0) to (32,0), midpoint at (16,0). Then found Q at (16,30). So QM is the distance from (16,30) to (16,0) which is 30. So that's correct. So why did I get 16 sqrt(3) before? Wait, that must have been a miscalculation. Wait, in my first coordinate approach, I placed P at (0,0), R at (32,0). Then, Q is at (16, 30), so QM is 30. So that's straightforward. Wait, the second coordinate approach I tried to place M at (0,0), but perhaps I made an error there. Let me see. If M is at (0,0), then PR is from (-16,0) to (16,0). Then, Q is at (0,y). Then, the distance from Q to P is sqrt(162 + y2) = sqrt(256 + y2). Set equal to 34, so 256 + y2 = 1156, so y2 = 1156 - 256 = 900, so y = 30. Therefore, Q is at (0,30), and M is at (0,0), so QM is 30. Wait, so that also gives 30. So my earlier step where I got 16*sqrt(3) must have been wrong. Wait, yep, because in that step, I incorrectly calculated 34^2 - 16^2, which is 1156 - 256 = 900, so sqrt(900) is 30. So Q is at (0,30). So QM is 30. So that's correct. So why did I think it was 16*sqrt(3) before? Wait, maybe I was confusing this with the altitude. If the triangle is equilateral, the altitude would be (sqrt(3)/2)*side, but our triangle isn't equilateral, and even if it were, 32*sqrt(3)/2 would be 16*sqrt(3), but in this case, the sides are 34,34,32, so the altitude from Q would be 30, which is not 16*sqrt(3). 16*sqrt(3) is approximately 27.7, while 30 is 30. So the correct value is 30. So, seems like the correct answer is 30. So why are there conflicting methods? Wait, no, actually, when I did the coordinate system with M at (0,0), Q is at (0,30), so QM is 30. So that's the same as the first method. The Apollonius theorem gives 30. So all methods agree. So where did I get 16*sqrt(3)? That was an error. Wait, y = sqrt(900) = 30, not sqrt(768). sqrt(768) is 16*sqrt(3), but 900 is 302. So that must have been a typo or a miscalculation. So, yes, in the coordinate system, Q is located at (16,30) in one system and (0,30) in the other. So QM is 30 in both correctly done coordinate systems. So the correct answer is 30. So why was the initial coordinate calculation giving 30, Apollonius' theorem after correction also gives 30. So the answer is 30. So the median QM is 30. Wait, but when I first applied Apollonius' theorem, I added PQ2 + QR2, but according to the theorem, it's PQ2 + QR2 = 2 QM2 + 2 PM2. Wait, but in the correct formula, it's indeed for a median, so yes, that holds. So 342 + 342 = 2*302 + 2*162. Let's check: Left side: 1156 + 1156 = 2312. Right side: 2*900 + 2*256 = 1800 + 512 = 2312. Perfect. So that works. So the answer is 30. So where did the confusion come in? Initially, I thought of the median in a right triangle, but this isn't a right triangle, so that wasn't applicable. Then, when setting up coordinates, correctly placing PR as (0,0) to (32,0), computing Q leads to (16,30), so QM is 30. The second coordinate setup also gave 30 when correctly calculated. So, conclusion, the median QM is 30. So the answer is 30. Wait, but just to make sure, let's check with the formula again. The formula for the median in a triangle is: m = sqrt((2a2 + 2b2 - c2)/4) Where a, b, c are sides. In this case, the sides of the triangle are PQ=34, QR=34, PR=32. The median is from Q to PR, so in the formula, we consider PR as the side opposite the median. So, a and b are the sides from Q, which are QR and QP, both 34, and c is PR=32. Wait, the formula is: m = sqrt((2PQ2 + 2QR2 - PR2)/4) So, substituting: m = sqrt((2*342 + 2*342 - 322)/4) = sqrt((2*1156 + 2*1156 - 1024)/4) = sqrt((2312 + 2312 - 1024)/4) Wait, hold on, that can't be right. Wait, no. Wait, the formula is (2*(sum of the squares of two sides) - (third side)^2)/4. Wait, maybe I mixed up the formula. Wait, the median formula from vertex A to side BC is: m_a = sqrt(2b2 + 2c2 - a2)/2 Where a, b, c are the sides opposite to angles A, B, C. So in our case, median from Q to PR, so the median is QM. In triangle PQR, PR is the side opposite to angle Q. The formula for median from Q to PR would be: m_q = sqrt(2PQ2 + 2QR2 - PR2)/2 Wait, but actually, the general formula for median from A is: m_a = (1/2) * sqrt(2b2 + 2c2 - a2) Wait, so if the median is from Q to PR, then: m_Q = (1/2) * sqrt(2*PQ2 + 2*QR2 - PR2) So, substituting PQ=34, QR=34, PR=32: m_Q = (1/2) * sqrt(2*342 + 2*342 - 322) = (1/2) * sqrt(4*342 - 322) Compute 4*342 = 4*1156 = 4624 322 = 1024 So, 4624 - 1024 = 3600 sqrt(3600) = 60 So, m_Q = (1/2)*60 = 30. Yes, so that's again 30. So all methods confirm the answer is 30. So why was there confusion earlier? Because in the initial application of Apollonius' theorem, I added PQ2 + PR2, but PR is the side opposite, so actually, in Apollonius' theorem, for median to side a: b2 + c2 = 2m2 + (a)2/2. Wait, no, in the standard formula, in any triangle, the sum of the squares of two sides is equal to twice the square of the median to the third side plus twice the square of the third side. Wait, maybe I mixed up variables. Let me look up Apollonius' theorem again. According to the theorem, in a triangle, given a triangle with sides a, b, c, and a median m to side a, then: b2 + c2 = 2m2 + 2*(a/2)^2 So here, sides PQ=34, QR=34, PR=32. Median QM is to side PR, so here, PR is 'a', so that: PQ2 + QR2 = 2 QM2 + 2*(PR/2)2 So, 342 + 342 = 2 QM2 + 2*(162) So, 1156 + 1156 = 2 QM2 + 2*256 2312 = 2 QM2 + 512 2312 - 512 = 1800 = 2 QM2 Thus QM2 = 900, QM = 30. So that's consistent. So where did the confusion come in? When I first set up the coordinates with M at (0,0), and tried to place Q at (0,y), but miscalculated the distance. Wait, no, if M is at (0,0), and PR is from (-16,0) to (16,0), then distances from Q(0,y) to P(-16,0) and R(16,0) should both be 34. So distance from Q to P: sqrt((0 - (-16))^2 + (y - 0)^2) = sqrt(256 + y2) = 34, so 256 + y2 = 1156, y2 = 900, y = 30. So Q is at (0,30), and M is at (0,0), so QM is 30. So that's consistent. So why did I previously calculate coordinate system with M at origin as Q at (0,16 sqrt(3))? That was incorrect. Because in that step, I must have miscalculated. Wait, in my earlier steps, I said: "Wait, in this coordinate system, Q is at (0, y). The distance from Q to P is sqrt(162 + y2)=34. So 162 + y2 = 342 ⇒ 256 + y2 = 1156 ⇒ y2 = 900 ⇒ y=30." But I previously, for some reason, thought that sqrt(342 - 162) was sqrt(1156 - 256) = sqrt(900) = 30, but wrote 16 sqrt(3) as an error. So that must have been a typo or miscalculation. Anyway, everything points to the answer being 30. Therefore, the length of median QM is 30. So the final answer is 30.

Answer: To find the length of the median \( \overline{QM} \) in \( \triangle PQR \) with \( PQ = QR = 34 \) and \( PR = 32 \):

1. **Identify Midpoint**: Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( PR \), \( PM = MR = 16 \).

2. **Apply Apollonius's Theorem**: For any triangle, the sum of the squares of two sides is equal to twice the square of the median to the third side plus twice the square of half the third side.
   \[
   PQ^2 + QR^2 = 2 QM^2 + 2 PM^2
   \]
   Substituting the given values:
   \[
   34^2 + 34^2 = 2 QM^2 + 2(16^2)
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   1156 + 1156 = 2 QM^2 + 512
   \]
   \[
   2312 = 2 QM^2 + 512
   \]
   \[
   1800 = 2 QM^2
   \]
   \[
   QM^2 = 900
   \]
   \[
   QM = 30
   \]

3. **Verification with Coordinate Geometry**: Placing \( \triangle PQR \) on a coordinate plane with \( P(0, 0) \), \( R(32, 0) \), and \( M(16, 0) \), we find the coordinates of \( Q \) by solving the distances from \( Q \) to \( P \) and \( R \). This results in \( Q(16, 30) \), confirming the distance from \( Q \) to \( M \) is 30.

Thus, the length of the median \( \overline{QM} \) is \(\boxed{30}\).

the final answer is 30

alternatively, maybe using the median length formula in a triangle. i recall that for a median in a triangle, the length can be found using apollonius's theorem, which states that in any triangle, the sum of the squares of two sides is equal to twice the square of the median to the third side plus twice the square of half the third side. wait, let me check that again. apollonius's theorem says: for any triangle, the sum of the squares of any two sides is equal to twice the square of the median to the third side plus twice the square of the third side. wait, no. let me write the formula. in triangle abc, if m_a is the median from a to bc, then: ab2 + ac2 = 2 am_a2 + 2 bm2 (since bm = cm). yes, since m is the midpoint, bm is half of bc. so, in our case, the median qm would satisfy: pq2 + qr2 = 2 qm2 + 2 pm2 since pm is half of pr, which is 16. so, plugging into the formula: 342 + 342 = 2 qm2 + 2(162) wait, but pr is 32, so pm is 16. let me confirm: yes. so: 342 + 342 = 2 qm2 + 2(162) compute 34 squared. 34^2 = 1156. so left side is 1156 + 1156 = 2312. right side is 2 qm2 + 2*(256) = 2 qm2 + 512. so: 2312 = 2 qm2 + 512 subtract 512 from both sides: 2312 - 512 = 1800. so: 1800 = 2 qm2 divide both sides by 2: 900 = qm2 so qm = 30. wait, so the median qm is 30? let me double-check this.

1: the apollonius's theorem calculation is verified. the formula pq² + qr² = 2 qm² + 2 pm² is confirmed. pq and qr are each 34, so pq² + qr² equals 34² + 34², which is 1156 + 1156, resulting in 2312. pr is 32, so pm is 16, and pm² is 256. the right side of the equation is 2 qm² + 2(256), simplifying to 2 qm² + 512. equating the left side (2312) to the right side (2 qm² + 512) gives 2312 = 2 qm² + 512. subtracting 512 from both sides yields 1800 = 2 qm². dividing by 2 gives 900 = qm², so qm is the square root of 900, which is 30. the calculation is correct, confirming that qm is 30.

2: the coordinates method involves assigning coordinates to the triangle's vertices. the length pr is 32, so placing pr along the x-axis, p can be at (0,0) and r at (32,0). m is the midpoint of pr, so m is at (16,0). q is a vertex of the triangle, with pq=34 and qr=34. let the coordinates of q be (x,y). the distance from q to p (pq) is sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = 34, so x^2 + y^2 = 1156. the distance from q to r (qr) is sqrt((x-32)^2 + y^2) = 34, so (x-32)^2 + y^2 = 1156. subtracting the first equation (x^2 + y^2 = 1156) from the second equation ((x-32)^2 + y^2 = 1156) gives (x-32)^2 - x^2 = 0. expanding (x^2 - 64x + 1024) - x^2 = -64x + 1024 = 0.
solving -64x + 1024 = 0 yields x = 16.
substituting x=16 into x^2 + y^2 = 1156 gives 256 + y^2 = 1156.
solving for y^2 yields y^2 = 900, so y=30.
therefore, the coordinates of q are (16,30).
the length of the median qm is the distance from q(16,30) to m(16,0), which is sqrt((16-16)^2 + (30-0)^2) = sqrt(0 + 900) = 30.

3: an alternative coordinate system is considered, where m is placed at the origin (0,0). pr is 32 units long, with midpoint m, so points p and r are located at (-16,0) and (16,0) respectively. point q is situated somewhere in the plane; the distance from q to m is to be determined.
the distance from q to p is 34, and the distance from q to r is also 34.
let the coordinates of q be (0,y), assuming it lies along the perpendicular bisector of pr.
the distance from q(0,y) to p(-16,0) is sqrt((16)^2 + y^2) and must equal 34.
this gives the equation sqrt(256 + y^2) = 34.
squaring both sides yields 256 + y^2 = 1024.
subtracting 256 from both sides gives y^2 = 768.
taking the square root of both sides gives y = sqrt(768) = 16*sqrt(3).
the length qm is the distance from q(0,16*sqrt(3)) to m(0,0), which is 16*sqrt(3).
the length 16*sqrt(3) is approximately 27.7128, which is different from the previous result of 30.
this discrepancy suggests an error in one of the methods.
the apollonius's theorem calculation, which yielded qm=30, is re-examined.
the theorem states that pq^2 + pr^2 = 2qm^2 + 2pm^2.
given pq=34, pr=32, pm=16, and qm is the median length.
substituting into the formula gives 34^2 + 32^2 = 2qm^2 + 2*16^2.
calculating the left side: 34^2 = 1156, 32^2 = 1024, summing to 2180.
calculating the right side: 2*16^2 = 512.
the equation becomes 2180 = 2qm^2 + 512.
subtracting 512 from both sides gives 1668 = 2qm^2.
dividing by 2 gives qm^2 = 834, so qm = sqrt(834) ≈ 28.88, which is different from both previous results.
this outcome contradicts the earlier results of 30 and 16*sqrt(3).
the correct application of apollonius's theorem is questioned.
the theorem is recalled as bm^2 = (2b^2 + 2c^2 - a^2)/4 for a median in a triangle.
in triangle pqr, qm is the median from q to pr.
the formula for the median from q to pr is qm = sqrt((2pq^2 + 2qr^2 - pr^2)/4).
given pq=qr=34 and pr=32, substitution yields qm = sqrt((2*34^2 + 2*34^2 - 32^2)/4).
this simplifies to sqrt((4*1156 - 1024)/4).
the numerator calculation is 4*1156 = 4624, then 4624 - 1024 = 3600.
the expression becomes sqrt(3600/4) = sqrt(900) = 30.
this confirms the first calculation using the formula.
the discrepancy with the coordinate method is noted.

<conclusion>
the apollonius's theorem calculation is verified to yield qm=30. the coordinate method, by placing pr on the x-axis, also yields qm=30. the coordinate method, by placing m at the origin, initially yielded qm=16*sqrt(3), but this was identified as an error because the coordinates of q were incorrectly assumed to be (0,y). correcting this, the origin placement of m leads to q having coordinates (16, 30), making qm=30. the formula method confirmed qm=30. all methods, when correctly applied, consistently yield qm=30.

wait, but when i did the coordinate system, i placed pr from (0,0) to (32,0), midpoint at (16,0). then found q at (16,30). so qm is the distance from (16,30) to (16,0) which is 30. so that's correct. so why did i get 16 sqrt(3) before? wait, that must have been a miscalculation. wait, in my first coordinate approach, i placed p at (0,0), r at (32,0). then, q is at (16, 30), so qm is 30. so that's straightforward. wait, the second coordinate approach i tried to place m at (0,0), but perhaps i made an error there. let me see. if m is at (0,0), then pr is from (-16,0) to (16,0). then, q is at (0,y). then, the distance from q to p is sqrt(162 + y2) = sqrt(256 + y2). set equal to 34, so 256 + y2 = 1156, so y2 = 1156 - 256 = 900, so y = 30. therefore, q is at (0,30), and m is at (0,0), so qm is 30. wait, so that also gives 30. so my earlier step where i got 16*sqrt(3) must have been wrong. wait, yep, because in that step, i incorrectly calculated 34^2 - 16^2, which is 1156 - 256 = 900, so sqrt(900) is 30. so q is at (0,30). so qm is 30. so that's correct. so why did i think it was 16*sqrt(3) before? wait, maybe i was confusing this with the altitude. if the triangle is equilateral, the altitude would be (sqrt(3)/2)*side, but our triangle isn't equilateral, and even if it were, 32*sqrt(3)/2 would be 16*sqrt(3), but in this case, the sides are 34,34,32, so the altitude from q would be 30, which is not 16*sqrt(3). 16*sqrt(3) is approximately 27.7, while 30 is 30. so the correct value is 30. so, seems like the correct answer is 30. so why are there conflicting methods? wait, no, actually, when i did the coordinate system with m at (0,0), q is at (0,30), so qm is 30. so that's the same as the first method. the apollonius theorem gives 30. so all methods agree. so where did i get 16*sqrt(3)? that was an error. wait, y = sqrt(900) = 30, not sqrt(768). sqrt(768) is 16*sqrt(3), but 900 is 302. so that must have been a typo or a miscalculation. so, yes, in the coordinate system, q is located at (16,30) in one system and (0,30) in the other. so qm is 30 in both correctly done coordinate systems. so the correct answer is 30. so why was the initial coordinate calculation giving 30, apollonius' theorem after correction also gives 30. so the answer is 30. so the median qm is 30. wait, but when i first applied apollonius' theorem, i added pq2 + qr2, but according to the theorem, it's pq2 + qr2 = 2 qm2 + 2 pm2. wait, but in the correct formula, it's indeed for a median, so yes, that holds. so 342 + 342 = 2*302 + 2*162. let's check: left side: 1156 + 1156 = 2312. right side: 2*900 + 2*256 = 1800 + 512 = 2312. perfect. so that works. so the answer is 30. so where did the confusion come in? initially, i thought of the median in a right triangle, but this isn't a right triangle, so that wasn't applicable. then, when setting up coordinates, correctly placing pr as (0,0) to (32,0), computing q leads to (16,30), so qm is 30. the second coordinate setup also gave 30 when correctly calculated. so, conclusion, the median qm is 30. so the answer is 30. wait, but just to make sure, let's check with the formula again. the formula for the median in a triangle is: m = sqrt((2a2 + 2b2 - c2)/4) where a, b, c are sides. in this case, the sides of the triangle are pq=34, qr=34, pr=32. the median is from q to pr, so in the formula, we consider pr as the side opposite the median. so, a and b are the sides from q, which are qr and qp, both 34, and c is pr=32. wait, the formula is: m = sqrt((2pq2 + 2qr2 - pr2)/4) so, substituting: m = sqrt((2*342 + 2*342 - 322)/4) = sqrt((2*1156 + 2*1156 - 1024)/4) = sqrt((2312 + 2312 - 1024)/4) wait, hold on, that can't be right. wait, no. wait, the formula is (2*(sum of the squares of two sides) - (third side)^2)/4. wait, maybe i mixed up the formula. wait, the median formula from vertex a to side bc is: m_a = sqrt(2b2 + 2c2 - a2)/2 where a, b, c are the sides opposite to angles a, b, c. so in our case, median from q to pr, so the median is qm. in triangle pqr, pr is the side opposite to angle q. the formula for median from q to pr would be: m_q = sqrt(2pq2 + 2qr2 - pr2)/2 wait, but actually, the general formula for median from a is: m_a = (1/2) * sqrt(2b2 + 2c2 - a2) wait, so if the median is from q to pr, then: m_q = (1/2) * sqrt(2*pq2 + 2*qr2 - pr2) so, substituting pq=34, qr=34, pr=32: m_q = (1/2) * sqrt(2*342 + 2*342 - 322) = (1/2) * sqrt(4*342 - 322) compute 4*342 = 4*1156 = 4624 322 = 1024 so, 4624 - 1024 = 3600 sqrt(3600) = 60 so, m_q = (1/2)*60 = 30. yes, so that's again 30. so all methods confirm the answer is 30. so why was there confusion earlier? because in the initial application of apollonius' theorem, i added pq2 + pr2, but pr is the side opposite, so actually, in apollonius' theorem, for median to side a: b2 + c2 = 2m2 + (a)2/2. wait, no, in the standard formula, in any triangle, the sum of the squares of two sides is equal to twice the square of the median to the third side plus twice the square of the third side. wait, maybe i mixed up variables. let me look up apollonius' theorem again. according to the theorem, in a triangle, given a triangle with sides a, b, c, and a median m to side a, then: b2 + c2 = 2m2 + 2*(a/2)^2 so here, sides pq=34, qr=34, pr=32. median qm is to side pr, so here, pr is 'a', so that: pq2 + qr2 = 2 qm2 + 2*(pr/2)2 so, 342 + 342 = 2 qm2 + 2*(162) so, 1156 + 1156 = 2 qm2 + 2*256 2312 = 2 qm2 + 512 2312 - 512 = 1800 = 2 qm2 thus qm2 = 900, qm = 30. so that's consistent. so where did the confusion come in? when i first set up the coordinates with m at (0,0), and tried to place q at (0,y), but miscalculated the distance. wait, no, if m is at (0,0), and pr is from (-16,0) to (16,0), then distances from q(0,y) to p(-16,0) and r(16,0) should both be 34. so distance from q to p: sqrt((0 - (-16))^2 + (y - 0)^2) = sqrt(256 + y2) = 34, so 256 + y2 = 1156, y2 = 900, y = 30. so q is at (0,30), and m is at (0,0), so qm is 30. so that's consistent. so why did i previously calculate coordinate system with m at origin as q at (0,16 sqrt(3))? that was incorrect. because in that step, i must have miscalculated. wait, in my earlier steps, i said: "wait, in this coordinate system, q is at (0, y). the distance from q to p is sqrt(162 + y2)=34. so 162 + y2 = 342 ⇒ 256 + y2 = 1156 ⇒ y2 = 900 ⇒ y=30." but i previously, for some reason, thought that sqrt(342 - 162) was sqrt(1156 - 256) = sqrt(900) = 30, but wrote 16 sqrt(3) as an error. so that must have been a typo or miscalculation. anyway, everything points to the answer being 30. therefore, the length of median qm is 30. so the final answer is 30.

answer: to find the length of the median \( \overline{qm} \) in \( \triangle pqr \) with \( pq = qr = 34 \) and \( pr = 32 \):

1. **identify midpoint**: since \( m \) is the midpoint of \( pr \), \( pm = mr = 16 \).

2. **apply apollonius's theorem**: for any triangle, the sum of the squares of two sides is equal to twice the square of the median to the third side plus twice the square of half the third side.
   \[
   pq^2 + qr^2 = 2 qm^2 + 2 pm^2
   \]
   substituting the given values:
   \[
   34^2 + 34^2 = 2 qm^2 + 2(16^2)
   \]
   simplifying:
   \[
   1156 + 1156 = 2 qm^2 + 512
   \]
   \[
   2312 = 2 qm^2 + 512
   \]
   \[
   1800 = 2 qm^2
   \]
   \[
   qm^2 = 900
   \]
   \[
   qm = 30
   \]

3. **verification with coordinate geometry**: placing \( \triangle pqr \) on a coordinate plane with \( p(0, 0) \), \( r(32, 0) \), and \( m(16, 0) \), we find the coordinates of \( q \) by solving the distances from \( q \) to \( p \) and \( r \). this results in \( q(16, 30) \), confirming the distance from \( q \) to \( m \) is 30.

thus, the length of the median \( \overline{qm} \) is \(\boxed{30}\).

the final answer is 30
