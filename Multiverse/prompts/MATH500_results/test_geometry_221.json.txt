Okay, let's see. I need to find the length of the median QM in triangle PQR where PQ = QR = 34 and PR = 32. Since QM is a median, that means it goes from vertex Q to the midpoint M of side PR. Hmm, okay.
First, I remember that in a triangle, a median connects a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. So since PR is the base, and M is the midpoint, that means PM = MR = 16 each, because PR is 32. So M is the midpoint, splitting PR into two equal parts.
Now, how do I find the length of QM? Since it's a median in an isosceles triangle, maybe there's a specific formula or theorem that applies here. Wait, I recall that in an isosceles triangle, the median from the apex (the vertex between the two equal sides) to the base also serves as the altitude and the angle bisector. But in this case, PQ = QR, so the apex is Q, and PR is the base. So, the median QM should also be the altitude, right?
Wait, but wait—hold on. If PQ = QR, then triangle PQR is isosceles with PQ and QR as the legs. So, sides PQ and QR are both 34, and the base is PR = 32. So yes, Q is the apex, and PR is the base. Therefore, the median QM from Q to PR would indeed also be the altitude. So that means QM is perpendicular to PR.
If that's the case, then triangle QPM would be a right triangle with right angle at M. So QM is one of the legs, PM is another leg (which is 16), and PQ is the hypotenuse, which is 34. Wait, that seems straightforward. Then, can I just use the Pythagorean theorem here?
So in right triangle QPM, PQ^2 = QM^2 + PM^2. So 34^2 = QM^2 + 16^2. Then solving for QM: QM^2 = 34^2 - 16^2. Let me compute that.
34 squared is 1156, 16 squared is 256. So QM^2 = 1156 - 256 = 900. Then QM is sqrt(900) = 30. So is that the answer? 30.
But let me confirm. Since QM is the median in the isosceles triangle from Q to PR, which is also the altitude, then yes, splitting PR into two equal parts, 16 each. Then using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by Q, M, and one of the base vertices (P or R). So yes, that seems right. So the median length would be 30.
But wait, before finalizing that, I also recall there is a formula for the length of a median in a triangle. Maybe I should check using the general formula to confirm.
The formula for the length of a median in a triangle. For any triangle, the length of the median from vertex A to side BC is given by:
Median length = sqrt[(2AB^2 + 2AC^2 - BC^2)/4]
But wait, is that formula correct? Let me recall. Yes, the formula is:
m_a = 1/2 * sqrt(2b^2 + 2c^2 - a^2)
where a, b, c are the sides opposite to angles A, B, C. So if median is from vertex A to side a, then the formula is m_a = 1/2 sqrt(2b^2 + 2c^2 - a^2).
But in this problem, the median is QM, from vertex Q to side PR, which is side QR in the triangle. Wait, no, PR is the side opposite to angle Q. Wait, PQ = QR = 34, PR = 32. So in triangle PQR, PQ and QR are the two equal sides (34 each), PR is the base (32). So median QM is from Q to midpoint M of PR.
So using the formula for the median from vertex Q, which in this case, since PR is the base, sides adjacent to Q are PQ and QR, which are equal to 34, and the base is PR = 32.
So the formula would be m_q = 1/2 * sqrt(2*PQ^2 + 2*QR^2 - QP^2). Wait, no. Wait, the formula for median to side BC is m_c = 1/2 sqrt(2AB^2 + 2AC^2 - BC^2). Wait, perhaps I need to adjust.
Wait, no. Wait, if the median is from vertex Q to side PR, then the formula would be m_q = 1/2 sqrt(2*PQ^2 + 2*QR^2 - PR^2). Wait, but PQ and QR are both 34, and PR is 32.
So plugging into the formula: m_q = 1/2 sqrt(2*(34)^2 + 2*(34)^2 - (32)^2) = 1/2 sqrt(4*(34)^2 - (32)^2).
Compute 34 squared is 1156, so 4*1156 = 4624. Then 32 squared is 1024.
So 4624 - 1024 = 3600. So sqrt(3600) = 60. Then 1/2 * 60 = 30.
So same answer. So that does confirm that the median length is 30. So whether I use the fact that in the isosceles triangle, the median is also the altitude and use the Pythagorean theorem, or use the general median formula, both give the answer 30. So that increases my confidence that the answer is 30.
Alternatively, maybe coordinate geometry. Let me try placing the triangle on coordinate axes. Since it's an isosceles triangle with base PR = 32 and equal sides PQ and QR of 34 each.
Let me place point M, the midpoint of PR, at the origin (0,0). Then since PR is 32 long, points P and R will be at (-16, 0) and (16, 0) respectively, since M is the midpoint.
Point Q is somewhere on the y-axis because QM is the altitude and median, so it should be along the perpendicular bisector of PR. So let's denote Q as (0, h). Then, the distance from Q to P and Q to R should both be 34.
Let's take point P(-16, 0) and Q(0, h). The distance PQ is sqrt[(0 - (-16))^2 + (h - 0)^2] = sqrt[16^2 + h^2] = sqrt(256 + h^2) = 34. So sqrt(256 + h^2) = 34. Then squaring both sides: 256 + h^2 = 1156. So h^2 = 1156 - 256 = 900. Then h = 30. Therefore, the coordinates of Q are (0,30). Then the median QM is just the segment from Q(0,30) to M(0,0). The distance between these points is 30 units. So that's another way to see it.
Perfect. So coordinate geometry also confirms that the length of QM is 30. So all methods lead to 30, so I think that's the correct answer.
**Final Answer**
\boxed{30}

Answer: In $\triangle PQR$, we have $PQ = QR = 34$ and $PR = 32$. We need to find the length of the median $\overline{QM}$.

Since $\triangle PQR$ is isosceles with $PQ = QR$, the median from $Q$ to the midpoint $M$ of $PR$ is also the altitude. The midpoint $M$ divides $PR$ into two equal segments, each of length $16$.

Using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle $QPM$:
\[
PQ^2 = QM^2 + PM^2
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
34^2 = QM^2 + 16^2
\]
\[
1156 = QM^2 + 256
\]
\[
QM^2 = 1156 - 256 = 900
\]
\[
QM = \sqrt{900} = 30
\]

We also verified this result using the median formula for a triangle and coordinate geometry, both confirming the length of the median $QM$ is 30.

\[
\boxed{30}

okay, let's see. i need to find the length of the median qm in triangle pqr where pq = qr = 34 and pr = 32. since qm is a median, that means it goes from vertex q to the midpoint m of side pr. hmm, okay.
first, i remember that in a triangle, a median connects a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. so since pr is the base, and m is the midpoint, that means pm = mr = 16 each, because pr is 32. so m is the midpoint, splitting pr into two equal parts.

wait, but wait—hold on. if pq = qr, then triangle pqr is isosceles with pq and qr as the legs. so, sides pq and qr are both 34, and the base is pr = 32. so yes, q is the apex, and pr is the base. therefore, the median qm from q to pr would indeed also be the altitude. so that means qm is perpendicular to pr.
if that's the case, then triangle qpm would be a right triangle with right angle at m. so qm is one of the legs, pm is another leg (which is 16), and pq is the hypotenuse, which is 34. wait, that seems straightforward. then, can i just use the pythagorean theorem here?
so in right triangle qpm, pq^2 = qm^2 + pm^2. so 34^2 = qm^2 + 16^2. then solving for qm: qm^2 = 34^2 - 16^2. let me compute that.
34 squared is 1156, 16 squared is 256. so qm^2 = 1156 - 256 = 900. then qm is sqrt(900) = 30. so is that the answer? 30.
but let me confirm. since qm is the median in the isosceles triangle from q to pr, which is also the altitude, then yes, splitting pr into two equal parts, 16 each. then using the pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by q, m, and one of the base vertices (p or r). so yes, that seems right. so the median length would be 30.

the formula for the length of a median in a triangle. for any triangle, the length of the median from vertex a to side bc is given by:
median length = sqrt[(2ab^2 + 2ac^2 - bc^2)/4]
but wait, is that formula correct? let me recall. yes, the formula is:
m_a = 1/2 * sqrt(2b^2 + 2c^2 - a^2)
where a, b, c are the sides opposite to angles a, b, c. so if median is from vertex a to side a, then the formula is m_a = 1/2 sqrt(2b^2 + 2c^2 - a^2).
but in this problem, the median is qm, from vertex q to side pr, which is side qr in the triangle. wait, no, pr is the side opposite to angle q. wait, pq = qr = 34, pr = 32. so in triangle pqr, pq and qr are the two equal sides (34 each), pr is the base (32). so median qm is from q to midpoint m of pr.
so using the formula for the median from vertex q, which in this case, since pr is the base, sides adjacent to q are pq and qr, which are equal to 34, and the base is pr = 32.
so the formula would be m_q = 1/2 * sqrt(2*pq^2 + 2*qr^2 - qp^2). wait, no. wait, the formula for median to side bc is m_c = 1/2 sqrt(2ab^2 + 2ac^2 - bc^2). wait, perhaps i need to adjust.
wait, no. wait, if the median is from vertex q to side pr, then the formula would be m_q = 1/2 sqrt(2*pq^2 + 2*qr^2 - pr^2). wait, but pq and qr are both 34, and pr is 32.
so plugging into the formula: m_q = 1/2 sqrt(2*(34)^2 + 2*(34)^2 - (32)^2) = 1/2 sqrt(4*(34)^2 - (32)^2).
compute 34 squared is 1156, so 4*1156 = 4624. then 32 squared is 1024.
so 4624 - 1024 = 3600. so sqrt(3600) = 60. then 1/2 * 60 = 30.
so same answer. so that does confirm that the median length is 30. so whether i use the fact that in the isosceles triangle, the median is also the altitude and use the pythagorean theorem, or use the general median formula, both give the answer 30. so that increases my confidence that the answer is 30.
alternatively, maybe coordinate geometry. let me try placing the triangle on coordinate axes. since it's an isosceles triangle with base pr = 32 and equal sides pq and qr of 34 each.
let me place point m, the midpoint of pr, at the origin (0,0). then since pr is 32 long, points p and r will be at (-16, 0) and (16, 0) respectively, since m is the midpoint.
point q is somewhere on the y-axis because qm is the altitude and median, so it should be along the perpendicular bisector of pr. so let's denote q as (0, h). then, the distance from q to p and q to r should both be 34.
let's take point p(-16, 0) and q(0, h). the distance pq is sqrt[(0 - (-16))^2 + (h - 0)^2] = sqrt[16^2 + h^2] = sqrt(256 + h^2) = 34. so sqrt(256 + h^2) = 34. then squaring both sides: 256 + h^2 = 1156. so h^2 = 1156 - 256 = 900. then h = 30. therefore, the coordinates of q are (0,30). then the median qm is just the segment from q(0,30) to m(0,0). the distance between these points is 30 units. so that's another way to see it.
perfect. so coordinate geometry also confirms that the length of qm is 30. so all methods lead to 30, so i think that's the correct answer.

answer: in $\triangle pqr$, we have $pq = qr = 34$ and $pr = 32$. we need to find the length of the median $\overline{qm}$.

since $\triangle pqr$ is isosceles with $pq = qr$, the median from $q$ to the midpoint $m$ of $pr$ is also the altitude. the midpoint $m$ divides $pr$ into two equal segments, each of length $16$.

using the pythagorean theorem in the right triangle $qpm$:
\[
pq^2 = qm^2 + pm^2
\]
substituting the known values:
\[
34^2 = qm^2 + 16^2
\]
\[
1156 = qm^2 + 256
\]
\[
qm^2 = 1156 - 256 = 900
\]
\[
qm = \sqrt{900} = 30
\]

we also verified this result using the median formula for a triangle and coordinate geometry, both confirming the length of the median $qm$ is 30.

\[
\boxed{30}
\]
