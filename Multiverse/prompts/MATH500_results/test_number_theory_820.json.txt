Okay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where a and b are positive integers with gcd(a, b) = 210, lcm[a, b] = 2103, and a < b. The question is asking how many possible values there are for a. Hmm, okay.
First, I remember that there's a relationship between gcd and lcm of two numbers.
Specifically, for any two positive integers a and b, the product of their gcd and lcm is equal to the product of the numbers themselves.
So, gcd(a, b) * lcm[a, b] = a * b.

1: The numbers a and b can be expressed in terms of their GCD. Since gcd(a, b) = 210, both a and b must be multiples of 210. Let's denote a = 210 * m and b = 210 * n, where m and n are positive integers. The condition that gcd(a, b) = 210 implies that gcd(m, n) must be 1, because if m and n had a common divisor d > 1, then gcd(a, b) would be 210 * d, which contradicts the given gcd(a, b) = 210.

2: The product of m and n is calculated. The product a*b is equal to (210m)*(210n), which simplifies to 210^2 * mn. This product is also given as 210^4. Equating these expressions (210^2 * mn = 210^4) shows that mn must be equal to 210^2, as 210^2 * mn = 210^4 implies mn = 210^2.

The numbers a and b were factored as 210m and 210n with gcd(m,n)=1, and the product of m and n was determined to be 210^2.

Therefore, m and n are coprime positive integers such that m * n = 2102, and a < b implies that 210m < 210n, so m < n.
Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of possible values for m, where m and n are coprime integers, m * n = 2102, and m < n. The number of such m's is equal to half the number of ordered pairs (m, n) with m * n = 2102 and gcd(m, n) = 1. But if the divisors m and n are coprime and m * n = 2102, that means that m and n are squares of divisors of 210, right? Wait, maybe not squares. Let's think again.

If m and n are coprime and multiply to 2102, then each prime in the factorization must go entirely to m or entirely to n. Since the exponents in 2102 are all 2's, each prime factor (2, 3, 5, 7) must be given entirely to one of m or n. Therefore, for each prime factor, we can assign it to either m or n, but not both.
Therefore, the number of such pairs (m, n) is 2^4 = 16, since there are 4 prime factors, and each can be assigned to m or n independently.
However, since m and n are ordered and m < n, we need to divide by 2 to account for the fact that each unordered pair is counted twice, except when m = n, but in our case m ≠ n because gcd(m, n) = 1 and m * n is a square, so m ≠ n. Wait, but 2102 is a square. If m and n are coprime and m * n = k2, then m and n must both be squares? Wait, no. Wait, if m and n are coprime and m * n = k2, then m and n are squares, but only if m and n are coprime. Hmm, actually, yes. Let me recall that theorem. If two coprime numbers multiply to a square, then each is a square. So indeed, since m and n are coprime and m * n = (210)2, then m and n must be perfect squares. So m = s2, n = t2, with s and t positive integers, s * t = 210, and gcd(s, t) = 1. So perhaps another way to think about it is that first we need to find the number of square divisors m2 of 2102 such that m2 < n2, where n2 = 2102 / m2. But since m and n would be the square roots, s and t as coprime integers. Hmm.
Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think about the prime factors. Since m and n are coprime and m * n = 2102, then each prime factor must go to either m or n. So for each prime factor in 210 (which are 2, 3, 5, 7), we can assign them to either m or n. Therefore, the number of possible assignments is 2^4 = 16, as each prime is independent. However, since m < n, the assignments where primes are assigned to m or to n would result in different values, but we have to consider the order. Since m and n are distinct (because m * n is a square of a number, 2102, but m and n are coprime, so m ≠ n), then half of these assignments would have m < n and the other half n < m. Therefore, the number of such pairs (m, n) with m < n is 2^4 / 2 = 2^3 = 8.
Wait, but 2^4 is 16, divided by 2 would be 8? But that seems too low. Let's check.
Wait, 2102 is 22 * 32 * 52 * 72. The number of square-free divisors would not be the same as the number of ways to assign primes to m or n. Wait, but since m and n are products of primes, each prime either in m or in n, then m is the product of primes assigned to m, and n is the product of primes assigned to n. However, m and n here would be square-free? Wait, no. Wait, no, because each prime exponent in 2102 is 2. So, if m gets a prime, it gets both copies of the prime (since the prime's square is assigned to m), so m would be a square. So m and n are actually squares of square-free numbers. Wait, maybe m is the square of the product of assigned primes. Let me clarify. For example, for each prime p in {2,3,5,7}, we decide whether to include both p's in m2 or both in n2. Then m2 is the product of the squares of the primes assigned to m, and similarly for n2. Therefore, each such assignment corresponds to a pair (m2, n2) where m and n are square-free numbers (products of distinct primes), squared. So m2 = (2 * 3 * 5 * 7)^2, but no, depending on assignments. For instance, if I assign 2 and 3 to m, and 5 and 7 to n, then m2 = (2*3)^2 = 62 and n2 = (5*7)^2 = 352, but then m2 * n2 = (2*3*5*7)^2 = 2102. Wait, but in that case, m and n (the square roots) would be 6 and 35, so m * n = 6*35=210, but the actual m2 * n2 is (62)*(352) = (210)^2. Wait, but the original problem has a*b = 210^4, so the m and n here (the square roots) would satisfy m * n = 210. Wait, maybe I need to adjust. Wait, let's clarify. If a = 210 * m and b = 210 * n, with gcd(m, n)=1, then ab = 2102 * m*n = 210^4, so m*n = 2102. So m and n are coprime integers such that m*n = 2102. So m and n must be squares of coprime integers, since their product is a square. Let's let m = k2 and n = l2, where k and l are coprime and k*l = 210. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of possible k such that k < l, with k*l = 210 and gcd(k, l) = 1. So now, we need to find the number of coprime pairs (k, l) where k*l = 210, and k < l. So the number of such k's would be the number of divisors k of 210, such that gcd(k, 210/k) = 1, and k < 210/k. Which simplifies to k^2 < 210. Therefore, k is a divisor of 210, k and 210/k are coprime, and k2 < 210. Wait, but if k and 210/k are coprime, that's equivalent to gcd(k, 210/k) = 1, which is the same as gcd(k, 210) = 1, since any divisor k of 210 satisfies 210/k is an integer, and gcd(k, 210/k) = gcd(k, 210/ k) = gcd(k, 210)/k. Wait, maybe not the best way. Let's see. If k is a divisor of 210, then 210 = k * m, where m = 210/k. So if gcd(k, m) = 1, then k and m are coprime divisors of 210. So the problem reduces to finding the number of divisors k of 210 such that k and 210/k are coprime, and k < 210/k. Which is the same as finding the number of divisors k of 210 where gcd(k, 210/k) = 1, hence gcd(k, 210) = 1. Because if gcd(k, 210) = d >1, then since 210/k = m, then gcd(k, m) = d >1. But we need gcd(k, m) =1, so that implies gcd(k, 210) =1. Wait, but 210/k is an integer only if k is a divisor of 210. So, if k is a divisor of 210 and m = 210/k, then gcd(k, m) = gcd(k, 210/k). If d = gcd(k, m), then d divides k and m = 210/k, so d divides k and 210/k. Then d divides gcd(k, 210/k) = gcd(k, 210)/k. Wait, maybe I need to recall that gcd(k, m) = gcd(k, 210/k) = gcd(k, 210)/k. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, suppose that d = gcd(k, m), then d divides k and m, so d divides 210. Let k = d * k' and m = d * m', so then 210 = k * m = d * k' * d * m' = d2 * k' * m'. Therefore, d2 divides 210, so d must be a divisor of sqrt(210), but since 210 is square-free (its prime factors are distinct primes 2,3,5,7, all exponent 1), so d must be 1. Therefore, gcd(k, m) =1 if and only if gcd(k, 210) =1. Because if gcd(k,210)=d>1, then since m=210/k, then d divides k and 210, hence d divides m as well, so gcd(k,m)=d>1. Contradiction. Therefore, for gcd(k, m)=1, we must have gcd(k, 210)=1. But wait, if k divides 210 and gcd(k, 210)=1, then k must be 1. But that would mean m=210, which is greater than k=1. So, the only such divisor is k=1? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let's take an example. Let's take k=2, which is a prime divisor of 210. Then m=210/2=105. Are 2 and 105 coprime? Well, 105 is divisible by 5 and 7, which 2 is prime, so yes, gcd(2,105)=1. Similarly, take k=3. Then m=70. gcd(3,70)=1. Similarly, k=5, m=42. gcd(5,42)=1. k=7, m=30. gcd(7,30)=1. So, in fact, if k is a prime divisor of 210 (2,3,5,7), then m=210/k is coprime to k, even though k divides 210. Wait, so in these cases, gcd(k,210) is k, which is greater than 1, but gcd(k, m)=1. So my previous reasoning is wrong. So, in fact, the key is that k and m=210/k are coprime. So given k is a divisor of 210, what conditions must k satisfy so that gcd(k, 210/k) =1. Which is equivalent to saying that there is no prime p such that p divides k and p divides 210/k. Since k divides 210, let's write 210 = k * m. If a prime p divides k and 210/k = m, then p divides both k and m, hence p divides gcd(k, m). But we need gcd(k, m)=1. Therefore, there should be no prime dividing both k and m. But since k divides 210, and m=210/k, then if there is a prime p dividing k, then p divides 210, but p must not divide m. Since m=210/k, then 210 = k * m. So if p divides k, and p divides 210, then p divides 210 but p should not divide m. But since 210 = k * m, and p divides k, then p divides 210. If p divides m, then p divides gcd(k, m). So to ensure that gcd(k, m)=1, we need that for every prime p in k, p does not divide m. But since 210 = k * m, the prime factors of k and m must together be the prime factors of 210. Since 210 is square-free, each prime is in either k or m. Therefore, k can be any subset of the prime factors of 210. So each k is a product of a subset of {2,3,5,7}, and m is the product of the complementary subset. Therefore, since 210 has 4 prime factors, the number of such divisors k is 2^4 =16. Each pair (k, m) is just a pair of complementary divisors. However, since we have k < m, which is equivalent to k < 210/k, or k2 < 210. So we need to find the number of divisors k of 210 where k2 < 210. Since 210 is 2*3*5*7=210, so 210=210, so sqrt(210) approx 14.49. So k must be less than 14.49. The divisors k of 210 are 1,2,3,5,6,7,10,14,15,21,30,35,42,50,70,105,210. Let's list them and see which are less than sqrt(210)≈14.49. So the divisors less than 14.49 are: 1,2,3,5,6,7,10,14. 1: 1*210=210, gcd(1,210)=1: valid. 2:2*105=210, gcd(2,105)=1: valid. 3:3*70, gcd(3,70)=1: valid. 5:5*42, gcd(5,42)=1: valid. 6:6*35, gcd(6,35)=1: 6=2*3, 35=5*7; no common factors: valid. 7:7*30, gcd(7,30)=1: valid. 10:10*21, gcd(10,21)=1: 10=2*5, 21=3*7: valid. 14:14*15, gcd(14,15)=1: 14=2*7,15=3*5: valid. So all these divisors (1,2,3,5,6,7,10,14) when paired with their complementary divisors (210,105,70,42,35,30,21,15) have gcd 1, and the pairs are coprime. So there are 8 such k's where k < m. Therefore, there are 8 possible values for m (since each k corresponds to m = k and n =210/k), but wait, no. Wait, in terms of the original problem, m and n are squares. Wait, hold on. Wait, I might have confused variables here. Let me recap. Originally, we have a = 210m, b=210n, where m and n are coprime and m*n = 2102. So m and n are squares of coprime integers s and t where s*t=210. Wait, but maybe not. Wait, if m and n are squares and coprime, then m = s2 and n = t2, with s and t coprime and s*t =210. Because m*n = s2 * t2 = (st)^2 = 2102 => st=210. So since m and n are squares of coprime numbers s and t, then the number of possible m's is equal to the number of ways to write 210 as a product of two coprime positive integers s and t, with s < t. Since s and t are coprime, and order matters such that s < t. So, how many such pairs (s, t) are there with s < t and st =210. But since s and t must be coprime, and st=210, this is equivalent to finding the number of ordered pairs (s, t) where s divides 210, t=210/s, gcd(s, t)=1, and s < t. Which is exactly the same as before. So similar to earlier, 210 is square-free (exponents of primes are all 1), so the coprime pairs (s, t) with st=210 correspond to splitting the prime factors of 210 into two sets, each forming s and t. Since s and t must be coprime, each prime factor goes either to s or to t. Thus, the number of such unordered pairs is 2^(4 -1) = 2^3 =8? Wait, no. Wait, for each prime factor, we can assign it to s or t. So for 4 prime factors, there are 2^4=16 possible assignments. However, since st=210, s and t are ordered. But since we need coprime pairs (s, t) with s < t, and st=210, the number of such pairs is half the number of coprime ordered pairs (s, t) with st=210. But since each assignment of primes to s or t gives a unique coprime pair (s, t) because all primes are assigned to one or the other. So the number of ordered coprime pairs (s, t) with st=210 is 2^4=16. But since s and t are determined by which primes they get assigned. However, since 210 is square-free, each s corresponds to a unique subset of the primes, and t is the complement. So to get s < t, since s and t are complementary in the primes, then for each such unordered pair, there are two ordered pairs (s, t) and (t, s). Except when s = t, but since 210 is square-free, s = t only if 210 is a square, which it isn't. Therefore, the number of ordered pairs (s, t) with s < t, st=210, and gcd(s, t)=1 is 2^(4 -1) = 8? Wait, 4 primes, each assigned to s or t, but considering order and s < t, so the number of unordered pairs is 2^(4 -1) = 8? Wait, actually, the formula for the number of unordered coprime pairs with product N is 2^(ω(N) -1), where ω(N) is the number of distinct prime factors. Since N=210 has ω(210)=4, so 2^(4 -1) = 8. Therefore, there are 8 unordered pairs. Therefore, 8 possible values for s (since each unordered pair (s, t) corresponds to one s where s < t). Therefore, the number of possible m's is 8, since each s corresponds to m = s2. Therefore, the number of possible values for a is 8. But let's verify this by listing all coprime pairs (s, t) with st=210 and s < t. The prime factors of 210 are 2,3,5,7. Assign each prime to s or t. Possible assignments: 1. Assign 2 to s, 3,5,7 to t: s=2, t=3*5*7=105. Check (2,105). gcd(2,105)=1? Yes. 2. Assign 3 to s, 2,5,7 to t: s=3, t=2*5*7=70. (3,70). gcd=1. Yes. 3. Assign 5 to s, 2,3,7 to t: s=5, t=2*3*7=42. (5,42). Yes. 4. Assign 7 to s, 2,3,5 to t: s=7, t=2*3*5=30. (7,30). Yes. 5. Assign 2 and 3 to s, 5,7 to t: s=2*3=6, t=5*7=35. (6,35). gcd=1. Yes. 6. Assign 2 and 5 to s, 3,7 to t: s=2*5=10, t=3*7=21. (10,21). Yes. 7. Assign 2 and 7 to s,3 and5 to t: s=2*7=14, t=3*5=15. (14,15). Yes. 8. Assign 3 and 5 to s, 2 and7 to t: s=3*5=15, t=2*7=14. But this would be (15,14), but s < t, so this is already covered in the previous case where s=14, t=15. Similarly, assignments of three primes to s would result in s > t. So the possible coprime pairs (s, t) with s < t are exactly the 8 pairs listed above: (2,105), (3,70), (5,42), (6,35), (7,30), (10,21), (14,15). Wait, that's 7 pairs. Wait, but earlier reasoning suggested 8. Wait, perhaps I missed one. Let's recount. Assign primes: 1. Assign 2 to s: s=2, t=3*5*7=105. (2,105). 2. Assign 3 to s: s=3, t=2*5*7=70. (3,70). 3. Assign 5 to s: s=5, t=2*3*7=42. (5,42). 4. Assign 7 to s: s=7, t=2*3*5=30. (7,30). 5. Assign 2 and 3 to s: s=6, t=5*7=35. (6,35). 6. Assign 2 and 5 to s: s=10, t=3*7=21. (10,21). 7. Assign 2 and 7 to s: s=14, t=3*5=15. (14,15). 8. Assign 3 and 5 to s: s=15, t=2*7=14. But s=15 < t=14? No, so this would be (14,15) again. Wait, but 3 and 5 assigned to s, which would require t=2 and 7. So s=15, t=14. Since s=15 < t=14 is not true, so this is invalid. So perhaps only 7 pairs? Wait, where is the 8th pair? Wait, maybe assigning 3 and 7: s=21, t=2*5=10. (10,21) is already considered as s=10, t=21. Similarly, assigning 5 and 7: s=35, t=2*3=6. (6,35) already considered. Assigning 2,3,5 to s: s=30, t=7. But s=30 > t=7, so not applicable. Assigning 2,3,7 to s: s=42, t=5. s=42 > t=5. Similarly, assigning 2,5,7: s=70, t=3. Assigning 3,5,7: s=105, t=2. So, in all, the unique (s, t) pairs with s < t are indeed the 7 pairs listed. But earlier thought process suggested 8. So, where is the 8th pair? Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's check again. The prime factors are 2,3,5,7. How many ways can we split them into two coprime parts where the order matters (s < t). But in splitting the primes into two sets, each assignment corresponds to a unique factorization into coprime s and t. For each subset A of the primes, s is the product of primes in A, t is the product of primes not in A. Since st=210, to have s < t, the subset A must have product s < t=210/s, so s2 < 210. So same as previous reasoning. So s must be a product of some subset of primes, such that s2 <210. The possible square factors m would be s2 where s is a product of a subset and s2 <210. Let's compute: Possible s values (product of subsets): 1. s=1: m=1^2=1. 2. s=2: m=4. 3. s=3: m=9. 4. s=5: m=25. 5. s=7: m=49. 6. s=2*3=6: m=36. 7. s=2*5=10: m=100. 8. s=2*7=14: m=196. 9. s=3*5=15: m=225. But 152=225 >210, so m=225 is invalid. Similarly, other combinations: s=3*7=21: 212=441 too big. s=5*7=35:352=1225 too big. s=2*3*5=30:900 too big. etc. So the valid s's where s2 <210 are: s=1,2,3,5,6,7,10,14. So their squares are: 1,4,9,25,36,49,100,196. These are 8 values. But wait, in the initial pairing where m and n are coprime and m*n=2102, then a=210*sqrt(m), but wait, no. Wait, actually, if m and n are coprime with m*n=2102, then since m and n are coprime, and their product is a square, then both m and n must be squares. Therefore, m = k2, n = l2, with k*l =210, and gcd(k, l)=1. Therefore, the number of possible m's is equal to the number of squares of positive integers k, where k is a divisor of 210, gcd(k, 210/k)=1, and k < 210/k. Wait, no. Let's think again. If m = k2 and n = l2, then since m*n=2102, we have k2 * l2=2102, so (k*l)^2=2102, so k*l=210, and gcd(k,l)=1. So m = k2 where k is a positive integer such that k divides 210, and gcd(k, 210/k)=1, and k < 210/k (since m <n). So the number of such k is equal to the number of pairs (k, l) with k*l=210, gcd(k,l)=1, and k < l. Therefore, similar to before, k must be a divisor of 210, coprime with l=210/k, hence gcd(k, l)=1. So same as gcd(k, 210/k)=1, which implies gcd(k,210)=1. Wait, but earlier we saw that even if k is not coprime with 210, but when l=210/k, gcd(k,l)=1, which is possible. For example, k=2, l=105. gcd(2,105)=1, but gcd(2,210)=2. So in this case, gcd(k, 210)=k, which is not 1. So, the condition is gcd(k, l)=1, which given l=210/k, is equivalent to gcd(k, 210)=k. Wait, let's see. If gcd(k,210)=d, then d divides k. Then since l=210/k, then gcd(k,l)= gcd(k, 210/k)= d/k. But since d divides k, d/k is an integer only if k divides d. But since d divides k, this would mean k=d. Therefore, if gcd(k,210)=d, then gcd(k, l)=d/k. So if gcd(k, l)=1, then d/k=1, hence d=k. Therefore, gcd(k,210)=k, which implies that k divides 210, and gcd(210/k, k)=1. But gcd(k,210/k)=1 if and only if gcd(k,210)=k. Since gcd(k,210/k)= gcd(k, 210)/k. Therefore, if gcd(k,210)=k, then gcd(k,210/k)= gcd(k, 210)/k =1. Therefore, the condition is that gcd(k,210)=k, which is equivalent to k dividing 210 and for every prime p dividing k, p also divides 210. But since k divides 210, primes of k must be among primes of 210. So this is always true. Wait, but that would mean gcd(k,210)=k means that k divides 210 and k is composed only of primes dividing 210, which is redundant. So perhaps my reasoning is incorrect. Let me take an example. Take k=6. Then l=210/6=35. gcd(6,35)=1. gcd(6,210)=6. So in this case, gcd(k,210)=k. Take k=10. l=21. gcd(10,21)=1. gcd(10,210)=10=k. Similarly, k=14. l=15. gcd(14,15)=1. gcd(14,210)=14. So in these cases, gcd(k,210)=k. However, take k=2. l=1

okay, let's see. i need to solve this problem where a and b are positive integers with gcd(a, b) = 210, lcm[a, b] = 2103, and a < b. the question is asking how many possible values there are for a. hmm, okay.
first, i remember that there's a relationship between gcd and lcm of two numbers.
specifically, for any two positive integers a and b, the product of their gcd and lcm is equal to the product of the numbers themselves.
so, gcd(a, b) * lcm[a, b] = a * b.
let's think in parallel.

1: the formula gcd(a,b) * lcm(a,b) = a * b is verified using the example where a=6 and b=15. for these values, gcd(6,15)=3 and lcm(6,15)=30. the product of gcd and lcm is 3*30=90, which equals the product of a and b (6*15=90), confirming the formula's validity.
</path>
<path>
2: applying the formula with the given values, the product of a and b is calculated as 210 * (210^3), which simplifies to 210^4.
</path>
<conclusion>
the formula gcd(a,b) * lcm(a,b) = a * b was confirmed using a numerical example, and the product of a and b was determined to be 210^4 using this formula and the given values.

so, a * b = 210^4.
given that, and we also know that gcd(a, b) = 210.

1: the numbers a and b can be expressed in terms of their gcd. since gcd(a, b) = 210, both a and b must be multiples of 210. let's denote a = 210 * m and b = 210 * n, where m and n are positive integers. the condition that gcd(a, b) = 210 implies that gcd(m, n) must be 1, because if m and n had a common divisor d > 1, then gcd(a, b) would be 210 * d, which contradicts the given gcd(a, b) = 210.
</path>
<path>
2: the product of m and n is calculated. the product a*b is equal to (210m)*(210n), which simplifies to 210^2 * mn. this product is also given as 210^4. equating these expressions (210^2 * mn = 210^4) shows that mn must be equal to 210^2, as 210^2 * mn = 210^4 implies mn = 210^2.
</path>
<conclusion>
the numbers a and b were factored as 210m and 210n with gcd(m,n)=1, and the product of m and n was determined to be 210^2.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
therefore, m and n are coprime positive integers such that m * n = 2102, and a < b implies that 210m < 210n, so m < n.
therefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of possible values for m, where m and n are coprime integers, m * n = 2102, and m < n. the number of such m's is equal to half the number of ordered pairs (m, n) with m * n = 2102 and gcd(m, n) = 1. but if the divisors m and n are coprime and m * n = 2102, that means that m and n are squares of divisors of 210, right? wait, maybe not squares. let's think again.

if m and n are coprime and multiply to 2102, then each prime in the factorization must go entirely to m or entirely to n. since the exponents in 2102 are all 2's, each prime factor (2, 3, 5, 7) must be given entirely to one of m or n. therefore, for each prime factor, we can assign it to either m or n, but not both.
therefore, the number of such pairs (m, n) is 2^4 = 16, since there are 4 prime factors, and each can be assigned to m or n independently.
however, since m and n are ordered and m < n, we need to divide by 2 to account for the fact that each unordered pair is counted twice, except when m = n, but in our case m ≠ n because gcd(m, n) = 1 and m * n is a square, so m ≠ n. wait, but 2102 is a square. if m and n are coprime and m * n = k2, then m and n must both be squares? wait, no. wait, if m and n are coprime and m * n = k2, then m and n are squares, but only if m and n are coprime. hmm, actually, yes. let me recall that theorem. if two coprime numbers multiply to a square, then each is a square. so indeed, since m and n are coprime and m * n = (210)2, then m and n must be perfect squares. so m = s2, n = t2, with s and t positive integers, s * t = 210, and gcd(s, t) = 1. so perhaps another way to think about it is that first we need to find the number of square divisors m2 of 2102 such that m2 < n2, where n2 = 2102 / m2. but since m and n would be the square roots, s and t as coprime integers. hmm.
alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think about the prime factors. since m and n are coprime and m * n = 2102, then each prime factor must go to either m or n. so for each prime factor in 210 (which are 2, 3, 5, 7), we can assign them to either m or n. therefore, the number of possible assignments is 2^4 = 16, as each prime is independent. however, since m < n, the assignments where primes are assigned to m or to n would result in different values, but we have to consider the order. since m and n are distinct (because m * n is a square of a number, 2102, but m and n are coprime, so m ≠ n), then half of these assignments would have m < n and the other half n < m. therefore, the number of such pairs (m, n) with m < n is 2^4 / 2 = 2^3 = 8.
wait, but 2^4 is 16, divided by 2 would be 8? but that seems too low. let's check.
wait, 2102 is 22 * 32 * 52 * 72. the number of square-free divisors would not be the same as the number of ways to assign primes to m or n. wait, but since m and n are products of primes, each prime either in m or in n, then m is the product of primes assigned to m, and n is the product of primes assigned to n. however, m and n here would be square-free? wait, no. wait, no, because each prime exponent in 2102 is 2. so, if m gets a prime, it gets both copies of the prime (since the prime's square is assigned to m), so m would be a square. so m and n are actually squares of square-free numbers. wait, maybe m is the square of the product of assigned primes. let me clarify. for example, for each prime p in {2,3,5,7}, we decide whether to include both p's in m2 or both in n2. then m2 is the product of the squares of the primes assigned to m, and similarly for n2. therefore, each such assignment corresponds to a pair (m2, n2) where m and n are square-free numbers (products of distinct primes), squared. so m2 = (2 * 3 * 5 * 7)^2, but no, depending on assignments. for instance, if i assign 2 and 3 to m, and 5 and 7 to n, then m2 = (2*3)^2 = 62 and n2 = (5*7)^2 = 352, but then m2 * n2 = (2*3*5*7)^2 = 2102. wait, but in that case, m and n (the square roots) would be 6 and 35, so m * n = 6*35=210, but the actual m2 * n2 is (62)*(352) = (210)^2. wait, but the original problem has a*b = 210^4, so the m and n here (the square roots) would satisfy m * n = 210. wait, maybe i need to adjust. wait, let's clarify. if a = 210 * m and b = 210 * n, with gcd(m, n)=1, then ab = 2102 * m*n = 210^4, so m*n = 2102. so m and n are coprime integers such that m*n = 2102. so m and n must be squares of coprime integers, since their product is a square. let's let m = k2 and n = l2, where k and l are coprime and k*l = 210. therefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of possible k such that k < l, with k*l = 210 and gcd(k, l) = 1. so now, we need to find the number of coprime pairs (k, l) where k*l = 210, and k < l. so the number of such k's would be the number of divisors k of 210, such that gcd(k, 210/k) = 1, and k < 210/k. which simplifies to k^2 < 210. therefore, k is a divisor of 210, k and 210/k are coprime, and k2 < 210. wait, but if k and 210/k are coprime, that's equivalent to gcd(k, 210/k) = 1, which is the same as gcd(k, 210) = 1, since any divisor k of 210 satisfies 210/k is an integer, and gcd(k, 210/k) = gcd(k, 210/ k) = gcd(k, 210)/k. wait, maybe not the best way. let's see. if k is a divisor of 210, then 210 = k * m, where m = 210/k. so if gcd(k, m) = 1, then k and m are coprime divisors of 210. so the problem reduces to finding the number of divisors k of 210 such that k and 210/k are coprime, and k < 210/k. which is the same as finding the number of divisors k of 210 where gcd(k, 210/k) = 1, hence gcd(k, 210) = 1. because if gcd(k, 210) = d >1, then since 210/k = m, then gcd(k, m) = d >1. but we need gcd(k, m) =1, so that implies gcd(k, 210) =1. wait, but 210/k is an integer only if k is a divisor of 210. so, if k is a divisor of 210 and m = 210/k, then gcd(k, m) = gcd(k, 210/k). if d = gcd(k, m), then d divides k and m = 210/k, so d divides k and 210/k. then d divides gcd(k, 210/k) = gcd(k, 210)/k. wait, maybe i need to recall that gcd(k, m) = gcd(k, 210/k) = gcd(k, 210)/k. hmm, not sure. alternatively, suppose that d = gcd(k, m), then d divides k and m, so d divides 210. let k = d * k' and m = d * m', so then 210 = k * m = d * k' * d * m' = d2 * k' * m'. therefore, d2 divides 210, so d must be a divisor of sqrt(210), but since 210 is square-free (its prime factors are distinct primes 2,3,5,7, all exponent 1), so d must be 1. therefore, gcd(k, m) =1 if and only if gcd(k, 210) =1. because if gcd(k,210)=d>1, then since m=210/k, then d divides k and 210, hence d divides m as well, so gcd(k,m)=d>1. contradiction. therefore, for gcd(k, m)=1, we must have gcd(k, 210)=1. but wait, if k divides 210 and gcd(k, 210)=1, then k must be 1. but that would mean m=210, which is greater than k=1. so, the only such divisor is k=1? wait, that doesn't seem right. wait, let's take an example. let's take k=2, which is a prime divisor of 210. then m=210/2=105. are 2 and 105 coprime? well, 105 is divisible by 5 and 7, which 2 is prime, so yes, gcd(2,105)=1. similarly, take k=3. then m=70. gcd(3,70)=1. similarly, k=5, m=42. gcd(5,42)=1. k=7, m=30. gcd(7,30)=1. so, in fact, if k is a prime divisor of 210 (2,3,5,7), then m=210/k is coprime to k, even though k divides 210. wait, so in these cases, gcd(k,210) is k, which is greater than 1, but gcd(k, m)=1. so my previous reasoning is wrong. so, in fact, the key is that k and m=210/k are coprime. so given k is a divisor of 210, what conditions must k satisfy so that gcd(k, 210/k) =1. which is equivalent to saying that there is no prime p such that p divides k and p divides 210/k. since k divides 210, let's write 210 = k * m. if a prime p divides k and 210/k = m, then p divides both k and m, hence p divides gcd(k, m). but we need gcd(k, m)=1. therefore, there should be no prime dividing both k and m. but since k divides 210, and m=210/k, then if there is a prime p dividing k, then p divides 210, but p must not divide m. since m=210/k, then 210 = k * m. so if p divides k, and p divides 210, then p divides 210 but p should not divide m. but since 210 = k * m, and p divides k, then p divides 210. if p divides m, then p divides gcd(k, m). so to ensure that gcd(k, m)=1, we need that for every prime p in k, p does not divide m. but since 210 = k * m, the prime factors of k and m must together be the prime factors of 210. since 210 is square-free, each prime is in either k or m. therefore, k can be any subset of the prime factors of 210. so each k is a product of a subset of {2,3,5,7}, and m is the product of the complementary subset. therefore, since 210 has 4 prime factors, the number of such divisors k is 2^4 =16. each pair (k, m) is just a pair of complementary divisors. however, since we have k < m, which is equivalent to k < 210/k, or k2 < 210. so we need to find the number of divisors k of 210 where k2 < 210. since 210 is 2*3*5*7=210, so 210=210, so sqrt(210) approx 14.49. so k must be less than 14.49. the divisors k of 210 are 1,2,3,5,6,7,10,14,15,21,30,35,42,50,70,105,210. let's list them and see which are less than sqrt(210)≈14.49. so the divisors less than 14.49 are: 1,2,3,5,6,7,10,14. 1: 1*210=210, gcd(1,210)=1: valid. 2:2*105=210, gcd(2,105)=1: valid. 3:3*70, gcd(3,70)=1: valid. 5:5*42, gcd(5,42)=1: valid. 6:6*35, gcd(6,35)=1: 6=2*3, 35=5*7; no common factors: valid. 7:7*30, gcd(7,30)=1: valid. 10:10*21, gcd(10,21)=1: 10=2*5, 21=3*7: valid. 14:14*15, gcd(14,15)=1: 14=2*7,15=3*5: valid. so all these divisors (1,2,3,5,6,7,10,14) when paired with their complementary divisors (210,105,70,42,35,30,21,15) have gcd 1, and the pairs are coprime. so there are 8 such k's where k < m. therefore, there are 8 possible values for m (since each k corresponds to m = k and n =210/k), but wait, no. wait, in terms of the original problem, m and n are squares. wait, hold on. wait, i might have confused variables here. let me recap. originally, we have a = 210m, b=210n, where m and n are coprime and m*n = 2102. so m and n are squares of coprime integers s and t where s*t=210. wait, but maybe not. wait, if m and n are squares and coprime, then m = s2 and n = t2, with s and t coprime and s*t =210. because m*n = s2 * t2 = (st)^2 = 2102 => st=210. so since m and n are squares of coprime numbers s and t, then the number of possible m's is equal to the number of ways to write 210 as a product of two coprime positive integers s and t, with s < t. since s and t are coprime, and order matters such that s < t. so, how many such pairs (s, t) are there with s < t and st =210. but since s and t must be coprime, and st=210, this is equivalent to finding the number of ordered pairs (s, t) where s divides 210, t=210/s, gcd(s, t)=1, and s < t. which is exactly the same as before. so similar to earlier, 210 is square-free (exponents of primes are all 1), so the coprime pairs (s, t) with st=210 correspond to splitting the prime factors of 210 into two sets, each forming s and t. since s and t must be coprime, each prime factor goes either to s or to t. thus, the number of such unordered pairs is 2^(4 -1) = 2^3 =8? wait, no. wait, for each prime factor, we can assign it to s or t. so for 4 prime factors, there are 2^4=16 possible assignments. however, since st=210, s and t are ordered. but since we need coprime pairs (s, t) with s < t, and st=210, the number of such pairs is half the number of coprime ordered pairs (s, t) with st=210. but since each assignment of primes to s or t gives a unique coprime pair (s, t) because all primes are assigned to one or the other. so the number of ordered coprime pairs (s, t) with st=210 is 2^4=16. but since s and t are determined by which primes they get assigned. however, since 210 is square-free, each s corresponds to a unique subset of the primes, and t is the complement. so to get s < t, since s and t are complementary in the primes, then for each such unordered pair, there are two ordered pairs (s, t) and (t, s). except when s = t, but since 210 is square-free, s = t only if 210 is a square, which it isn't. therefore, the number of ordered pairs (s, t) with s < t, st=210, and gcd(s, t)=1 is 2^(4 -1) = 8? wait, 4 primes, each assigned to s or t, but considering order and s < t, so the number of unordered pairs is 2^(4 -1) = 8? wait, actually, the formula for the number of unordered coprime pairs with product n is 2^(ω(n) -1), where ω(n) is the number of distinct prime factors. since n=210 has ω(210)=4, so 2^(4 -1) = 8. therefore, there are 8 unordered pairs. therefore, 8 possible values for s (since each unordered pair (s, t) corresponds to one s where s < t). therefore, the number of possible m's is 8, since each s corresponds to m = s2. therefore, the number of possible values for a is 8. but let's verify this by listing all coprime pairs (s, t) with st=210 and s < t. the prime factors of 210 are 2,3,5,7. assign each prime to s or t. possible assignments: 1. assign 2 to s, 3,5,7 to t: s=2, t=3*5*7=105. check (2,105). gcd(2,105)=1? yes. 2. assign 3 to s, 2,5,7 to t: s=3, t=2*5*7=70. (3,70). gcd=1. yes. 3. assign 5 to s, 2,3,7 to t: s=5, t=2*3*7=42. (5,42). yes. 4. assign 7 to s, 2,3,5 to t: s=7, t=2*3*5=30. (7,30). yes. 5. assign 2 and 3 to s, 5,7 to t: s=2*3=6, t=5*7=35. (6,35). gcd=1. yes. 6. assign 2 and 5 to s, 3,7 to t: s=2*5=10, t=3*7=21. (10,21). yes. 7. assign 2 and 7 to s,3 and5 to t: s=2*7=14, t=3*5=15. (14,15). yes. 8. assign 3 and 5 to s, 2 and7 to t: s=3*5=15, t=2*7=14. but this would be (15,14), but s < t, so this is already covered in the previous case where s=14, t=15. similarly, assignments of three primes to s would result in s > t. so the possible coprime pairs (s, t) with s < t are exactly the 8 pairs listed above: (2,105), (3,70), (5,42), (6,35), (7,30), (10,21), (14,15). wait, that's 7 pairs. wait, but earlier reasoning suggested 8. wait, perhaps i missed one. let's recount. assign primes: 1. assign 2 to s: s=2, t=3*5*7=105. (2,105). 2. assign 3 to s: s=3, t=2*5*7=70. (3,70). 3. assign 5 to s: s=5, t=2*3*7=42. (5,42). 4. assign 7 to s: s=7, t=2*3*5=30. (7,30). 5. assign 2 and 3 to s: s=6, t=5*7=35. (6,35). 6. assign 2 and 5 to s: s=10, t=3*7=21. (10,21). 7. assign 2 and 7 to s: s=14, t=3*5=15. (14,15). 8. assign 3 and 5 to s: s=15, t=2*7=14. but s=15 < t=14? no, so this would be (14,15) again. wait, but 3 and 5 assigned to s, which would require t=2 and 7. so s=15, t=14. since s=15 < t=14 is not true, so this is invalid. so perhaps only 7 pairs? wait, where is the 8th pair? wait, maybe assigning 3 and 7: s=21, t=2*5=10. (10,21) is already considered as s=10, t=21. similarly, assigning 5 and 7: s=35, t=2*3=6. (6,35) already considered. assigning 2,3,5 to s: s=30, t=7. but s=30 > t=7, so not applicable. assigning 2,3,7 to s: s=42, t=5. s=42 > t=5. similarly, assigning 2,5,7: s=70, t=3. assigning 3,5,7: s=105, t=2. so, in all, the unique (s, t) pairs with s < t are indeed the 7 pairs listed. but earlier thought process suggested 8. so, where is the 8th pair? wait, maybe i made a mistake. let's check again. the prime factors are 2,3,5,7. how many ways can we split them into two coprime parts where the order matters (s < t). but in splitting the primes into two sets, each assignment corresponds to a unique factorization into coprime s and t. for each subset a of the primes, s is the product of primes in a, t is the product of primes not in a. since st=210, to have s < t, the subset a must have product s < t=210/s, so s2 < 210. so same as previous reasoning. so s must be a product of some subset of primes, such that s2 <210. the possible square factors m would be s2 where s is a product of a subset and s2 <210. let's compute: possible s values (product of subsets): 1. s=1: m=1^2=1. 2. s=2: m=4. 3. s=3: m=9. 4. s=5: m=25. 5. s=7: m=49. 6. s=2*3=6: m=36. 7. s=2*5=10: m=100. 8. s=2*7=14: m=196. 9. s=3*5=15: m=225. but 152=225 >210, so m=225 is invalid. similarly, other combinations: s=3*7=21: 212=441 too big. s=5*7=35:352=1225 too big. s=2*3*5=30:900 too big. etc. so the valid s's where s2 <210 are: s=1,2,3,5,6,7,10,14. so their squares are: 1,4,9,25,36,49,100,196. these are 8 values. but wait, in the initial pairing where m and n are coprime and m*n=2102, then a=210*sqrt(m), but wait, no. wait, actually, if m and n are coprime with m*n=2102, then since m and n are coprime, and their product is a square, then both m and n must be squares. therefore, m = k2, n = l2, with k*l =210, and gcd(k, l)=1. therefore, the number of possible m's is equal to the number of squares of positive integers k, where k is a divisor of 210, gcd(k, 210/k)=1, and k < 210/k. wait, no. let's think again. if m = k2 and n = l2, then since m*n=2102, we have k2 * l2=2102, so (k*l)^2=2102, so k*l=210, and gcd(k,l)=1. so m = k2 where k is a positive integer such that k divides 210, and gcd(k, 210/k)=1, and k < 210/k (since m <n). so the number of such k is equal to the number of pairs (k, l) with k*l=210, gcd(k,l)=1, and k < l. therefore, similar to before, k must be a divisor of 210, coprime with l=210/k, hence gcd(k, l)=1. so same as gcd(k, 210/k)=1, which implies gcd(k,210)=1. wait, but earlier we saw that even if k is not coprime with 210, but when l=210/k, gcd(k,l)=1, which is possible. for example, k=2, l=105. gcd(2,105)=1, but gcd(2,210)=2. so in this case, gcd(k, 210)=k, which is not 1. so, the condition is gcd(k, l)=1, which given l=210/k, is equivalent to gcd(k, 210)=k. wait, let's see. if gcd(k,210)=d, then d divides k. then since l=210/k, then gcd(k,l)= gcd(k, 210/k)= d/k. but since d divides k, d/k is an integer only if k divides d. but since d divides k, this would mean k=d. therefore, if gcd(k,210)=d, then gcd(k, l)=d/k. so if gcd(k, l)=1, then d/k=1, hence d=k. therefore, gcd(k,210)=k, which implies that k divides 210, and gcd(210/k, k)=1. but gcd(k,210/k)=1 if and only if gcd(k,210)=k. since gcd(k,210/k)= gcd(k, 210)/k. therefore, if gcd(k,210)=k, then gcd(k,210/k)= gcd(k, 210)/k =1. therefore, the condition is that gcd(k,210)=k, which is equivalent to k dividing 210 and for every prime p dividing k, p also divides 210. but since k divides 210, primes of k must be among primes of 210. so this is always true. wait, but that would mean gcd(k,210)=k means that k divides 210 and k is composed only of primes dividing 210, which is redundant. so perhaps my reasoning is incorrect. let me take an example. take k=6. then l=210/6=35. gcd(6,35)=1. gcd(6,210)=6. so in this case, gcd(k,210)=k. take k=10. l=21. gcd(10,21)=1. gcd(10,210)=10=k. similarly, k=14. l=15. gcd(14,15)=1. gcd(14,210)=14. so in these cases, gcd(k,210)=k. however, take k=2. l=1
