Okay, so I need to solve this problem where I have two positive integers a and b. Their gcd is 210, and their lcm is 210 cubed. Also, a is less than b, and I need to find how many possible values there are for a. Hmm, let me recall the relationship between gcd and lcm for two numbers. I remember that the product of two numbers is equal to the product of their gcd and lcm. So, that would mean a * b = gcd(a,b) * lcm(a,b). Here, gcd(a,b) is 210, and lcm(a,b) is 2103. Therefore, a * b = 210 * 2103 = 2104. Since their gcd is 210, I can express a and b as multiples of 210. Let me write a = 210 * m and b = 210 * n, where m and n are positive integers. Then, substituting into the product, we get (210*m) * (210*n) = 2104. That simplifies to 2102 * m * n = 2104, which implies that m * n = 2102. But we also know that gcd(a,b) = 210, which when expressed in terms of m and n would be gcd(210m, 210n) = 210 * gcd(m,n). Since gcd(a,b) is given as 210, that means gcd(m,n) = 1. So m and n must be coprime positive integers. Also, since a < b, then 210m < 210n, so m < n. So, the problem reduces to finding the number of pairs (m,n) where m and n are coprime positive integers, m < n, and m * n = 2102. Therefore, the problem becomes finding the number of divisors m of 2102 such that m and 2102/m are coprime and m < 2102/m. Wait, if m and n are coprime and m * n = 2102, then each such pair corresponds to a unique way of writing 2102 as a product of two coprime numbers m and n with m < n. I recall that the number of such pairs is equal to 2^{k-1}, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of the number. But wait, 2102 would have prime factors. Let me check. First, factorize 210. 210 = 2 * 3 * 5 * 7. Therefore, 2102 = (2 * 3 * 5 * 7)2 = 22 * 32 * 52 * 72. So, the prime factors are 2, 3, 5, 7, each squared. So, 2102 is 22 * 32 * 52 * 72. Now, when we want to split 2102 into two coprime factors m and n, each prime exponent must go entirely to one factor or the other. Since m and n need to be coprime, for each prime factor, it must divide either m or n but not both. Therefore, each prime factor's exponent in 2102 (which is 2 for each prime) can be assigned to m or n. So, for each prime factor, we have two choices: assign it to m or assign it to n. But since m and n must multiply to 2102, once we assign a prime's exponent to m or n, the other factor will get the remaining exponent. Since the total exponent for each prime is 2, assigning them all to m would make n have exponent 0, which corresponds to m = 2^{2} * 3^{2} * 5^{2} * 7^{2} and n = 1, but m and n must multiply to 2102. Wait, but if each exponent in the prime factorization of 2102 is 2, then each prime can be given entirely to m or to n, but since m * n = 2102, the exponents in m and n add up. Wait, but the exponents in m and n must be such that for each prime p, p divides m or n but not both (because m and n are coprime). Therefore, each prime must be assigned to either m or n, but not both. So, for each prime factor (2, 3, 5, 7), we have two choices: assign it to m or assign it to n. Therefore, the number of ways to assign the primes is 2^4 = 16. However, this counts each pair (m,n) and (n,m) as separate, but since we have m < n, we need to divide by 2, which would give 16 / 2 = 8. But wait, that would be if the pairs are distinct. However, since m and n are unique and m < n, perhaps each assignment where a particular prime is assigned to m or n would result in m < n or not? Wait, no. If we consider that for each prime factor, the assignment to m or n affects the product m and n. If m is assigned more primes, m will be larger, and n will be smaller. So, to have m < n, the number of prime factors assigned to m must be less than the number assigned to n. Wait, but since m and n are products of squares of primes. Wait, perhaps another way: Each prime factor 2, 3, 5, 7 can be given entirely to m or to n. So, m and n will each be a product of some of the primes squared. For example, m could be 22, and n would be 32*52*72. Then m < n? Let's see: 4 < (3*5*7)^2. Since 3*5*7 = 105, 105^2 = 11025, so 4 < 11025. Yes. Similarly, if m is 22*32 and n is 52*72. Then m = 4*9=36, n = 25*49=1225. 36 < 1225, yes. Similarly, if m is 22*32*52 and n is 72. Then m = 4*9*25=900, n=49. 900 < 49? No. So in that case, m and n would need to be swapped to satisfy m < n. Wait, so maybe the assignment of primes to m or n has to result in m < n. So if I assign more primes to m, it becomes larger, or if I assign more to n, m becomes smaller. So, to get m < n, we need the product assigned to m to be less than the product assigned to n. So, the key is to count the number of subsets S of the set of prime factors {2,3,5,7} such that the product of primes in S squared is less than the product of the remaining primes squared. But since the primes are squared, the product m would be (Π_{p ∈ S} p)^2, and n would be (Π_{p ∉ S} p)^2. So, m < n implies that (Π_{p ∈ S} p)^2 < (Π_{p ∉ S} p)^2, which implies that Π_{p ∈ S} p < Π_{p ∉ S} p. So, we need the product of primes in S to be less than the product of primes not in S. Since all primes here are distinct primes 2,3,5,7. Let's compute the total product, which is 2*3*5*7 = 210. So, if S is a subset of these primes, then the product of primes in S times the product of primes not in S is 210. So, if P = product of primes in S, then the product of primes not in S is 210 / P. So, the condition is P < 210 / P, which implies P2 < 210. Therefore, P < sqrt(210). Since sqrt(210) is approximately 14.49. Therefore, P must be less than 14.49. So, the product of the primes in S must be less than 14.5. Since all primes are integers, the product P must be an integer less than 15. So, possible products P can be 2,3,5,7 (individual primes), then pairs: 2*3=6, 2*5=10, 2*7=14, 3*5=15. Wait, but 3*5=15 is equal to 15, which is the threshold. However, the inequality is P < sqrt(210), which is approximately 14.49. So 15 is over the limit. So pairs where product exceeds 14.49 would be 3*5=15, which is too big. Similarly, triple products are 2*3*5=30, which is way over. So, possible subsets S are: - Single primes: 2,3,5,7. Their products are 2,3,5,7, each less than 14.49. So these are 4 subsets. - Pairs: 2*3=6, 2*5=10, 2*7=14, 3*5=15 (excluded), 3*7=21 (excluded), 5*7=35 (excluded). So only pairs with products 6,10,14 are allowed. That's three more subsets. - Triple products: as mentioned, even the smallest triple product is 2*3*5=30, which is over 14.49, so all triples are excluded. - The quadruple product is 2*3*5*7=210, which is way over. - The empty subset S: product P=1. Then n's product would be 210 /1 =210. Since 1 < 210, that's also a valid subset. So, the empty set and all subsets S where the product is less than sqrt(210). Therefore, total subsets S that satisfy P < sqrt(210) are: - The empty set (P=1) - Single prime sets (4 subsets) - Pairs of primes with products <=14: which are {2,3}, {2,5}, {2,7}. So three subsets. - Any other subsets would have higher products. So total subsets: 1 (empty) + 4 (single) + 3 (pairs) = 8 subsets. Therefore, the number of valid subsets S is 8, each defining a pair (m,n) with m < n. Therefore, the number of possible values for a is 8. But wait, let me check this again. Let's list all possible subsets S of {2,3,5,7} such that the product of primes in S is less than sqrt(210) ≈14.49. 1. S = {} (product 1 < 14.49: valid) 2. S = {2} (product 2 <14.49: valid) 3. S = {3} (3 <14.49: valid) 4. S = {5} (5 <14.49: valid) 5. S = {7} (7 <14.49: valid) 6. S = {2,3} (product 6 <14.49: valid) 7. S = {2,5} (10 <14.49: valid) 8. S = {2,7} (14 <14.49: valid) 9. S = {3,5} (15 >14.49: invalid) 10. S = {3,7} (21 >14.49: invalid) 11. S = {5,7} (35 >14.49: invalid) Subsets with three or more primes: products too big. So yes, subsets 1-8 are valid, totaling 8 subsets. Therefore, the number of possible a's is 8. But wait, let's confirm this by another approach. Since a = 210 * m, and m is a divisor of 2102 with m and 2102/m being coprime, and m < 2102/m. Therefore, m must be a product of some primes (each to the power of 0 or 2?), but wait. Wait, m and 2102/m are coprime only if m is a product of primes to some exponents, but since 2102 is the square of square-free part 210, actually, no. Wait, 2102 is (2*3*5*7)^2 = 22*32*52*72. So, m must be a divisor of 2102, which is 22*32*52*72. So m can be written as 2^{a}3^{b}5^{c}7^{d}, where 0 <= a, b, c, d <=2. But since m and 2102/m must be coprime. If m is such that if a prime is in m, then in 2102/m, the corresponding prime's exponent would be 2 - a. However, if m and 2102/m are coprime, that would require that for each prime p, if p divides m, then p does not divide 2102/m. But since 2102/m = 2^{2-a}3^{2-b}5^{2-c}7^{2-d}, that would mean that for each prime p, if p divides m (so a, b, c, d >=1), then in 2102/m, the exponent of p is 2 - exponent, which is non-negative. But if the exponent of p in m is greater than 0, then to have p not divide 2102/m, the exponent in 2102/m must be 0. That can only happen if 2 - a_p = 0, i.e., a_p = 2. Therefore, for m and 2102/m to be coprime, m must be a product of squares of primes. That is, m must be squareful for each prime power in its factorization. Wait, but primes can only be included in m if they are squared. Wait, if p divides m and m is such that p does not divide 2102/m. Since 2102/m = (2*3*5*7)^2 / m. If m contains p^2, then 2102/m would have p-exponent 2 - 2 = 0. Therefore, yes, m must be a product of squares of primes from the set {2,3,5,7}. Therefore, m can be written as (2^e1 * 3^e2 * 5^e3 *7^e4)^2, but since 2102 is (2*3*5*7)^2, the only possibilities for m are products of these primes either squared or not? Wait, no, m must be a subset of the primes {2,3,5,7} squared. So, m can be 1 (if no primes are chosen), each prime squared, products of two distinct primes squared, etc., up to all primes squared. Wait, but if m is allowed to be a product of primes squared, then m and n would be coprime because they don't share any prime factors. So, m is a product of some subset of the primes {2,3,5,7}, each squared. So, m can be written as (P)^2 where P is a product of primes from {2,3,5,7}. Then n would be (2*3*5*7)^2 / m = (2*3*5*7 / P)^2. So, m and n are squares of integers, coprime, and m*n=2102. Therefore, the number of such m is equal to the number of subsets of {2,3,5,7}, which is 2^4=16. However, since m < n, we must have m < 2102/m, which implies m2 < 2102, so m < 210. Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of m which are squares of square-free numbers (since m is square of product of distinct primes) and m <210. But wait, m is a square. The square root of m must be a square-free integer (product of distinct primes from {2,3,5,7}). So sqrt(m) is a square-free positive integer made from the primes 2,3,5,7. Therefore, sqrt(m) can be any subset of {2,3,5,7} multiplied together (including 1). Then m is (subset product)^2. To have m < n, since m * n =2102, m < n implies m2 < 2102, so m <210. Therefore, sqrt(m) must be less than 210^(1/2) = sqrt(210) ≈14.49. Therefore, the product of primes in the subset (which is sqrt(m)) must be less than14.5. Therefore, subsets of {2,3,5,7} with product less than14.5. Let's list them: All subsets S of {2,3,5,7} where product of elements is <14.5. 1. {} -> product 1 (<14.5) 2. {2} -> 2 3. {3} ->3 4. {5} ->5 5. {7} ->7 6. {2,3} ->6 7. {2,5} ->10 8. {2,7} ->14 9. {3,5} ->15 (excluded) 10. {3,7} ->21 (excluded) 11. {5,7} ->35 (excluded) 12. {2,3,5} ->30 (excluded) 13. {2,3,7} ->42 (excluded) 14. {2,5,7} ->70 (excluded) 15. {3,5,7} ->105 (excluded) 16. {2,3,5,7} ->210 (excluded) So, the valid subsets S (with product <14.5) are subsets where the product is 1,2,3,5,6,7,10,14. Therefore, the number of such subsets is 8. Therefore, the number of possible m is 8, each corresponding to a unique a =210*m where m is the square of the product of primes in the subset. For example: - For S = {}, m =12=1, a=210*1=210, n=2102/m=2102, which is b=210*210. Check m=1, n=2102. GCD(210, 210*210)=210, LCM is 210*210*210=2103. Yes, that works. - For S={2}, m=22=4, a=210*4, n=2102/4= (210/2)^2=1052=11025, so b=210*11025/210=11025. But wait, b should be 210*n', where n' is 11025/(210). Wait, 210*4 * 210*11025/(210) =210*4 *11025=210^3 *4. Wait, maybe I confused something here. Wait, m and n in the previous steps are m'=m'original and n'=2102/m', such that a=210*sqrt(m'), since m' is a square. Wait, maybe I need to correct this. Wait, actually, m in the equation a=210*m comes from a=210*m, b=210*n, with m*n=2102. But m and n there are not the same as the subsets S. Wait, perhaps I need to clarify. Let me correct: Since a and b are such that gcd(a,b)=210, we can write a=210*m and b=210*n, where gcd(m,n)=1. Then, the lcm of a and b is lcm(a,b)=210*lcm(m,n). But since lcm(a,b)=2103, we have 210*lcm(m,n)=2103 => lcm(m,n)=2102. Since m and n are coprime, lcm(m,n)=m*n. Therefore, m*n=2102. So, m and n are coprime and positive integers with m*n=2102. Since m and n are coprime, they must be square-free? No, 2102 is 22*32*52*72. So, m and n being coprime and multiplying to 2102 implies that each prime exponent in 2102 (which is 2 for each prime) is entirely in m or entirely in n. Therefore, m is of the form (2^{e1}3^{e2}5^{e3}7^{e4}) where each e_i is 0 or 2. Because if a prime is in m, it must be squared, and if not, it's in n. Therefore, m can be written as the product of squares of some subset of the primes {2,3,5,7}. So m is 1, 22, 32, 52,72, (2*3)^2, (2*5)^2, (2*7)^2, (3*5)^2, etc., up to (2*3*5*7)^2. However, since m and n must satisfy m < n, and m *n=2102, then m < 2102/m, which implies m2 <2102, so m <210. Therefore, m must be a divisor of 2102, coprime with n=2102/m, and m <210. Therefore, m is the product of squares of some primes from {2,3,5,7}, so sqrt(m) is the product of some primes from that set. Therefore, sqrt(m) must be less than sqrt(210)= ~14.49. Therefore, sqrt(m) must be an integer (since m is a square) which is the product of some primes (subset of {2,3,5,7}) and less than14.5. Therefore, the possible sqrt(m) are: 1. Product of 0 primes: 1 (but 1 is the product of zero primes). 2. Product of one prime: 2,3,5,7. 3. Product of two primes: 2*3=6, 2*5=10, 2*7=14, 3*5=15 (which is 15>14.49, so excluded). The other two-prime products are also larger: 3*7=21, 5*7=35. So, only two-prime products 6,10,14 are allowed. 4. Product of three primes: all such products are 2*3*5=30, which is too big. So, the possible sqrt(m) are 1,2,3,5,7,6,10,14. Each of these corresponds to m being 1,4,9,25,49,36,100,196. Then m is the square, and a=210*m. So, each of these m's gives a different a. Therefore, the number of possible m's is 8, so the number of possible a's is 8. Therefore, the answer should be 8. But to confirm, let me list them: 1. m=1: a=210*1=210, b=210*2102/1=2103. Check gcd(210,2103)=210, lcm(210,2103)=2103. Correct. 2. m=4: a=210*4, b=210* (2102/4)=210*(1052/4). Wait, 2102=44100, 44100/4=11025. So b=210*11025/210=11025. Check gcd(210*4, 210*11025)=210*gcd(4,11025). Since 11025=5^2*3^2*7^2, gcd(4,11025)=1. So gcd(a,b)=210*1=210, correct. lcm(a,b)=lcm(210*4,210*11025)=210*lcm(4,11025). LCM(4,11025)=11025*4/gcd(4,11025)=44100. Then 210*44100=2103. Correct. 3. m=9: a=210*9, b=210*(2102/9)=210*(44100/9)=210*4900=210*4900. Check gcd(210*9,210*4900)=210*gcd(9,4900). Since 4900=2^2*5^2*7^2, gcd(9,4900)=1. So gcd(a,b)=210. LCM(a,b)=210*LCM(9,4900)=210*(9*4900)=210*44100=2103. Correct. 4. m=25: Similarly, a=210*25, b=210*(2102/25)=210*1764. Check gcd(210*25,210*1764)=210* gcd(25,1764). Since 1764=2^2*3^2*7^2, gcd(25,1764)=1. So gcd(a,b)=210. LCM(a,b)=210*LCM(25,1764)=210*(25*1764/ gcd(25,1764))=210*25*1764/1=210*44100=2103. Correct. 5. m=49: a=210*49, b=210*(2102/49)=210*44100/49=210*900=189000. Check gcd(210*49,189000)=210* gcd(49,900). GCD(49,900)=1. So gcd(a,b)=210. LCM(a,b)=210*LCM(49,900)=210*(49*900)=210*44100=2103. Correct. 6. m=36: a=210*36, b=210*(2102/36)=210*1225. Check gcd(210*36,210*1225)=210*gcd(36,1225). Since 1225=52*72, gcd(36,1225)=1. So gcd(a,b)=210. LCM(a,b)=210*LCM(36,1225)=210*(36*1225)=210*44100=2103. Correct. 7. m=100: a=210*100, b=210*(2102/100)=210*441*210/10=210*441*21. Wait, 2102/100= (210/10)^2=212=441. So b=210*441=92610. Check gcd(210*100,210*441)=210* gcd(100,441). Since 441=212=32*72, gcd(100,441)=1. So gcd(a,b)=210. LCM(a,b)=210*LCM(100,441)=210*(100*441/ gcd(100,441))=210*100*441=210*44100=2103. Correct. 8. m=196: a=210*196, b=210*(2102/196)=210*(44100/196)=210*225. Check gcd(210*196,210*225)=210*gcd(196,225). Since 196=142, 225=152. Their gcd is 1. So gcd(a,b)=210. LCM(a,b)=210*LCM(196,225)=210*(196*225/1)=210*44100=2103. Correct. So, all these m values satisfy the conditions. Thus, the number of possible a's is 8. Therefore, the answer is 8. But let me check once again. The possible m's are the squares of the products of primes from the set {2,3,5,7} such that the product is less than sqrt(2102)=210. Since sqrt(2102) is 210. But sqrt(m) is the product of primes in S, so that product must be less than sqrt(2102)=210. Wait, but in reality, sqrt(m) < 210. But that would not restrict anything, since the product of primes in S (as sqrt(m)) must be less than 210. However, in the prior analysis, the restriction came from m < n, which translates to m <2102/m, so m2 <2102, so m <210. Therefore, sqrt(m) <sqrt(210). But sqrt(m) is the product of primes in S. Therefore, the product of primes in S (sqrt(m)) must be less than sqrt(210)=~14.49. Therefore, that's where the restriction comes from. So, the maximum product of primes in S is 2*3*5*7=210, but since we need product <14.5. Therefore, only subsets with product up to14. So, the 8 subsets listed earlier. Therefore, the answer is 8. Therefore, the number of possible values for a is 8. So, the final answer is 8.

Answer: Given that \(\gcd(a, b) = 210\) and \(\mathop{\text{lcm}}[a, b] = 210^3\), we start by expressing \(a\) and \(b\) as multiples of their gcd. Let \(a = 210m\) and \(b = 210n\) where \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime positive integers. The product condition \(a \cdot b = \gcd(a, b) \cdot \mathop{\text{lcm}}[a, b]\) gives us:

\[
(210m)(210n) = 210 \cdot 210^3 \implies 210^2 \cdot mn = 210^4 \implies mn = 210^2
\]

Since \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime, they must be such that \(m \cdot n = 210^2\) with \(\gcd(m, n) = 1\). We need to find the number of pairs \((m, n)\) where \(m < n\) and \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime. 

The prime factorization of \(210\) is \(2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7\), so \(210^2 = 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \times 7^2\). Each prime factor must be assigned entirely to \(m\) or \(n\), leading to \(2^4 = 16\) possible assignments. However, since \(m < n\), we only consider pairs where the product of the assigned primes for \(m\) is less than the product for \(n\).

The product of primes assigned to \(m\) must be less than \(\sqrt{210}\) (approximately 14.49). Valid products of primes (less than 14.49) are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, and 14. These correspond to 8 subsets of the prime factors \(\{2, 3, 5, 7\}\).

Thus, there are 8 possible values for \(m\), leading to 8 possible values for \(a = 210m\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{8}\).

okay, so i need to solve this problem where i have two positive integers a and b. their gcd is 210, and their lcm is 210 cubed. also, a is less than b, and i need to find how many possible values there are for a. hmm, let me recall the relationship between gcd and lcm for two numbers. i remember that the product of two numbers is equal to the product of their gcd and lcm. so, that would mean a * b = gcd(a,b) * lcm(a,b). here, gcd(a,b) is 210, and lcm(a,b) is 2103. therefore, a * b = 210 * 2103 = 2104. since their gcd is 210, i can express a and b as multiples of 210. let me write a = 210 * m and b = 210 * n, where m and n are positive integers. then, substituting into the product, we get (210*m) * (210*n) = 2104. that simplifies to 2102 * m * n = 2104, which implies that m * n = 2102. but we also know that gcd(a,b) = 210, which when expressed in terms of m and n would be gcd(210m, 210n) = 210 * gcd(m,n). since gcd(a,b) is given as 210, that means gcd(m,n) = 1. so m and n must be coprime positive integers. also, since a < b, then 210m < 210n, so m < n. so, the problem reduces to finding the number of pairs (m,n) where m and n are coprime positive integers, m < n, and m * n = 2102. therefore, the problem becomes finding the number of divisors m of 2102 such that m and 2102/m are coprime and m < 2102/m. wait, if m and n are coprime and m * n = 2102, then each such pair corresponds to a unique way of writing 2102 as a product of two coprime numbers m and n with m < n. i recall that the number of such pairs is equal to 2^{k-1}, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of the number. but wait, 2102 would have prime factors. let me check. first, factorize 210. 210 = 2 * 3 * 5 * 7. therefore, 2102 = (2 * 3 * 5 * 7)2 = 22 * 32 * 52 * 72. so, the prime factors are 2, 3, 5, 7, each squared. so, 2102 is 22 * 32 * 52 * 72. now, when we want to split 2102 into two coprime factors m and n, each prime exponent must go entirely to one factor or the other. since m and n need to be coprime, for each prime factor, it must divide either m or n but not both. therefore, each prime factor's exponent in 2102 (which is 2 for each prime) can be assigned to m or n. so, for each prime factor, we have two choices: assign it to m or assign it to n. but since m and n must multiply to 2102, once we assign a prime's exponent to m or n, the other factor will get the remaining exponent. since the total exponent for each prime is 2, assigning them all to m would make n have exponent 0, which corresponds to m = 2^{2} * 3^{2} * 5^{2} * 7^{2} and n = 1, but m and n must multiply to 2102. wait, but if each exponent in the prime factorization of 2102 is 2, then each prime can be given entirely to m or to n, but since m * n = 2102, the exponents in m and n add up. wait, but the exponents in m and n must be such that for each prime p, p divides m or n but not both (because m and n are coprime). therefore, each prime must be assigned to either m or n, but not both. so, for each prime factor (2, 3, 5, 7), we have two choices: assign it to m or assign it to n. therefore, the number of ways to assign the primes is 2^4 = 16. however, this counts each pair (m,n) and (n,m) as separate, but since we have m < n, we need to divide by 2, which would give 16 / 2 = 8. but wait, that would be if the pairs are distinct. however, since m and n are unique and m < n, perhaps each assignment where a particular prime is assigned to m or n would result in m < n or not? wait, no. if we consider that for each prime factor, the assignment to m or n affects the product m and n. if m is assigned more primes, m will be larger, and n will be smaller. so, to have m < n, the number of prime factors assigned to m must be less than the number assigned to n. wait, but since m and n are products of squares of primes. wait, perhaps another way: each prime factor 2, 3, 5, 7 can be given entirely to m or to n. so, m and n will each be a product of some of the primes squared. for example, m could be 22, and n would be 32*52*72. then m < n? let's see: 4 < (3*5*7)^2. since 3*5*7 = 105, 105^2 = 11025, so 4 < 11025. yes. similarly, if m is 22*32 and n is 52*72. then m = 4*9=36, n = 25*49=1225. 36 < 1225, yes. similarly, if m is 22*32*52 and n is 72. then m = 4*9*25=900, n=49. 900 < 49? no. so in that case, m and n would need to be swapped to satisfy m < n. wait, so maybe the assignment of primes to m or n has to result in m < n. so if i assign more primes to m, it becomes larger, or if i assign more to n, m becomes smaller. so, to get m < n, we need the product assigned to m to be less than the product assigned to n. so, the key is to count the number of subsets s of the set of prime factors {2,3,5,7} such that the product of primes in s squared is less than the product of the remaining primes squared. but since the primes are squared, the product m would be (π_{p ∈ s} p)^2, and n would be (π_{p ∉ s} p)^2. so, m < n implies that (π_{p ∈ s} p)^2 < (π_{p ∉ s} p)^2, which implies that π_{p ∈ s} p < π_{p ∉ s} p. so, we need the product of primes in s to be less than the product of primes not in s. since all primes here are distinct primes 2,3,5,7. let's compute the total product, which is 2*3*5*7 = 210. so, if s is a subset of these primes, then the product of primes in s times the product of primes not in s is 210. so, if p = product of primes in s, then the product of primes not in s is 210 / p. so, the condition is p < 210 / p, which implies p2 < 210. therefore, p < sqrt(210). since sqrt(210) is approximately 14.49. therefore, p must be less than 14.49. so, the product of the primes in s must be less than 14.5. since all primes are integers, the product p must be an integer less than 15. so, possible products p can be 2,3,5,7 (individual primes), then pairs: 2*3=6, 2*5=10, 2*7=14, 3*5=15. wait, but 3*5=15 is equal to 15, which is the threshold. however, the inequality is p < sqrt(210), which is approximately 14.49. so 15 is over the limit. so pairs where product exceeds 14.49 would be 3*5=15, which is too big. similarly, triple products are 2*3*5=30, which is way over. so, possible subsets s are: - single primes: 2,3,5,7. their products are 2,3,5,7, each less than 14.49. so these are 4 subsets. - pairs: 2*3=6, 2*5=10, 2*7=14, 3*5=15 (excluded), 3*7=21 (excluded), 5*7=35 (excluded). so only pairs with products 6,10,14 are allowed. that's three more subsets. - triple products: as mentioned, even the smallest triple product is 2*3*5=30, which is over 14.49, so all triples are excluded. - the quadruple product is 2*3*5*7=210, which is way over. - the empty subset s: product p=1. then n's product would be 210 /1 =210. since 1 < 210, that's also a valid subset. so, the empty set and all subsets s where the product is less than sqrt(210). therefore, total subsets s that satisfy p < sqrt(210) are: - the empty set (p=1) - single prime sets (4 subsets) - pairs of primes with products <=14: which are {2,3}, {2,5}, {2,7}. so three subsets. - any other subsets would have higher products. so total subsets: 1 (empty) + 4 (single) + 3 (pairs) = 8 subsets. therefore, the number of valid subsets s is 8, each defining a pair (m,n) with m < n. therefore, the number of possible values for a is 8. but wait, let me check this again. let's list all possible subsets s of {2,3,5,7} such that the product of primes in s is less than sqrt(210) ≈14.49. 1. s = {} (product 1 < 14.49: valid) 2. s = {2} (product 2 <14.49: valid) 3. s = {3} (3 <14.49: valid) 4. s = {5} (5 <14.49: valid) 5. s = {7} (7 <14.49: valid) 6. s = {2,3} (product 6 <14.49: valid) 7. s = {2,5} (10 <14.49: valid) 8. s = {2,7} (14 <14.49: valid) 9. s = {3,5} (15 >14.49: invalid) 10. s = {3,7} (21 >14.49: invalid) 11. s = {5,7} (35 >14.49: invalid) subsets with three or more primes: products too big. so yes, subsets 1-8 are valid, totaling 8 subsets. therefore, the number of possible a's is 8. but wait, let's confirm this by another approach. since a = 210 * m, and m is a divisor of 2102 with m and 2102/m being coprime, and m < 2102/m. therefore, m must be a product of some primes (each to the power of 0 or 2?), but wait. wait, m and 2102/m are coprime only if m is a product of primes to some exponents, but since 2102 is the square of square-free part 210, actually, no. wait, 2102 is (2*3*5*7)^2 = 22*32*52*72. so, m must be a divisor of 2102, which is 22*32*52*72. so m can be written as 2^{a}3^{b}5^{c}7^{d}, where 0 <= a, b, c, d <=2. but since m and 2102/m must be coprime. if m is such that if a prime is in m, then in 2102/m, the corresponding prime's exponent would be 2 - a. however, if m and 2102/m are coprime, that would require that for each prime p, if p divides m, then p does not divide 2102/m. but since 2102/m = 2^{2-a}3^{2-b}5^{2-c}7^{2-d}, that would mean that for each prime p, if p divides m (so a, b, c, d >=1), then in 2102/m, the exponent of p is 2 - exponent, which is non-negative. but if the exponent of p in m is greater than 0, then to have p not divide 2102/m, the exponent in 2102/m must be 0. that can only happen if 2 - a_p = 0, i.e., a_p = 2. therefore, for m and 2102/m to be coprime, m must be a product of squares of primes. that is, m must be squareful for each prime power in its factorization. wait, but primes can only be included in m if they are squared. wait, if p divides m and m is such that p does not divide 2102/m. since 2102/m = (2*3*5*7)^2 / m. if m contains p^2, then 2102/m would have p-exponent 2 - 2 = 0. therefore, yes, m must be a product of squares of primes from the set {2,3,5,7}. therefore, m can be written as (2^e1 * 3^e2 * 5^e3 *7^e4)^2, but since 2102 is (2*3*5*7)^2, the only possibilities for m are products of these primes either squared or not? wait, no, m must be a subset of the primes {2,3,5,7} squared. so, m can be 1 (if no primes are chosen), each prime squared, products of two distinct primes squared, etc., up to all primes squared. wait, but if m is allowed to be a product of primes squared, then m and n would be coprime because they don't share any prime factors. so, m is a product of some subset of the primes {2,3,5,7}, each squared. so, m can be written as (p)^2 where p is a product of primes from {2,3,5,7}. then n would be (2*3*5*7)^2 / m = (2*3*5*7 / p)^2. so, m and n are squares of integers, coprime, and m*n=2102. therefore, the number of such m is equal to the number of subsets of {2,3,5,7}, which is 2^4=16. however, since m < n, we must have m < 2102/m, which implies m2 < 2102, so m < 210. therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of m which are squares of square-free numbers (since m is square of product of distinct primes) and m <210. but wait, m is a square. the square root of m must be a square-free integer (product of distinct primes from {2,3,5,7}). so sqrt(m) is a square-free positive integer made from the primes 2,3,5,7. therefore, sqrt(m) can be any subset of {2,3,5,7} multiplied together (including 1). then m is (subset product)^2. to have m < n, since m * n =2102, m < n implies m2 < 2102, so m <210. therefore, sqrt(m) must be less than 210^(1/2) = sqrt(210) ≈14.49. therefore, the product of primes in the subset (which is sqrt(m)) must be less than14.5. therefore, subsets of {2,3,5,7} with product less than14.5. let's list them: all subsets s of {2,3,5,7} where product of elements is <14.5. 1. {} -> product 1 (<14.5) 2. {2} -> 2 3. {3} ->3 4. {5} ->5 5. {7} ->7 6. {2,3} ->6 7. {2,5} ->10 8. {2,7} ->14 9. {3,5} ->15 (excluded) 10. {3,7} ->21 (excluded) 11. {5,7} ->35 (excluded) 12. {2,3,5} ->30 (excluded) 13. {2,3,7} ->42 (excluded) 14. {2,5,7} ->70 (excluded) 15. {3,5,7} ->105 (excluded) 16. {2,3,5,7} ->210 (excluded) so, the valid subsets s (with product <14.5) are subsets where the product is 1,2,3,5,6,7,10,14. therefore, the number of such subsets is 8. therefore, the number of possible m is 8, each corresponding to a unique a =210*m where m is the square of the product of primes in the subset. for example: - for s = {}, m =12=1, a=210*1=210, n=2102/m=2102, which is b=210*210. check m=1, n=2102. gcd(210, 210*210)=210, lcm is 210*210*210=2103. yes, that works. - for s={2}, m=22=4, a=210*4, n=2102/4= (210/2)^2=1052=11025, so b=210*11025/210=11025. but wait, b should be 210*n', where n' is 11025/(210). wait, 210*4 * 210*11025/(210) =210*4 *11025=210^3 *4. wait, maybe i confused something here. wait, m and n in the previous steps are m'=m'original and n'=2102/m', such that a=210*sqrt(m'), since m' is a square. wait, maybe i need to correct this. wait, actually, m in the equation a=210*m comes from a=210*m, b=210*n, with m*n=2102. but m and n there are not the same as the subsets s. wait, perhaps i need to clarify. let me correct: since a and b are such that gcd(a,b)=210, we can write a=210*m and b=210*n, where gcd(m,n)=1. then, the lcm of a and b is lcm(a,b)=210*lcm(m,n). but since lcm(a,b)=2103, we have 210*lcm(m,n)=2103 => lcm(m,n)=2102. since m and n are coprime, lcm(m,n)=m*n. therefore, m*n=2102. so, m and n are coprime and positive integers with m*n=2102. since m and n are coprime, they must be square-free? no, 2102 is 22*32*52*72. so, m and n being coprime and multiplying to 2102 implies that each prime exponent in 2102 (which is 2 for each prime) is entirely in m or entirely in n. therefore, m is of the form (2^{e1}3^{e2}5^{e3}7^{e4}) where each e_i is 0 or 2. because if a prime is in m, it must be squared, and if not, it's in n. therefore, m can be written as the product of squares of some subset of the primes {2,3,5,7}. so m is 1, 22, 32, 52,72, (2*3)^2, (2*5)^2, (2*7)^2, (3*5)^2, etc., up to (2*3*5*7)^2. however, since m and n must satisfy m < n, and m *n=2102, then m < 2102/m, which implies m2 <2102, so m <210. therefore, m must be a divisor of 2102, coprime with n=2102/m, and m <210. therefore, m is the product of squares of some primes from {2,3,5,7}, so sqrt(m) is the product of some primes from that set. therefore, sqrt(m) must be less than sqrt(210)= ~14.49. therefore, sqrt(m) must be an integer (since m is a square) which is the product of some primes (subset of {2,3,5,7}) and less than14.5. therefore, the possible sqrt(m) are: 1. product of 0 primes: 1 (but 1 is the product of zero primes). 2. product of one prime: 2,3,5,7. 3. product of two primes: 2*3=6, 2*5=10, 2*7=14, 3*5=15 (which is 15>14.49, so excluded). the other two-prime products are also larger: 3*7=21, 5*7=35. so, only two-prime products 6,10,14 are allowed. 4. product of three primes: all such products are 2*3*5=30, which is too big. so, the possible sqrt(m) are 1,2,3,5,7,6,10,14. each of these corresponds to m being 1,4,9,25,49,36,100,196. then m is the square, and a=210*m. so, each of these m's gives a different a. therefore, the number of possible m's is 8, so the number of possible a's is 8. therefore, the answer should be 8. but to confirm, let me list them: 1. m=1: a=210*1=210, b=210*2102/1=2103. check gcd(210,2103)=210, lcm(210,2103)=2103. correct. 2. m=4: a=210*4, b=210* (2102/4)=210*(1052/4). wait, 2102=44100, 44100/4=11025. so b=210*11025/210=11025. check gcd(210*4, 210*11025)=210*gcd(4,11025). since 11025=5^2*3^2*7^2, gcd(4,11025)=1. so gcd(a,b)=210*1=210, correct. lcm(a,b)=lcm(210*4,210*11025)=210*lcm(4,11025). lcm(4,11025)=11025*4/gcd(4,11025)=44100. then 210*44100=2103. correct. 3. m=9: a=210*9, b=210*(2102/9)=210*(44100/9)=210*4900=210*4900. check gcd(210*9,210*4900)=210*gcd(9,4900). since 4900=2^2*5^2*7^2, gcd(9,4900)=1. so gcd(a,b)=210. lcm(a,b)=210*lcm(9,4900)=210*(9*4900)=210*44100=2103. correct. 4. m=25: similarly, a=210*25, b=210*(2102/25)=210*1764. check gcd(210*25,210*1764)=210* gcd(25,1764). since 1764=2^2*3^2*7^2, gcd(25,1764)=1. so gcd(a,b)=210. lcm(a,b)=210*lcm(25,1764)=210*(25*1764/ gcd(25,1764))=210*25*1764/1=210*44100=2103. correct. 5. m=49: a=210*49, b=210*(2102/49)=210*44100/49=210*900=189000. check gcd(210*49,189000)=210* gcd(49,900). gcd(49,900)=1. so gcd(a,b)=210. lcm(a,b)=210*lcm(49,900)=210*(49*900)=210*44100=2103. correct. 6. m=36: a=210*36, b=210*(2102/36)=210*1225. check gcd(210*36,210*1225)=210*gcd(36,1225). since 1225=52*72, gcd(36,1225)=1. so gcd(a,b)=210. lcm(a,b)=210*lcm(36,1225)=210*(36*1225)=210*44100=2103. correct. 7. m=100: a=210*100, b=210*(2102/100)=210*441*210/10=210*441*21. wait, 2102/100= (210/10)^2=212=441. so b=210*441=92610. check gcd(210*100,210*441)=210* gcd(100,441). since 441=212=32*72, gcd(100,441)=1. so gcd(a,b)=210. lcm(a,b)=210*lcm(100,441)=210*(100*441/ gcd(100,441))=210*100*441=210*44100=2103. correct. 8. m=196: a=210*196, b=210*(2102/196)=210*(44100/196)=210*225. check gcd(210*196,210*225)=210*gcd(196,225). since 196=142, 225=152. their gcd is 1. so gcd(a,b)=210. lcm(a,b)=210*lcm(196,225)=210*(196*225/1)=210*44100=2103. correct. so, all these m values satisfy the conditions. thus, the number of possible a's is 8. therefore, the answer is 8. but let me check once again. the possible m's are the squares of the products of primes from the set {2,3,5,7} such that the product is less than sqrt(2102)=210. since sqrt(2102) is 210. but sqrt(m) is the product of primes in s, so that product must be less than sqrt(2102)=210. wait, but in reality, sqrt(m) < 210. but that would not restrict anything, since the product of primes in s (as sqrt(m)) must be less than 210. however, in the prior analysis, the restriction came from m < n, which translates to m <2102/m, so m2 <2102, so m <210. therefore, sqrt(m) <sqrt(210). but sqrt(m) is the product of primes in s. therefore, the product of primes in s (sqrt(m)) must be less than sqrt(210)=~14.49. therefore, that's where the restriction comes from. so, the maximum product of primes in s is 2*3*5*7=210, but since we need product <14.5. therefore, only subsets with product up to14. so, the 8 subsets listed earlier. therefore, the answer is 8. therefore, the number of possible values for a is 8. so, the final answer is 8.

answer: given that \(\gcd(a, b) = 210\) and \(\mathop{\text{lcm}}[a, b] = 210^3\), we start by expressing \(a\) and \(b\) as multiples of their gcd. let \(a = 210m\) and \(b = 210n\) where \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime positive integers. the product condition \(a \cdot b = \gcd(a, b) \cdot \mathop{\text{lcm}}[a, b]\) gives us:

\[
(210m)(210n) = 210 \cdot 210^3 \implies 210^2 \cdot mn = 210^4 \implies mn = 210^2
\]

since \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime, they must be such that \(m \cdot n = 210^2\) with \(\gcd(m, n) = 1\). we need to find the number of pairs \((m, n)\) where \(m < n\) and \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime. 

the prime factorization of \(210\) is \(2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7\), so \(210^2 = 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \times 7^2\). each prime factor must be assigned entirely to \(m\) or \(n\), leading to \(2^4 = 16\) possible assignments. however, since \(m < n\), we only consider pairs where the product of the assigned primes for \(m\) is less than the product for \(n\).

the product of primes assigned to \(m\) must be less than \(\sqrt{210}\) (approximately 14.49). valid products of primes (less than 14.49) are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, and 14. these correspond to 8 subsets of the prime factors \(\{2, 3, 5, 7\}\).

thus, there are 8 possible values for \(m\), leading to 8 possible values for \(a = 210m\).

the final answer is \(\boxed{8}\)
