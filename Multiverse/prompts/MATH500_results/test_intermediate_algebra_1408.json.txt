Okay, so I need to solve this problem where \( z \) is a complex number such that \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \). Then, I have to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \).
Hmm, let's start by understanding the given equation.
The number \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \) is the golden ratio, often denoted by \( \phi \).
It's approximately 1.618, but of course, here we need to deal with it exactly.
Since \( z \) is a complex number, we can perhaps express it in polar form.
Let me recall that for any complex number \( z \), we can write it as \( z = re^{i\theta} \), where \( r \) is the modulus and \( \theta \) is the argument.
Then, \( \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{r}e^{-i\theta} \).
So, the given equation becomes \( re^{i\theta} + \frac{1}{r}e^{-i\theta} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \).
Hmm, maybe if we assume that \( z \) lies on the unit circle, so that \( r = 1 \).
Then \( \frac{1}{z} \) would just be \( \overline{z} \), the complex conjugate.
Let me check if that's a possible assumption.
If \( r = 1 \), then the equation simplifies to \( 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \).
But wait, \( 2\cos\theta \) would have to equal \( \phi \), which is \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \).
Let's see, \( 2\cos\theta = \phi \approx 1.618 \), so \( \cos\theta \approx 0.809 \).
Then \( \theta \) would be \( \cos^{-1}( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4 } ) \).
Wait, no, wait: if \( 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), then \( \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \).
Let's compute that: \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \approx \frac{3.236}{4} \approx 0.809 \), which is a valid cosine value since it's between -1 and 1.
So \( \theta = \cos^{-1}( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} ) \).
But is there such an angle that can be expressed in terms of standard angles?
Alternatively, maybe \( \theta \) is related to the pentagon or something, since the golden ratio is related to pentagons and pentagrams.
Alternatively, maybe the minimal polynomial of \( \phi \) can be linked to some trigonometric identities.
Let me recall that \( \phi \) satisfies the equation \( x^2 = x + 1 \).
So perhaps if I let \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \phi \), then maybe \( z \) satisfies some equation that can be manipulated.
Let me try to find \( z \).
Let me set \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \phi \).
Multiply both sides by \( z \): \( z^2 - \phi z + 1 = 0 \).
So solving this quadratic equation: \( z = \frac{\phi \pm \sqrt{\phi^2 - 4}}{2} \).
Wait, \( \phi^2 - 4 \) is \( (\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2})^2 - 4 = \frac{1 + 2\sqrt{5} + 5}{4} - 4 = \frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5}}{4} - 4 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} - 4 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5} - 8}{2} = \frac{-5 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \).
Wait, that's negative.
Let me check my calculation:
\( \phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), so \( \phi^2 = \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{1 + 2\sqrt{5} + 5}{4} = \frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \).
Therefore, \( \phi^2 - 4 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} - 4 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5} - 8}{2} = \frac{-5 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \).
Indeed, that is negative because \( \sqrt{5} \approx 2.236 \), so \( -5 + 2.236 = -2.764 \), so the discriminant is negative.
Therefore, the solutions for \( z \) are complex numbers, which makes sense.
So \( z = \frac{\phi \pm i\sqrt{5 - \phi^2}}{2} \).
But since \( 5 - \phi^2 = 5 - \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{10 - 3 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{7 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \).
Wait, that seems more complicated.
Alternatively, perhaps note that \( \phi \) has the property that \( \phi - 1 = \frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{2} \), and in fact, \( \phi - 1 = 1/\phi \).
Let me recall that \( \phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), so \( 1/\phi = \frac{2}{1 + \sqrt{5}} \).
Multiply numerator and denominator by \( \sqrt{5} - 1 \): \( \frac{2(\sqrt{5} - 1)}{(\sqrt{5} + 1)(\sqrt{5} - 1)} \) = \( \frac{2(\sqrt{5} - 1)}{5 - 1} \) = \( \frac{2(\sqrt{5} - 1)}{4} \) = \( \frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{2} \), which is indeed \( \phi - 1 \).
So \( \phi - 1 = 1/\phi \).
Interesting, but how does that help me here?
Alternatively, maybe we can express \( z \) in exponential form.
If \( z = e^{i\theta} \), then \( z + \frac{1}{z} = 2\cos\theta \).
But here, \( 2\cos\theta = \phi \approx 1.618 \), so \( \cos\theta = \phi / 2 \approx 0.809 \), so \( \theta = \cos^{-1}(\phi / 2) \).
But is there a special angle here?
Let me compute \( \cos^{-1}(\phi/2) \).
Since \( \phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), \( \phi / 2 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \).
Let me see if this relates to a known angle.
For example, \( \cos(36^\circ) = \cos(\pi/5) = (1 + \sqrt{5})/4 \times 2 \)?
Wait, actually, \( \cos(36^\circ) = (1 + \sqrt{5})/4 \times 2 \).
Wait, let me check.
Wait, I know that \( \cos(36^\circ) = (1 + \sqrt{5})/4 \times 2 \).
Wait, let's compute \( \cos(36^\circ) \).
From the golden triangle, we know that \( \cos(36^\circ) = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \times 2 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \)?
Wait, no.
Wait, actually, \( \cos(36^\circ) \) is equal to \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \times 2 \), right?
Let me compute numerically.
\( \cos(36^\circ) \approx 0.8090 \), which is the same as \( (1 + \sqrt{5})/4 \times 2 \).
Wait, actually, \( (1 + \sqrt{5})/2 \times 1/2 \) is not—Let me compute \( (1 + \sqrt{5})/4 \).
Wait, \( (1 + \sqrt{5}) \) is approximately 3.236, divided by 4 is approximately 0.809, which is exactly \( \cos(36^\circ) \).
Therefore, \( \cos(36^\circ) = (1 + \sqrt{5})/4 \times 2 \)?
Wait, no.
Wait, \( \cos(36^\circ) \approx 0.809 \), which is exactly \( (1 + \sqrt{5})/4 \times 2 \)?
Wait, no.
Wait, \( (1 + \sqrt{5})/4 \) is approximately 0.809/2.
Wait, no.
Wait, let's compute \( (1 + \sqrt{5})/4 \): \( \sqrt{5} \approx 2.236, so 1 + sqrt(5) ≈ 3.236; 3.236 / 4 ≈ 0.809.
So, \( (1 + \sqrt{5})/4 ≈ 0.809 \), which is cos(36°).
Wait, so \( \cos(36^\circ) = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \times 2 \)?
Wait, no.
Wait, 0.809 is cos(36°), and \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \approx 0.809 \), but that would mean \( \cos(36^\circ) = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \times 2 \)?
Wait, no.
Wait, \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \approx 0.809 \), so 2 times that is approximately 1.618, which is phi.
Wait, but we had that \( 2\cos(36^\circ) = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), which is phi.
Wait, 2 * 0.809 ≈ 1.618, which is phi.
So, that would mean \( 2\cos(36^\circ) = \phi \).
Therefore, \( 2\cos\theta = \phi \implies \theta = 36^\circ \), or in radians, \( \pi/5 \).
Therefore, if \( z = e^{i\pi/5} \) or \( z = e^{-i\pi/5} \), then \( z + 1/z = 2\cos(36^\circ) = \phi \).
Therefore, \( z \) is either \( e^{i\pi/5} \) or \( e^{-i\pi/5} \).
Wait, that makes sense because the equation \( z + 1/z = \phi \) leads us to \( z = e^{i\pi/5} \) or \( z = e^{-i\pi/5} \).
Therefore, if \( z = e^{i\pi/5} \), then \( z^{85} = e^{i85\pi/5} = e^{i17\pi} \).
Similarly, \( z^{85} = e^{i17\pi} = e^{i\pi} = -1 \), since \( e^{i\pi(2k+1)} = -1 \).
Wait, 17 pi is equivalent to pi modulo 2 pi, since 17 pi = 8*2pi + pi, but 8*2pi is just 16pi, and 17pi - 16pi = pi.
So, e^{i17pi} = e^{i(pi)} = -1.
Similarly, if z = e^{-i pi /5}, then z^{85} = e^{-i85 pi /5} = e^{-i17 pi} = e^{-i pi} = -1.
Therefore, in both cases, z^{85} = -1.
Therefore, z^{85} + 1/z^{85} = -1 + 1/(-1) = -1 -1 = -2.
So, the answer is -2.
Wait, let me verify this step by step.
First, establish that z is on the unit circle.
Given z + 1/z = phi, which is a real number.
So if z is a solution, then so is its complex conjugate.
Also, since z is a complex number, we can write z = e^{i theta}, so z + 1/z = 2 cos theta.
So 2 cos theta = phi, so theta = pi/5 or -pi/5.
So z is either e^{i pi/5} or e^{-i pi/5}.
Then, z^{85} would be e^{i 85 pi/5} = e^{i 17 pi} = e^{i pi} = -1, since 17 pi is equivalent to pi modulo 2 pi.
Similarly, if z = e^{-i pi/5}, then z^{85} = e^{-i 85 pi /5} = e^{-i17 pi} = e^{-i pi} = -1.
Therefore, in both cases, z^{85} = -1.
Therefore, z^{85} + 1/z^{85} = (-1) + 1/(-1) = -1 -1 = -2.
Therefore, the answer is -2.
Wait, but let me make sure that my calculation for the angle is correct.
If theta = pi/5, then z^{n} = e^{i n pi /5}, so z^{85} = e^{i 85 pi /5} = e^{i 17 pi}.
Since 17 pi = 16 pi + pi = 8*2pi + pi, so e^{i17 pi} = e^{i pi} = cos(pi) + i sin(pi) = -1 + 0i = -1.
Similarly, 17 pi divided by 2pi is 17/2, which is 8.5, so it's 8 full rotations (which cancel out) and half a rotation, which is pi.
So, yes, e^{i17 pi} is the same as e^{i pi}, which is -1.
Same for the negative exponent.
So, this approach seems correct.
Therefore, the answer is -2.
Alternatively, perhaps another method.
Suppose we consider that z + 1/z = phi.
Then, maybe we can find a recurrence relation for z^n + 1/z^n.
Let me recall that if z + 1/z = 2 cos theta, then z^n + 1/z^n = 2 cos(n theta).
Wait, that's the identity for complex numbers on the unit circle.
So if z = e^{i theta}, then z^n + 1/z^n = 2 cos(n theta).
So here, since z + 1/z = phi = 2 cos(pi/5), then theta = pi/5.
Therefore, z^n + 1/z^n = 2 cos(n pi/5).
Therefore, for n = 85, we have z^{85} + 1/z^{85} = 2 cos(85 pi /5).
Let's compute 85 pi /5: 85 divided by 5 is 17.
So that's 17 pi.
cos(17 pi) = cos(pi + 16 pi) = cos(pi) = -1.
Therefore, 2 cos(17 pi) = 2*(-1) = -2.
Therefore, the answer is -2.
This seems another way to get the same result.
So regardless of the approach—whether through exponential form and calculating the power directly, or using the identity for z^n + 1/z^n—both lead to the same conclusion.
Therefore, the answer should be -2.
Let me check if there's another possible angle here.
For example, if instead of principal arguments, maybe another representation.
But since the equation z + 1/z = phi ties z to theta = pi/5 or theta = -pi/5, those are the principal arguments, and any coterminal angles would lead to the same result when raised to the 85th power.
So, I think that's safe.
Alternatively, perhaps z isn't on the unit circle.
Wait, earlier I assumed that z is on the unit circle because if z + 1/z is real, then z is on the unit circle.
Wait, is that true?
Wait, no.
Let me recall that if z is a complex number such that z + 1/z is real, does that mean that z lies on the unit circle?
Wait, suppose z = re^{i theta}, then z + 1/z = r e^{i theta} + 1/(r e^{i theta}) = r e^{i theta} + (1/r) e^{-i theta}.
The real parts are r cos theta + (1/r) cos theta, and the imaginary parts are r sin theta - (1/r) sin theta.
For z + 1/z to be real, the imaginary part must be zero.
Therefore, r sin theta - (1/r) sin theta = 0.
So sin theta (r - 1/r) = 0.
Therefore, either sin theta = 0, which would make z a real number (since theta = 0 or pi), or r - 1/r = 0, which implies r =1.
Therefore, in our case, since z is a complex number (not specified to be non-real, but given that z + 1/z = phi which is positive, but if z were real, then z + 1/z = phi would require z to be positive real number.
But solving the quadratic equation z^2 - phi z + 1 = 0, the solutions are (phi)/2 ± i sqrt(1 - (phi)^2/4).
Wait, but phi is approximately 1.618, so (phi)^2 is approximately 2.618, so (phi)^2/4 is approximately 0.6545, so 1 - 0.6545 = 0.3455, which is positive?
Wait, but earlier we saw that when we considered z as a complex number on the unit circle, then we had the solutions with modulus 1.
Wait, but if z is real, then z + 1/z = phi implies z^2 - phi z +1 =0, which has discriminant phi^2 -4, which as before is negative.
Therefore, the solutions must be complex conjugates, which places them on the unit circle as we saw.
Therefore, z must indeed lie on the unit circle, because otherwise, if z is real, then the equation would have real coefficients but the discriminant is negative, which would not give real solutions.
Therefore, z must be non-real and on the unit circle.
Therefore, our previous reasoning holds.
Therefore, z is e^{i pi/5} or e^{-i pi/5}, leading to z^{85} being e^{i 17 pi} or e^{-i 17 pi}, both of which equal -1, so z^{85} +1/z^{85} is -1 + (-1) = -2.
Therefore, the conclusion is correct.
**Final Answer**
\boxed{-2}
</Think>

Answer: Given the complex number \( z \) such that \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we recognize that \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \) is the golden ratio \( \phi \). 

We assume \( z \) lies on the unit circle, so \( z = e^{i\theta} \) for some angle \( \theta \). This gives us the equation:
\[
2\cos\theta = \phi \implies \cos\theta = \frac{\phi}{2}
\]
Since \( \phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we find \( \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \approx 0.809 \), which corresponds to \( \theta = \pm \frac{\pi}{5} \). Thus, \( z \) can be written as \( e^{i\pi/5} \) or \( e^{-i\pi/5} \).

To find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \), we compute:
\[
z^{85} = \left(e^{i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{i85\pi/5} = e^{i17\pi} = e^{i\pi} = -1
\]
Similarly, for \( z = e^{-i\pi/5} \):
\[
z^{85} = \left(e^{-i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{-i17\pi} = e^{-i\pi} = -1
\]
Thus, in both cases:
\[
z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = -1 + \frac{1}{-1} = -1 - 1 = -2
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{-2}
\]

wait, \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \approx 0.809 \), so 2 times that is approximately 1.618, which is phi.
wait, but we had that \( 2\cos(36^\circ) = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), which is phi.
wait, 2 * 0.809 ≈ 1.618, which is phi.
so, that would mean \( 2\cos(36^\circ) = \phi \).
therefore, \( 2\cos\theta = \phi \implies \theta = 36^\circ \), or in radians, \( \pi/5 \).
therefore, if \( z = e^{i\pi/5} \) or \( z = e^{-i\pi/5} \), then \( z + 1/z = 2\cos(36^\circ) = \phi \).
therefore, \( z \) is either \( e^{i\pi/5} \) or \( e^{-i\pi/5} \).
wait, that makes sense because the equation \( z + 1/z = \phi \) leads us to \( z = e^{i\pi/5} \) or \( z = e^{-i\pi/5} \).
therefore, if \( z = e^{i\pi/5} \), then \( z^{85} = e^{i85\pi/5} = e^{i17\pi} \).
similarly, \( z^{85} = e^{i17\pi} = e^{i\pi} = -1 \), since \( e^{i\pi(2k+1)} = -1 \).
wait, 17 pi is equivalent to pi modulo 2 pi, since 17 pi = 8*2pi + pi, but 8*2pi is just 16pi, and 17pi - 16pi = pi.
so, e^{i17pi} = e^{i(pi)} = -1.
similarly, if z = e^{-i pi /5}, then z^{85} = e^{-i85 pi /5} = e^{-i17 pi} = e^{-i pi} = -1.
therefore, in both cases, z^{85} = -1.
therefore, z^{85} + 1/z^{85} = -1 + 1/(-1) = -1 -1 = -2.
so, the answer is -2.
wait, let me verify this step by step.
first, establish that z is on the unit circle.
given z + 1/z = phi, which is a real number.
so if z is a solution, then so is its complex conjugate.
also, since z is a complex number, we can write z = e^{i theta}, so z + 1/z = 2 cos theta.
so 2 cos theta = phi, so theta = pi/5 or -pi/5.
so z is either e^{i pi/5} or e^{-i pi/5}.
then, z^{85} would be e^{i 85 pi/5} = e^{i 17 pi} = e^{i pi} = -1, since 17 pi is equivalent to pi modulo 2 pi.
similarly, if z = e^{-i pi/5}, then z^{85} = e^{-i 85 pi /5} = e^{-i17 pi} = e^{-i pi} = -1.
therefore, in both cases, z^{85} = -1.
therefore, z^{85} + 1/z^{85} = (-1) + 1/(-1) = -1 -1 = -2.
therefore, the answer is -2.
wait, but let me make sure that my calculation for the angle is correct.
if theta = pi/5, then z^{n} = e^{i n pi /5}, so z^{85} = e^{i 85 pi /5} = e^{i 17 pi}.
since 17 pi = 16 pi + pi = 8*2pi + pi, so e^{i17 pi} = e^{i pi} = cos(pi) + i sin(pi) = -1 + 0i = -1.
similarly, 17 pi divided by 2pi is 17/2, which is 8.5, so it's 8 full rotations (which cancel out) and half a rotation, which is pi.
so, yes, e^{i17 pi} is the same as e^{i pi}, which is -1.
same for the negative exponent.
so, this approach seems correct.
therefore, the answer is -2.
alternatively, perhaps another method.
suppose we consider that z + 1/z = phi.
then, maybe we can find a recurrence relation for z^n + 1/z^n.
let me recall that if z + 1/z = 2 cos theta, then z^n + 1/z^n = 2 cos(n theta).
wait, that's the identity for complex numbers on the unit circle.
so if z = e^{i theta}, then z^n + 1/z^n = 2 cos(n theta).
so here, since z + 1/z = phi = 2 cos(pi/5), then theta = pi/5.
therefore, z^n + 1/z^n = 2 cos(n pi/5).
therefore, for n = 85, we have z^{85} + 1/z^{85} = 2 cos(85 pi /5).
let's compute 85 pi /5: 85 divided by 5 is 17.
so that's 17 pi.
cos(17 pi) = cos(pi + 16 pi) = cos(pi) = -1.
therefore, 2 cos(17 pi) = 2*(-1) = -2.
therefore, the answer is -2.
this seems another way to get the same result.
so regardless of the approach—whether through exponential form and calculating the power directly, or using the identity for z^n + 1/z^n—both lead to the same conclusion.
therefore, the answer should be -2.
let me check if there's another possible angle here.
for example, if instead of principal arguments, maybe another representation.
but since the equation z + 1/z = phi ties z to theta = pi/5 or theta = -pi/5, those are the principal arguments, and any coterminal angles would lead to the same result when raised to the 85th power.
so, i think that's safe.
alternatively, perhaps z isn't on the unit circle.
wait, earlier i assumed that z is on the unit circle because if z + 1/z is real, then z is on the unit circle.
wait, is that true?
wait, no.
let me recall that if z is a complex number such that z + 1/z is real, does that mean that z lies on the unit circle?
wait, suppose z = re^{i theta}, then z + 1/z = r e^{i theta} + 1/(r e^{i theta}) = r e^{i theta} + (1/r) e^{-i theta}.
the real parts are r cos theta + (1/r) cos theta, and the imaginary parts are r sin theta - (1/r) sin theta.
for z + 1/z to be real, the imaginary part must be zero.
therefore, r sin theta - (1/r) sin theta = 0.
so sin theta (r - 1/r) = 0.
therefore, either sin theta = 0, which would make z a real number (since theta = 0 or pi), or r - 1/r = 0, which implies r =1.
therefore, in our case, since z is a complex number (not specified to be non-real, but given that z + 1/z = phi which is positive, but if z were real, then z + 1/z = phi would require z to be positive real number.
but solving the quadratic equation z^2 - phi z + 1 = 0, the solutions are (phi)/2 ± i sqrt(1 - (phi)^2/4).
wait, but phi is approximately 1.618, so (phi)^2 is approximately 2.618, so (phi)^2/4 is approximately 0.6545, so 1 - 0.6545 = 0.3455, which is positive?
wait, but earlier we saw that when we considered z as a complex number on the unit circle, then we had the solutions with modulus 1.
wait, but if z is real, then z + 1/z = phi implies z^2 - phi z +1 =0, which has discriminant phi^2 -4, which as before is negative.
therefore, the solutions must be complex conjugates, which places them on the unit circle as we saw.
therefore, z must indeed lie on the unit circle, because otherwise, if z is real, then the equation would have real coefficients but the discriminant is negative, which would not give real solutions.
therefore, z must be non-real and on the unit circle.
therefore, our previous reasoning holds.
therefore, z is e^{i pi/5} or e^{-i pi/5}, leading to z^{85} being e^{i 17 pi} or e^{-i 17 pi}, both of which equal -1, so z^{85} +1/z^{85} is -1 + (-1) = -2.
therefore, the conclusion is correct.
**final answer**
\boxed{-2}
</think>

answer: given the complex number \( z \) such that \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we recognize that \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \) is the golden ratio \( \phi \). 

we assume \( z \) lies on the unit circle, so \( z = e^{i\theta} \) for some angle \( \theta \). this gives us the equation:
\[
2\cos\theta = \phi \implies \cos\theta = \frac{\phi}{2}
\]
since \( \phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we find \( \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \approx 0.809 \), which corresponds to \( \theta = \pm \frac{\pi}{5} \). thus, \( z \) can be written as \( e^{i\pi/5} \) or \( e^{-i\pi/5} \).

to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \), we compute:
\[
z^{85} = \left(e^{i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{i85\pi/5} = e^{i17\pi} = e^{i\pi} = -1
\]
similarly, for \( z = e^{-i\pi/5} \):
\[
z^{85} = \left(e^{-i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{-i17\pi} = e^{-i\pi} = -1
\]
thus, in both cases:
\[
z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = -1 + \frac{1}{-1} = -1 - 1 = -2
\]

therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{-2}
\]
