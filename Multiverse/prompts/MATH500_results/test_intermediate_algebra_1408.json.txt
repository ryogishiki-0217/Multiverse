Okay, so I have this problem here: given that z is a complex number such that z + 1/z = (1 + sqrt(5))/2. I need to find z^85 + 1/z^85. Hmm, that's a pretty high exponent. Raising a complex number to the 85th power directly seems impossible without some kind of trick. Let me think.
First, I remember that expressions like z + 1/z sometimes relate to trigonometric functions or exponential functions with imaginary exponents, maybe Euler's formula. Since complex numbers can be represented in polar form, maybe I can express z in terms of its angle.
Let me recall that if z = e^{iθ}, then 1/z = e^{-iθ}, so z + 1/z = 2 cosθ. Wait, is that relevant here? Because here we have z + 1/z equals the golden ratio, (1 + sqrt(5))/2. That's approximately 1.618. But the problem is, cosine of an angle is between -1 and 1, so 2 cosθ would be between -2 and 2. The golden ratio is about 1.618, which is less than 2, so that could work. So maybe we can represent z as e^{iθ} such that 2 cosθ = (1 + sqrt(5))/2. That would mean cosθ = (1 + sqrt(5))/4. Let me calculate that value. (1 + sqrt(5)) is about 3.236, so divided by 4 is about 0.809. So cosθ is approximately 0.809. Then θ would be arccos(0.809...). But maybe there's an exact value for θ. Let me check.
Wait, (1 + sqrt(5))/4. Let me see. Is this related to the golden ratio? The golden ratio φ is (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ≈ 1.618, so half of that is approximately 0.809, which is (1 + sqrt(5))/4. So yes, cosθ = φ/2. Hmm, interesting. Maybe θ is some special angle related to the pentagon or something, since the golden ratio is related to pentagons and pentagrams. But I'm not sure. Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
So if z = e^{iθ}, then z^{85} + 1/z^{85} = 2 cos(85θ). So the key is to find θ such that 2 cosθ = (1 + sqrt(5))/2, then compute 2 cos(85θ). So we need to find θ where cosθ = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 ≈ 0.809, then multiply θ by 85 and find the cosine.
But computing cos(85θ) directly would be difficult. There must be some periodicity or symmetry here. Maybe we can find the minimal angle θ such that this holds and then find a pattern or use trigonometric identities to simplify.
Alternatively, maybe we can find a recurrence relation. Since z + 1/z is given, and we need to find z^n + 1/z^n for n=85. Let me recall that if we let a_n = z^n + 1/z^n, then there is a recurrence relation for a_n. Let me check.
Given a_1 = z + 1/z. But wait, here n=1, but in the problem, we have n=85. However, since they gave z + 1/z, perhaps we can use a recurrence. Let me recall that for a_n = z^n + 1/z^n, we can use the identity:
a_{n+1} = (z^{n+1} + 1/z^{n+1}) = (z + 1/z)(z^n + 1/z^n) - (z^{n-1} + 1/z^{n-1}) = (a_1)(a_n) - a_{n-1}
So the recurrence is a_{n+1} = a_1 a_n - a_{n-1}
Therefore, if we can compute a_n using this recurrence, we can find a_{85}. But computing up to 85 terms seems tedious. However, maybe there is periodicity or some pattern that repeats. Alternatively, maybe we can find a lower exponent that has a small cycle.
Alternatively, perhaps the minimal polynomial of z is known, and we can find z^k in terms of lower exponents.
Wait, let's think about minimal polynomials. Given z + 1/z = (1 + sqrt(5))/2, we can multiply both sides by z to get a quadratic equation:
z^2 - ( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ) z + 1 = 0
So the minimal polynomial of z is z^2 - ( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ) z + 1 = 0. Therefore, z satisfies the equation z^2 - ( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ) z + 1 = 0. Therefore, for any integer n ≥ 2, we can express z^n in terms of lower exponents using this recurrence.
Specifically, from the equation, we can write z^2 = ( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ) z - 1. Then, multiplying both sides by z^{n-1}, we get z^{n+1} = ( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ) z^n - z^{n-1}. Therefore, z^{n+1} = ( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ) z^n - z^{n-1}. Thus, this gives a recurrence relation for z^n. However, we need z^{85} + 1/z^{85}, which relates to a_n as defined earlier.
Since a_{n} = z^n + 1/z^n, we can use the recurrence a_{n+1} = ( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ) a_n - a_{n-1}. This is the same as the previous recurrence because:
a_{n+1} = z^{n+1} + 1/z^{n+1} = [ ( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ) z^n - z^{n-1} ] + [ ( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ) (1/z^{n-1}) - (1/z^{n+1}) ] ? Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Let me note that since z satisfies z^2 - ( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ) z +1 =0, then so does 1/z, since if we divide the equation by z^2, we get 1 - ( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ) (1/z ) + (1/z^2 ) = 0, so (1/z)^2 - ( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 )(1/z) +1 =0. Therefore, z and 1/z are roots of the same quadratic. Therefore, the same recurrence relation applies to both z and 1/z.
Therefore, the sequence a_n = z^n + 1/z^n satisfies the linear recurrence:
a_{n} = ( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ) a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}
For n ≥ 2, with initial conditions a_0 = 2 (since z^0 + 1/z^0 = 2), a_1 = (1 + sqrt(5))/2.
Wait, but we need to be careful with the indices. Let's check:
The recurrence is a_{n} = ( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ) a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}
So, for n=2:
a_2 = ( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ) a_1 - a_0
Compute a_2:
If z + 1/z = (1 + sqrt(5))/2, then squaring both sides:
(z + 1/z)^2 = [ (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ]^2
z^2 + 2 + 1/z^2 = (1 + 2 sqrt(5) + 5)/4 = (6 + 2 sqrt(5))/4 = (3 + sqrt(5))/2
Therefore, z^2 + 1/z^2 = (3 + sqrt(5))/2 - 2 = (3 + sqrt(5) - 4)/2 = (-1 + sqrt(5))/2
But according to the recurrence:
a_2 = ( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ) * ( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ) - a_0 = [ (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ]^2 - 2
Which is (1 + 2 sqrt(5) + 5)/4 - 2 = (6 + 2 sqrt(5))/4 - 2 = (3 + sqrt(5))/2 - 2 = (-1 + sqrt(5))/2. Which matches. So the recurrence holds.
Therefore, the recurrence works. So, in order to compute a_{85}, we can use this linear recurrence. However, computing up to 85 terms is impractical by hand. Therefore, we need to find a pattern or periodicity in the sequence a_n.
Alternatively, since the recurrence is linear and homogeneous, we can solve it explicitly. The characteristic equation is:
t^2 - ( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ) t + 1 = 0
Which is the same quadratic equation as satisfied by z. Therefore, the roots are z and 1/z. Therefore, the general solution is:
a_n = A z^n + B (1/z)^n
But we know that a_n = z^n + 1/z^n, so in fact, this is exactly the case where A = B = 1. Hence, the formula is already given. So we don't need to solve for A and B. Therefore, the sequence a_n is exactly z^n + 1/z^n.
But this doesn't necessarily help us compute a_{85} easily. Alternatively, perhaps we can note that the sequence a_n is periodic. But with what period?
Alternatively, since the problem gives the field of mathematics as abstract algebra, perhaps we need to consider this recurrence in a certain ring or field where computations can be done more easily.
Alternatively, maybe the powers of z can be related to some algebraic integers or roots of unity, but given that the minimal polynomial is related to the golden ratio, which is a quadratic irrationality, perhaps we can exploit properties of the golden ratio or the associated algebraic number field.
Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that (1 + sqrt(5))/2 is a root of the polynomial x^2 - x - 1 = 0, which is the minimal polynomial over the rationals. Therefore, the coefficients in the recurrence are related to this polynomial.
Wait, the recurrence for a_n is:
a_n = ( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ) a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}
But since (1 + sqrt(5))/2 is a root of x^2 - x - 1, let's denote φ = (1 + sqrt(5))/2, so φ^2 = φ + 1. Therefore, perhaps we can manipulate the recurrence using properties of φ.
Let me note that φ satisfies φ^2 = φ + 1, and also 1/φ = φ - 1, since φ - 1 = (1 + sqrt(5))/2 -1 = (-1 + sqrt(5))/2.
Also, φ * (φ -1 ) = 1.
Alternatively, maybe we can express a_n in terms of Fibonacci numbers. Because φ is closely related to the Fibonacci sequence.
Recall that the Fibonacci numbers satisfy F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} with F_0=0, F_1=1, and the closed-form formula (Binet's formula):
F_n = (φ^n - (1 - φ)^n) / sqrt(5)
But here, our a_n is similar to the expression φ^n + (1/φ)^n. Wait, indeed:
φ^n + (1/φ)^n = φ^n + (φ -1)^n
So, φ^n + (1 - φ)^n. But Binet's formula relates this to the Lucas numbers, which are defined as L_n = φ^n + (1 - φ)^n. Wait, yes! Lucas numbers are defined by L_n = φ^n + (1 - φ)^n, which is similar to our a_n. Wait, but in our case, a_n = z^n + (1/z)^n. If z is φ, then 1/z is 1/φ = φ -1. So if z = φ, then a_n = L_n. However, in our problem, z is a complex number on the unit circle, whereas φ is a real number. Hmm, but maybe there is a connection.
Wait, but in our problem, z is a complex number with modulus 1, such that z + 1/z = φ. So z is not φ, because φ is a real number greater than 1. So perhaps this is a different context. But maybe the relation still holds.
Alternatively, perhaps the sequence a_n can be expressed in terms of Fibonacci or Lucas numbers. Let's check.
Given that φ is a root of x^2 - x -1, and satisfies φ^2 = φ +1, so φ^n = F_n φ + F_{n-1} (by the property of Fibonacci numbers). Similarly, (1 - φ)^n = F_n (1 - φ) + F_{n-1} (-1)^n. But perhaps not directly applicable here.
Wait, given that a_n = z^n + 1/z^n and z satisfies z + 1/z = φ. So, if we let z = φ, but then 1/z would be φ -1, but φ is greater than 1, so 1/z is a positive real number. However, in our problem, z is a complex number on the unit circle, so 1/z is the conjugate. So this is a different setting. So perhaps connecting to Lucas numbers is not straightforward.
Alternatively, maybe using the fact that φ^2 = φ +1, so powers of φ can be expressed in terms of lower Fibonacci numbers, but again, since our z is not φ, but related to φ.
Alternatively, since we can relate the recurrence to Fibonacci numbers. Let me check the recurrence for a_n:
a_n = φ a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}
But Fibonacci numbers satisfy F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}
However, our recurrence is a linear recurrence with coefficients φ and -1.
Alternatively, perhaps we can express a_n in terms of Fibonacci numbers scaled by some factor. Let me check for small n:
a_0 = 2
a_1 = φ
a_2 = φ * φ - 2 = φ^2 -1. But φ^2 = φ +1, so φ^2 -1 = φ. So a_2 = φ
a_3 = φ * a_2 - a_1 = φ^2 - φ = (φ +1) - φ =1
a_4 = φ * a_3 - a_2 = φ *1 - φ = φ - φ =0
a_5 = φ * a_4 - a_3 = φ*0 -1 = -1
a_6 = φ*(-1) -0 = -φ
a_7 = φ*(-φ) - (-1) = -φ^2 +1 = -(φ +1) +1 = -φ
a_8 = φ*(-φ) - (-φ) = -φ^2 + φ = - (φ +1 ) + φ = -1
a_9 = φ*(-1) - (-φ) = -φ + φ=0
a_10= φ*0 - (-1)=1
a_11= φ*1 -0=φ
a_12= φ*φ -1= φ^2 -1=φ
a_13= φ*φ - φ= same as a3?
Wait, let me compute step by step:
Given recurrence a_n = φ a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}
Starting with:
a_0 = 2
a_1 = φ
a_2 = φ * a_1 - a_0 = φ^2 - 2 = (φ +1) -2 = φ -1 ≈ 1.618 -1 ≈ 0.618
But wait, earlier, when I thought a_2 = φ, that was incorrect. Wait:
Wait φ a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}
For n=2: φ a_1 - a_0 = φ * φ - a_0 = φ^2 - 2. Since φ^2 = φ +1, so φ^2 -2 = (φ +1) -2 = φ -1. So a_2 = φ -1 ≈ 0.618
a_3 = φ a_2 - a_1 = φ(φ -1) - φ = (φ^2 - φ) - φ = (φ +1 - φ ) - φ = 1 - φ ≈ 1 -1.618 ≈ -0.618
a_4 = φ a_3 - a_2 = φ(1 - φ) - (φ -1) = φ - φ^2 - φ +1 = (φ - φ) - φ^2 +1 = -φ^2 +1 = -(φ +1) +1 = -φ
a_5 = φ a_4 - a_3 = φ(-φ) - (1 - φ) = -φ^2 -1 + φ = - (φ +1) -1 + φ = -φ -1 -1 + φ = -2
a_6 = φ a_5 - a_4 = φ(-2) - (-φ) = -2φ + φ = -φ
a_7 = φ a_6 - a_5 = φ(-φ) - (-2) = -φ^2 +2 = - (φ +1) +2 = -φ +1
a_8 = φ a_7 - a_6 = φ(-φ +1) - (-φ) = -φ^2 + φ + φ = - (φ +1) + 2φ = φ -1
a_9 = φ a_8 - a_7 = φ(φ -1) - (-φ +1) = φ^2 - φ + φ -1 = φ^2 -1 = (φ +1) -1 = φ
a_10= φ a_9 - a_8 = φ*φ - (φ -1) = φ^2 - φ +1 = (φ +1) - φ +1 = 2
a_11= φ a_10 - a_9 = φ*2 - φ = φ
a_12= φ a_11 - a_10 = φ*φ - 2 = same as a_2=φ^2 -2=φ-1
So here, at n=10, a_10=2, which was a_0. And a_11=φ, which was a_1. So the sequence repeats every 10 terms. Therefore, the period is 10. Therefore, the sequence a_n is periodic with period 10.
Therefore, since 85 mod 10 is 5, because 85 divided by 10 is 8 with remainder 5. Therefore, a_{85} = a_5 = -2.
Hence, the final answer is -2.
**Final Answer**
\boxed{-2}
</Think>

Answer: Given the problem to solve for \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \) where \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we start by recognizing that \( z \) can be expressed in polar form as \( e^{i\theta} \) such that \( 2 \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \). This implies \( \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \).

We define \( a_n = z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} \) and note that this sequence satisfies the recurrence relation:
\[
a_{n} = \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right) a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}
\]
with initial conditions \( a_0 = 2 \) and \( a_1 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

By computing the first few terms of the sequence, we observe the periodicity:
\[
\begin{align*}
a_0 & = 2, \\
a_1 & = \phi, \\
a_2 & = \phi - 1, \\
a_3 & = 1 - \phi, \\
a_4 & = -\phi, \\
a_5 & = -2, \\
a_6 & = -\phi, \\
a_7 & = -\phi + 1, \\
a_8 & = -1, \\
a_9 & = 0, \\
a_{10} & = 2, \\
a_{11} & = \phi, \\
& \vdots
\end{align*}
\]
We find that the sequence repeats every 10 terms. Therefore, the sequence \( a_n \) is periodic with period 10.

To find \( a_{85} \), we compute \( 85 \mod 10 \), which gives 5. Thus, \( a_{85} = a_5 = -2 \).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{-2}

okay, so i have this problem here: given that z is a complex number such that z + 1/z = (1 + sqrt(5))/2. i need to find z^85 + 1/z^85. hmm, that's a pretty high exponent. raising a complex number to the 85th power directly seems impossible without some kind of trick. let me think.

but computing cos(85θ) directly would be difficult. there must be some periodicity or symmetry here. maybe we can find the minimal angle θ such that this holds and then find a pattern or use trigonometric identities to simplify.
alternatively, maybe we can find a recurrence relation. since z + 1/z is given, and we need to find z^n + 1/z^n for n=85. let me recall that if we let a_n = z^n + 1/z^n, then there is a recurrence relation for a_n. let me check.
given a_1 = z + 1/z. but wait, here n=1, but in the problem, we have n=85. however, since they gave z + 1/z, perhaps we can use a recurrence. let me recall that for a_n = z^n + 1/z^n, we can use the identity:
a_{n+1} = (z^{n+1} + 1/z^{n+1}) = (z + 1/z)(z^n + 1/z^n) - (z^{n-1} + 1/z^{n-1}) = (a_1)(a_n) - a_{n-1}
so the recurrence is a_{n+1} = a_1 a_n - a_{n-1}
therefore, if we can compute a_n using this recurrence, we can find a_{85}. but computing up to 85 terms seems tedious. however, maybe there is periodicity or some pattern that repeats. alternatively, maybe we can find a lower exponent that has a small cycle.
alternatively, perhaps the minimal polynomial of z is known, and we can find z^k in terms of lower exponents.
wait, let's think about minimal polynomials. given z + 1/z = (1 + sqrt(5))/2, we can multiply both sides by z to get a quadratic equation:
z^2 - ( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ) z + 1 = 0
so the minimal polynomial of z is z^2 - ( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ) z + 1 = 0. therefore, z satisfies the equation z^2 - ( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ) z + 1 = 0. therefore, for any integer n ≥ 2, we can express z^n in terms of lower exponents using this recurrence.
specifically, from the equation, we can write z^2 = ( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ) z - 1. then, multiplying both sides by z^{n-1}, we get z^{n+1} = ( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ) z^n - z^{n-1}. therefore, z^{n+1} = ( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ) z^n - z^{n-1}. thus, this gives a recurrence relation for z^n. however, we need z^{85} + 1/z^{85}, which relates to a_n as defined earlier.
since a_{n} = z^n + 1/z^n, we can use the recurrence a_{n+1} = ( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ) a_n - a_{n-1}. this is the same as the previous recurrence because:
a_{n+1} = z^{n+1} + 1/z^{n+1} = [ ( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ) z^n - z^{n-1} ] + [ ( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ) (1/z^{n-1}) - (1/z^{n+1}) ] ? wait, maybe i need to think differently. let me note that since z satisfies z^2 - ( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ) z +1 =0, then so does 1/z, since if we divide the equation by z^2, we get 1 - ( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ) (1/z ) + (1/z^2 ) = 0, so (1/z)^2 - ( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 )(1/z) +1 =0. therefore, z and 1/z are roots of the same quadratic. therefore, the same recurrence relation applies to both z and 1/z.
therefore, the sequence a_n = z^n + 1/z^n satisfies the linear recurrence:
a_{n} = ( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ) a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}
for n ≥ 2, with initial conditions a_0 = 2 (since z^0 + 1/z^0 = 2), a_1 = (1 + sqrt(5))/2.
wait, but we need to be careful with the indices. let's check:
the recurrence is a_{n} = ( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ) a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}
so, for n=2:
a_2 = ( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ) a_1 - a_0
compute a_2:
if z + 1/z = (1 + sqrt(5))/2, then squaring both sides:
(z + 1/z)^2 = [ (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ]^2
z^2 + 2 + 1/z^2 = (1 + 2 sqrt(5) + 5)/4 = (6 + 2 sqrt(5))/4 = (3 + sqrt(5))/2
therefore, z^2 + 1/z^2 = (3 + sqrt(5))/2 - 2 = (3 + sqrt(5) - 4)/2 = (-1 + sqrt(5))/2
but according to the recurrence:
a_2 = ( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ) * ( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ) - a_0 = [ (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ]^2 - 2
which is (1 + 2 sqrt(5) + 5)/4 - 2 = (6 + 2 sqrt(5))/4 - 2 = (3 + sqrt(5))/2 - 2 = (-1 + sqrt(5))/2. which matches. so the recurrence holds.
therefore, the recurrence works. so, in order to compute a_{85}, we can use this linear recurrence. however, computing up to 85 terms is impractical by hand. therefore, we need to find a pattern or periodicity in the sequence a_n.
alternatively, since the recurrence is linear and homogeneous, we can solve it explicitly. the characteristic equation is:
t^2 - ( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ) t + 1 = 0
which is the same quadratic equation as satisfied by z. therefore, the roots are z and 1/z. therefore, the general solution is:
a_n = a z^n + b (1/z)^n
but we know that a_n = z^n + 1/z^n, so in fact, this is exactly the case where a = b = 1. hence, the formula is already given. so we don't need to solve for a and b. therefore, the sequence a_n is exactly z^n + 1/z^n.
but this doesn't necessarily help us compute a_{85} easily. alternatively, perhaps we can note that the sequence a_n is periodic. but with what period?
alternatively, since the problem gives the field of mathematics as abstract algebra, perhaps we need to consider this recurrence in a certain ring or field where computations can be done more easily.
alternatively, maybe the powers of z can be related to some algebraic integers or roots of unity, but given that the minimal polynomial is related to the golden ratio, which is a quadratic irrationality, perhaps we can exploit properties of the golden ratio or the associated algebraic number field.
alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that (1 + sqrt(5))/2 is a root of the polynomial x^2 - x - 1 = 0, which is the minimal polynomial over the rationals. therefore, the coefficients in the recurrence are related to this polynomial.
wait, the recurrence for a_n is:
a_n = ( (1 + sqrt(5))/2 ) a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}
but since (1 + sqrt(5))/2 is a root of x^2 - x - 1, let's denote φ = (1 + sqrt(5))/2, so φ^2 = φ + 1. therefore, perhaps we can manipulate the recurrence using properties of φ.
let me note that φ satisfies φ^2 = φ + 1, and also 1/φ = φ - 1, since φ - 1 = (1 + sqrt(5))/2 -1 = (-1 + sqrt(5))/2.
also, φ * (φ -1 ) = 1.
alternatively, maybe we can express a_n in terms of fibonacci numbers. because φ is closely related to the fibonacci sequence.
recall that the fibonacci numbers satisfy f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2} with f_0=0, f_1=1, and the closed-form formula (binet's formula):
f_n = (φ^n - (1 - φ)^n) / sqrt(5)
but here, our a_n is similar to the expression φ^n + (1/φ)^n. wait, indeed:
φ^n + (1/φ)^n = φ^n + (φ -1)^n
so, φ^n + (1 - φ)^n. but binet's formula relates this to the lucas numbers, which are defined as l_n = φ^n + (1 - φ)^n. wait, yes! lucas numbers are defined by l_n = φ^n + (1 - φ)^n, which is similar to our a_n. wait, but in our case, a_n = z^n + (1/z)^n. if z is φ, then 1/z is 1/φ = φ -1. so if z = φ, then a_n = l_n. however, in our problem, z is a complex number on the unit circle, whereas φ is a real number. hmm, but maybe there is a connection.
wait, but in our problem, z is a complex number with modulus 1, such that z + 1/z = φ. so z is not φ, because φ is a real number greater than 1. so perhaps this is a different context. but maybe the relation still holds.
alternatively, perhaps the sequence a_n can be expressed in terms of fibonacci or lucas numbers. let's check.
given that φ is a root of x^2 - x -1, and satisfies φ^2 = φ +1, so φ^n = f_n φ + f_{n-1} (by the property of fibonacci numbers). similarly, (1 - φ)^n = f_n (1 - φ) + f_{n-1} (-1)^n. but perhaps not directly applicable here.
wait, given that a_n = z^n + 1/z^n and z satisfies z + 1/z = φ. so, if we let z = φ, but then 1/z would be φ -1, but φ is greater than 1, so 1/z is a positive real number. however, in our problem, z is a complex number on the unit circle, so 1/z is the conjugate. so this is a different setting. so perhaps connecting to lucas numbers is not straightforward.
alternatively, maybe using the fact that φ^2 = φ +1, so powers of φ can be expressed in terms of lower fibonacci numbers, but again, since our z is not φ, but related to φ.
alternatively, since we can relate the recurrence to fibonacci numbers. let me check the recurrence for a_n:
a_n = φ a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}
but fibonacci numbers satisfy f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2}
however, our recurrence is a linear recurrence with coefficients φ and -1.
alternatively, perhaps we can express a_n in terms of fibonacci numbers scaled by some factor. let me check for small n:
a_0 = 2
a_1 = φ
a_2 = φ * φ - 2 = φ^2 -1. but φ^2 = φ +1, so φ^2 -1 = φ. so a_2 = φ
a_3 = φ * a_2 - a_1 = φ^2 - φ = (φ +1) - φ =1
a_4 = φ * a_3 - a_2 = φ *1 - φ = φ - φ =0
a_5 = φ * a_4 - a_3 = φ*0 -1 = -1
a_6 = φ*(-1) -0 = -φ
a_7 = φ*(-φ) - (-1) = -φ^2 +1 = -(φ +1) +1 = -φ
a_8 = φ*(-φ) - (-φ) = -φ^2 + φ = - (φ +1 ) + φ = -1
a_9 = φ*(-1) - (-φ) = -φ + φ=0
a_10= φ*0 - (-1)=1
a_11= φ*1 -0=φ
a_12= φ*φ -1= φ^2 -1=φ
a_13= φ*φ - φ= same as a3?
wait, let me compute step by step:
given recurrence a_n = φ a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}
starting with:
a_0 = 2
a_1 = φ
a_2 = φ * a_1 - a_0 = φ^2 - 2 = (φ +1) -2 = φ -1 ≈ 1.618 -1 ≈ 0.618
but wait, earlier, when i thought a_2 = φ, that was incorrect. wait:
wait φ a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}
for n=2: φ a_1 - a_0 = φ * φ - a_0 = φ^2 - 2. since φ^2 = φ +1, so φ^2 -2 = (φ +1) -2 = φ -1. so a_2 = φ -1 ≈ 0.618
a_3 = φ a_2 - a_1 = φ(φ -1) - φ = (φ^2 - φ) - φ = (φ +1 - φ ) - φ = 1 - φ ≈ 1 -1.618 ≈ -0.618
a_4 = φ a_3 - a_2 = φ(1 - φ) - (φ -1) = φ - φ^2 - φ +1 = (φ - φ) - φ^2 +1 = -φ^2 +1 = -(φ +1) +1 = -φ
a_5 = φ a_4 - a_3 = φ(-φ) - (1 - φ) = -φ^2 -1 + φ = - (φ +1) -1 + φ = -φ -1 -1 + φ = -2
a_6 = φ a_5 - a_4 = φ(-2) - (-φ) = -2φ + φ = -φ
a_7 = φ a_6 - a_5 = φ(-φ) - (-2) = -φ^2 +2 = - (φ +1) +2 = -φ +1
a_8 = φ a_7 - a_6 = φ(-φ +1) - (-φ) = -φ^2 + φ + φ = - (φ +1) + 2φ = φ -1
a_9 = φ a_8 - a_7 = φ(φ -1) - (-φ +1) = φ^2 - φ + φ -1 = φ^2 -1 = (φ +1) -1 = φ
a_10= φ a_9 - a_8 = φ*φ - (φ -1) = φ^2 - φ +1 = (φ +1) - φ +1 = 2
a_11= φ a_10 - a_9 = φ*2 - φ = φ
a_12= φ a_11 - a_10 = φ*φ - 2 = same as a_2=φ^2 -2=φ-1
so here, at n=10, a_10=2, which was a_0. and a_11=φ, which was a_1. so the sequence repeats every 10 terms. therefore, the period is 10. therefore, the sequence a_n is periodic with period 10.
therefore, since 85 mod 10 is 5, because 85 divided by 10 is 8 with remainder 5. therefore, a_{85} = a_5 = -2.
hence, the final answer is -2.
**final answer**
\boxed{-2}
</think>

answer: given the problem to solve for \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \) where \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we start by recognizing that \( z \) can be expressed in polar form as \( e^{i\theta} \) such that \( 2 \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \). this implies \( \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \).

we define \( a_n = z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} \) and note that this sequence satisfies the recurrence relation:
\[
a_{n} = \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right) a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}
\]
with initial conditions \( a_0 = 2 \) and \( a_1 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

by computing the first few terms of the sequence, we observe the periodicity:
\[
\begin{align*}
a_0 & = 2, \\
a_1 & = \phi, \\
a_2 & = \phi - 1, \\
a_3 & = 1 - \phi, \\
a_4 & = -\phi, \\
a_5 & = -2, \\
a_6 & = -\phi, \\
a_7 & = -\phi + 1, \\
a_8 & = -1, \\
a_9 & = 0, \\
a_{10} & = 2, \\
a_{11} & = \phi, \\
& \vdots
\end{align*}
\]
we find that the sequence repeats every 10 terms. therefore, the sequence \( a_n \) is periodic with period 10.

to find \( a_{85} \), we compute \( 85 \mod 10 \), which gives 5. thus, \( a_{85} = a_5 = -2 \).

the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{-2}
\]
