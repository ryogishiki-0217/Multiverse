Okay, so I need to find the minimum value of the expression \(\frac{(x + 5)(x + 2)}{x + 1}\) for \(x > 0\). Hmm, let's see. I remember that to find the minimum or maximum of a function, taking the derivative and setting it to zero is a good approach. But before jumping into calculus, maybe I can simplify the expression first.
Let's think in parallel.

1: The numerator of the expression is \((x + 5)(x + 2)\). Expanding this product yields \(x^2 + 7x + 10\). The expression then becomes \(\frac{x^2 + 7x + 10}{x + 1}\).
</Path>
<Path>
2: Substituting \(y = x + 1\) is considered, which transforms the denominator into \(y\). This substitution also requires expressing the numerator in terms of \(y\). The numerator \((x+5)(x+2)\) can be rewritten as \((y-1+5)(y-1+2)\), simplifying to \((y+4)(y+1)\). This substitution transforms the original expression into \(\frac{(y+4)(y+1)}{y}\), which is equivalent to \(\frac{y^2 + 5y + 4}{y}\), or \(y + 5 + \frac{4}{y}\). With \(y = x + 1\) and \(x > 0\), it follows that \(y > 1\). The problem is thus transformed into finding the minimum value of \(y + 5 + \frac{4}{y}\) for \(y > 1\).

3: The possibility of applying an algebraic identity or the AM-GM inequality is explored. The expression is examined to see if it can be represented as a square plus a constant.

<Conclusion>
Simplification of the numerator results in the expression \(x^2 + 7x + 10\). Substituting \(y = x + 1\) transforms the problem into minimizing \(y + 5 + \frac{4}{y}\) for \(y > 1\). Exploring the application of algebraic identities or the AM-GM inequality is also considered.

The original expression is now \(y + 5 + \frac{4}{y}\) with \(y > 1\). Let me write that as \(f(y) = y + 5 + \frac{4}{y}\). To find its minimum, taking the derivative sounds good. Alternatively, since there's a term \(y\) and a term \(4/y\), maybe AM-GM inequality can be applied? Let me recall, AM-GM says for positive real numbers, their arithmetic mean is at least their geometric mean, with equality if all numbers are equal. So, if I consider \(y\) and \(4/y\), their sum is \(y + 4/y\). The AM-GM would say \(\frac{y + 4/y}{2} \geq \sqrt{y \cdot 4/y}\), which simplifies to \(\frac{y + 4/y}{2} \geq \sqrt{4} = 2\). Therefore, \(y + 4/y \geq 4\), with equality when \(y = 4/y\), so \(y^2 = 4\), hence \(y = 2\) (since \(y > 0\)). Therefore, the minimum of \(y + 4/y\) is 4, achieved at \(y=2\). But in our function \(f(y) = y + 5 + 4/y\), there's an extra 5. So if \(y + 4/y \geq 4\), then adding 5 gives \(f(y) \geq 4 + 5 = 9\). So is the minimum 9? But wait, when does equality occur? It occurs when \(y=2\), which is in the domain \(y > 1\). So plugging \(y=2\) into \(f(y)\), we get \(2 + 5 + 4/2 = 2 + 5 + 2 = 9\). So yes, the minimum value of \(f(y)\) is 9 when \(y=2\). Therefore, the minimum value of the original expression is 9. But let me confirm this with derivative test as well, to ensure consistency. Let's compute \(f'(y)\): Given \(f(y) = y + 5 + 4/y\), so \(f'(y) = 1 - 4/y^2\). Setting derivative to zero: \(1 - 4/y^2 = 0\), which gives \(1 = 4/y^2\), so \(y^2 = 4\), hence \(y = 2\) (since \(y > 1\), disregard negative solutions). To confirm it's a minimum, we can check the second derivative: \(f''(y) = 8/y^3\). At \(y=2\), \(f''(2) = 8/(8) = 1 > 0\), so it is indeed a local minimum. Therefore, the minimum value occurs at \(y=2\), giving \(f(2) = 2 + 5 + 2 = 9\). So even though the original variable is \(x > 0\), converting back, since \(y = x + 1\), then \(x = y - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1\), which is positive, so it's valid. Therefore, the minimum value is 9. Alternatively, just to ensure there are no mistakes, let's check the value at \(x=1\): Original expression is \(\frac{(1 + 5)(1 + 2)}{1 + 1} = \frac{6 \cdot 3}{2} = 9\), which matches. So that's correct. Wait, but let me think again. When I applied AM-GM to \(y + 4/y\), I got it's >=4, hence adding 5 gives >=9. However, AM-GM applies when all terms are positive, which they are here, since \(y > 1\). Also, equality holds when \(y = 4/y\), which gives \(y=2\), as before. Since \(y=2\) is achievable in the domain \(y > 1\), then 9 is indeed the minimum. Alternatively, if there was a constraint that made \(y=2\) impossible, but here it's allowed. So yes, the minimum is 9. Alternatively, someone might think that since x >0, maybe the function is decreasing then increasing, so the critical point is a minimum. The derivative approach confirmed that. Alternatively, plotting the function would show a minimum at x=1. But since I can't plot here, but given the calculations match, I think it's safe to conclude the minimum is 9. Wait, just to be thorough, let's check the value of the function at another point to see if it's indeed higher. For example, let's take x=2. Then the original expression becomes \(\frac{(2+5)(2+2)}{2+1} = \frac{7 \cdot 4}{3} = 28/3 ≈9.333... which is greater than 9. Similarly, if x=0.5 (allowed since x>0), then \(\frac{(0.5+5)(0.5+2)}{0.5+1} = \frac{5.5 \cdot 2.5}{1.5} = \frac{13.75}{1.5} ≈9.166..., which is also greater than 9. So in both ends, the function is higher, supporting that the minimum is indeed 9 at x=1. Therefore, I'm confident the answer is 9.
the final answer is \boxed{9}

Answer: To find the minimum value of \(\frac{(x + 5)(x + 2)}{x + 1}\) for \(x > 0\), we start by simplifying the expression. Let \(y = x + 1\), which transforms the problem into minimizing \(y + 5 + \frac{4}{y}\) for \(y > 1\). 

We consider the function \(f(y) = y + 5 + \frac{4}{y}\). To find its minimum, we take the derivative:
\[
f'(y) = 1 - \frac{4}{y^2}
\]
Setting the derivative to zero gives:
\[
1 - \frac{4}{y^2} = 0 \implies y^2 = 4 \implies y = 2 \quad (\text{since } y > 1)
\]

We verify this is a minimum using the second derivative:
\[
f''(y) = \frac{8}{y^3}
\]
At \(y = 2\), \(f''(2) = 1 > 0\), confirming a local minimum.

Evaluating \(f(y)\) at \(y = 2\):
\[
f(2) = 2 + 5 + \frac{4}{2} = 2 + 5 + 2 = 9
\]

Thus, the minimum value of the original expression is \(\boxed{9}\).

answer: to find the minimum value of \(\frac{(x + 5)(x + 2)}{x + 1}\) for \(x > 0\), we start by simplifying the expression. let \(y = x + 1\), which transforms the problem into minimizing \(y + 5 + \frac{4}{y}\) for \(y > 1\). 

we consider the function \(f(y) = y + 5 + \frac{4}{y}\). to find its minimum, we take the derivative:
\[
f'(y) = 1 - \frac{4}{y^2}
\]
setting the derivative to zero gives:
\[
1 - \frac{4}{y^2} = 0 \implies y^2 = 4 \implies y = 2 \quad (\text{since } y > 1)
\]

we verify this is a minimum using the second derivative:
\[
f''(y) = \frac{8}{y^3}
\]
at \(y = 2\), \(f''(2) = 1 > 0\), confirming a local minimum.

evaluating \(f(y)\) at \(y = 2\):
\[
f(2) = 2 + 5 + \frac{4}{2} = 2 + 5 + 2 = 9
\]

thus, the minimum value of the original expression is \(\boxed{9}\)
