Okay, let's see. The problem is about Susan and Pam buying tickets to a show with different discounts, and we need to find out how much more Pam pays than Susan. First, I need to break down the information given.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: Determine the full price per ticket.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: Determine the number of tickets Susan purchases and her discount percentage.
</Outline>
<Outline>
3: Determine the number of tickets Pam purchases and her discount percentage.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The full price of one ticket is $20.
</Path>
<Path>
2: Susan purchases 4 tickets and utilizes a 25% discount.
</Path>
<Path>
3: Pam purchases 5 tickets and receives a 30% discount on the full price.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The full ticket price is $20. Susan buys 4 tickets with a 25% discount, and Pam buys 5 tickets with a 30% discount.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So we have two people, Susan and Pam, each buying a different number of tickets with different discounts. We need to compute how much more Pam pays compared to Susan.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: The cost of 4 tickets for Susan after applying a 25% discount.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: The cost of 5 tickets for Pam after applying a 30% discount.

</Goal>
<Path>
1: The calculation begins with determining the cost for both Susan and Pam.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1.1: The total full price for 4 tickets.
</Outline>
<Outline>
1.2: The total full price for 5 tickets.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1.1: The full price for 4 tickets, purchased by Susan, is $20 multiplied by 4, which equals $80.
</Path>
<Path>
1.2: The total full price for 5 tickets is $100.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The total full price for 4 tickets is $80, and for 5 tickets is $100.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Susan's discount is 25%, so she pays 75% of the total price. Similarly, Pam's discount is 30%, so she pays 70% of the total price.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1.1: The cost for Susan after applying her 25% discount to the full price of $80.
</Outline>

1.1: The calculation for Susan involves applying her 25% discount to her total full price of $80, resulting in a payment of 75% of $80. This amount is computed as $80 multiplied by 0.75, yielding $60.
</Path>
<Path>
1.2: The amount Pam pays is $100 multiplied by 70%, resulting in $70.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
Susan's total cost after her 25% discount is $60, and Pam's total cost after her 30% discount is $70.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
</Path>
<Path>
2: The calculation for the total cost of 5 tickets for Pam, who receives a 30% discount on the full price of $20 per ticket, is performed.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
2.1: The discount amount per ticket for Pam.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2.2: The discounted price per ticket for Pam.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
2.1: The 30% discount on a $20 ticket results in a discount amount of 0.30 * $20 = $6 per ticket.
</Path>
<Path>
2.2: The price per ticket for Pam, after applying her 30% discount to the $20 full price, is calculated as $20 - $6 = $14.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The discount per ticket for Pam is $6, and the resulting discounted price per ticket is $14.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
The total cost for Pam is the product of her discounted price per ticket ($14) and the number of tickets she buys (5), which is $14 * 5 = $70.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
Susan's total cost for 4 tickets after her 25% discount is $60, and Pam's total cost for 5 tickets after her 30% discount is $70.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So Susan pays $60 and Pam pays $70. The question is, how many more dollars does Pam pay than Susan? That's just the difference between Pam's total and Susan's total. So $70 - $60 = $10. Therefore, Pam pays $10 more than Susan.
But let me confirm again. Maybe I made a mistake in calculations.
Let's think in parallel.

Yes, that's correct. So $70 - $60 = $10. So the answer should be 10 dollars. Wait, but let me check again. Sometimes when calculating discounts, you have to make sure you're not compounding them or anything, but no, each ticket's discount is applied individually here, right? Because they're buying multiple tickets, but the discount is on each ticket. So Susan gets each ticket at 25% off, so each ticket is $20 * 0.75 = $15. Then 4 tickets would be $15 * 4 = $60. Same with Pam: each ticket is $20 * 0.70 = $14, so 5 tickets are $14 *5 = $70. Right. So difference is $10. Alternatively, you could compute how much discount each got in total and then subtract, but maybe that's more complicated. Let's see: For Susan, without discount, 4 tickets would be $80. With 25% discount, the savings would be 25% of $80, which is $20. So she pays $80 - $20 = $60. Similarly, for Pam, without discount, 5 tickets would be $100. 30% discount is $30 off, so she pays $70. So yeah, $70 - $60 = $10. Same result. So that's correct. Alternatively, compute per ticket first. Let's see: Original price per ticket is $20. Susan's price per ticket: 25% discount, so $20 * 0.75 = $15. 4 tickets at $15 each is $60. Pam's price per ticket: 30% discount, so $20 * 0.70 = $14. 5 tickets at $14 each is $70. Difference is $10. So all methods lead to the same answer, which reassures me it's correct. Wait, but let me check one more time. Let's compute step by step: - Susan buys 4 tickets at 25% off. Each ticket's discounted price: $20 - (25% of $20) = $20 - $5 = $15. 4 x $15 = $60. - Pam buys 5 tickets at 30% off. Each ticket's discounted price: $20 - (30% of $20) = $20 - $6 = $14. 5 x $14 = $70. - Difference: $70 - $60 = $10. So yes, seems definite. Therefore, the answer is 10. Wait, but the problem says "how many more dollars does Pam pay than Susan?" So if Pam paid $70 and Susan paid $60, Pam pays $10 more. So the final answer is 10 dollars. Wait, the problem is giving the ticket price as \$20 at full price. All the calculations are done in dollars. Does the answer need the dollar sign? The original problem says "how many more dollars...". So the answer should be in dollars. But when they say "how many more dollars", sometimes people answer just the number. But according to the instructions here, the user wants the exact phrase "the final answer is ..." followed by the actual answer. The original problem has the dollar signs in the problem statement. Let's see the exact problem: "One ticket to a show costs \$20 at full price. Susan buys 4 tickets using a coupon that gives her a 25% discount. Pam buys 5 tickets using a coupon that gives her a 30% discount. How many more dollars does Pam pay than Susan?" So the answer should be a number followed by "dollars", and the format should be "the final answer is ... dollars". Wait, the original problem has the price as \$20, which is written with the dollar sign. So when they say "how many more dollars", the unit is dollars, so the answer would be 10 dollars. But according to the user's instruction, the answer should be written as "the final answer is 10 dollars". However, sometimes in math problems, when it's asking "how many more dollars", the answer is just the number, but given the problem uses dollars, it's better to include the unit. Let me check the problem again. The original question ends with "how many more dollars does Pam pay than Susan?" So they expect just the numerical value followed by 'dollars', so the final answer is ten dollars, but written in the required format, it should be "the final answer is 10 dollars". However, maybe the system requires just numbers, but the initial problem has the dollar signs in LaTeX. Hmm, but the user said to put the answer in the format "the final answer is ..." So following the user's instruction, I need to write the final answer with the exact phrase "the final answer is ..." then the number and the word 'dollars' because the question asks for "how many more dollars...". So I think "the final answer is 10 dollars" is what is required. But to confirm: In the problem statement, the ticket price is given as \$20, which uses the dollar sign. However, when the question says "how many more dollars..." do they expect the answer to have the dollar sign or just the word? The way the question is written, "how many more dollars...", the word 'dollars' is part of the question. So the answer would be "Pam pays 10 dollars more than Susan" or simply "10 dollars". Therefore, including the word 'dollars' in the answer. So following the user's instruction, the final answer should be written as "the final answer is 10 dollars". But let me check if the problem has trick parts. Wait, suppose someone misreads the problem and calculates how much Susan and Pam paid per ticket and subtracts without multiplying by the number of tickets. For example, miscomputing the per-ticket price difference and multiplying by their respective quantities. Let's check that. If someone says, okay, Susan's discount is 25%, Pam's is 30%, so the difference per ticket is 5% of $20, which is $1. Then since Susan bought 4 tickets and Pam bought 5, compare (5 - 4) * $1? That's wrong, right? No, that line of thinking is incorrect. Because the question is how much more dollars Pam paid compared to Susan, in total. So you need to compute their total payments and subtract. The correct method is to compute each person's total cost and find the difference. The per-ticket discount percentages affect the total cost, but you can't directly subtract the percentages. For example, if they bought the same number of tickets, then you could compute per-ticket cost difference and multiply by the number, but since they bought different numbers, the calculation must take that into account. Alternatively, someone might think to compute how much money each saved compared to the original price and do some comparison, but that's not necessary here. The key is to compute what each paid and find the difference. Another possible mistake: Suppose someone miscalculates the discount. For example, mistakenly calculating Susan's total as 25% of $80, which is $20, so she pays $60. Then Pam's 30% discount on $100 is $30, so she pays $70. Then the difference is $10. So that's correct. But if someone mistakenly added the discount instead of subtracting, that would be wrong. Alternatively, if someone mistakenly calculated the discounted price as original minus (discount percentage times discounted price), that would be a circular calculation error. But no, the discounts here are all based on the original price. So as long as you calculate correctly, you get the right answer. Alternatively, suppose someone does: Wait, original price for Susan is 4 * $20 = $80. Discount is 25%, so amount paid is 75% of $80: $80 * 0.75 = $60. For Pam, original price is 5 * $20 = $100. Discount is 30%, so amount paid is 70% of $100: $100 * 0.70 = $70. Therefore, the difference is $70 - $60 = $10. Same answer. So that's another way to think about it. Take the original total cost, multiply by (100% - discount percentage). So that's correct. Therefore, I'm quite confident the answer is 10 dollars. Therefore, following the user's instruction, I need to write "the final answer is 10 dollars". Wait, but just to be thorough, let's check once again with another method. Let's compute how much total discount each received. For Susan: original price $80, discount 25%, so $20 discount. For Pam: original price $100, discount 30%, so $30 discount. So Susan paid $80 - $20 = $60, Pam paid $100 - $30 = $70. The difference in what they paid is $70 - $60 = $10. Alternatively, the difference in discounts: Susan saved $20, Pam saved $30. The difference in savings is $10, which is the same as the difference in what they paid. Because total amount paid by both is ($80 - $20) + ($100 - $30) = $60 + $70 = $130. If they had paid the same amount, the total would be different. But in any case, the answer is $10. So, after verifying through multiple methods, I can confidently state the answer is 10 dollars.

Answer: The problem involves calculating how much more Pam pays than Susan for their respective tickets with discounts. 

First, we determine the total cost for Susan:
- Susan buys 4 tickets at a 25% discount.
- The original total cost for Susan is \( 4 \times \$20 = \$80 \).
- With a 25% discount, Susan pays 75% of the original price: \( \$80 \times 0.75 = \$60 \).

Next, we calculate the total cost for Pam:
- Pam buys 5 tickets at a 30% discount.
- The original total cost for Pam is \( 5 \times \$20 = \$100 \).
- With a 30% discount, Pam pays 70% of the original price: \( \$100 \times 0.70 = \$70 \).

Finally, we find the difference between what Pam and Susan paid:
- The difference is \( \$70 - \$60 = \$10 \).

Thus, Pam pays \$10 more than Susan.

\[
\boxed{10}
\]

**Final Answer**
The final answer is \boxed{10} dollars.

that's wrong, right? no, that line of thinking is incorrect. because the question is how much more dollars pam paid compared to susan, in total. so you need to compute their total payments and subtract. the correct method is to compute each person's total cost and find the difference. the per-ticket discount percentages affect the total cost, but you can't directly subtract the percentages. for example, if they bought the same number of tickets, then you could compute per-ticket cost difference and multiply by the number, but since they bought different numbers, the calculation must take that into account. alternatively, someone might think to compute how much money each saved compared to the original price and do some comparison, but that's not necessary here. the key is to compute what each paid and find the difference. another possible mistake: suppose someone miscalculates the discount. for example, mistakenly calculating susan's total as 25% of $80, which is $20, so she pays $60. then pam's 30% discount on $100 is $30, so she pays $70. then the difference is $10. so that's correct. but if someone mistakenly added the discount instead of subtracting, that would be wrong. alternatively, if someone mistakenly calculated the discounted price as original minus (discount percentage times discounted price), that would be a circular calculation error. but no, the discounts here are all based on the original price. so as long as you calculate correctly, you get the right answer. alternatively, suppose someone does: wait, original price for susan is 4 * $20 = $80. discount is 25%, so amount paid is 75% of $80: $80 * 0.75 = $60. for pam, original price is 5 * $20 = $100. discount is 30%, so amount paid is 70% of $100: $100 * 0.70 = $70. therefore, the difference is $70 - $60 = $10. same answer. so that's another way to think about it. take the original total cost, multiply by (100% - discount percentage). so that's correct. therefore, i'm quite confident the answer is 10 dollars. therefore, following the user's instruction, i need to write "the final answer is 10 dollars". wait, but just to be thorough, let's check once again with another method. let's compute how much total discount each received. for susan: original price $80, discount 25%, so $20 discount. for pam: original price $100, discount 30%, so $30 discount. so susan paid $80 - $20 = $60, pam paid $100 - $30 = $70. the difference in what they paid is $70 - $60 = $10. alternatively, the difference in discounts: susan saved $20, pam saved $30. the difference in savings is $10, which is the same as the difference in what they paid. because total amount paid by both is ($80 - $20) + ($100 - $30) = $60 + $70 = $130. if they had paid the same amount, the total would be different. but in any case, the answer is $10. so, after verifying through multiple methods, i can confidently state the answer is 10 dollars.

answer: the problem involves calculating how much more pam pays than susan for their respective tickets with discounts. 

first, we determine the total cost for susan:
- susan buys 4 tickets at a 25% discount.
- the original total cost for susan is \( 4 \times \$20 = \$80 \).
- with a 25% discount, susan pays 75% of the original price: \( \$80 \times 0.75 = \$60 \).

next, we calculate the total cost for pam:
- pam buys 5 tickets at a 30% discount.
- the original total cost for pam is \( 5 \times \$20 = \$100 \).
- with a 30% discount, pam pays 70% of the original price: \( \$100 \times 0.70 = \$70 \).

finally, we find the difference between what pam and susan paid:
- the difference is \( \$70 - \$60 = \$10 \).

thus, pam pays \$10 more than susan.
