Okay, so I need to find the total surface area in square inches of a cube that has a volume of 1 cubic foot. Hmm, let me think. Alright, first, I remember that the volume of a cube is given by the side length cubed, right? So, V = s3. And the surface area of a cube is 6 times the side squared, SA = 6s2. But here the problem is giving me the volume in cubic feet and wants the surface area in square inches. So, I'll have to convert units somewhere along the line. Let's see.
Let's think in parallel.

1: Determine the side length of the cube using its volume.

2: Determine the surface area of the cube using the side length, considering unit conversion.

1: The volume of the cube is 1 cubic foot, which is equivalent to 1 ft3. The formula for the volume of a cube is V = s3, where 's' is the side length. To find the side length, the cube root of the volume must be calculated. The side length 's' can be determined by taking the cube root of 1 ft3, yielding s = 1 ft. This result indicates that each side of the cube measures 1 foot in length.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The volume of 1 cubic foot is equivalent to 1728 cubic inches. The side length calculated from this volume is s = (1728)^(1/3) inches. The cube root of 1728 is 12, so the side length s is 12 inches.
The surface area is then calculated as 6 times (12 inches) squared.
The calculation yields 6 * 144 in^2, which equals 864 square inches.
This result is consistent with the surface area calculation performed using feet as the initial unit.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The cube's side length is determined to be 1 foot (12 inches) using its volume of 1 cubic foot. The total surface area is calculated as 864 square inches, irrespective of whether the side length is initially found in feet or converted to inches.
</Conclusion>

Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me confirm. If the cube has a side length of 1 foot, which is 12 inches, then each face is 12x12 inches, so the area of one face is 144 square inches. There are 6 faces, so total surface area is 6*144 = 864 square inches. Yes, that seems correct. But the problem said "total surface area, in square inches, of a cube with a volume of 1 cubic foot?" So, the key here was converting the volume from cubic feet to cubic inches, but actually, since we need the side length, we can just take the cube root. Wait, but 1 cubic foot is 1728 cubic inches, and the cube root of 1728 is 12, so the side length is 12 inches. Then compute surface area. So, that's exactly what we did. Alternatively, someone might have tried converting the side length from feet to inches after finding that the side is 1 foot, but in this case, since the volume was 1 cubic foot, the side is 1 foot; 1 foot is 12 inches, so again, same result. Wait, let's think if someone did something different. Suppose someone tried to compute surface area in square feet first. Let's see. If the cube has a volume of 1 cubic foot, then the side length is 1 foot. The surface area would be 6*(1)^2 = 6 square feet. Then convert 6 square feet to square inches. Since 1 square foot is 144 square inches (12*12), then 6*144=864 square inches. So same answer. Either approach works. So both converting the volume to inches first or converting the surface area afterwards, it's consistent. So that gives me confidence that the answer is correct. But let me just check, was there a trick here? Sometimes with units conversion problems, people might mistakenly think that if the volume is 1 cubic foot, then the side length is 1 foot, so surface area is 6 sq feet, and 1 cubic foot is... Wait, no, but the problem didn't mention converting cubic feet to cubic inches in the volume, but rather it's giving the volume in cubic feet and asking for surface area in square inches. So the potential confusion might arise if someone tried to use the volume formula with feet and surface area with inches. But as we saw, if you take the volume in cubic feet, you get side length in feet, which you can convert to inches. Alternatively, convert the volume to cubic inches first, then get side length. Let's check that. 1 cubic foot is 1728 cubic inches. So volume is 1728 in3. Then side length is cube root of 1728, which is 12 in. Then surface area is 6*122 = 6*144=864. So same answer. So all of these approaches lead to the same result, so I think 864 is correct. Let me check again for potential mistakes. Did I miscalculate the cube root? 12*12*12=1728. Yes, 12 squared is 144, times 12 is 1728. Yes, so that's correct. Then 144*6 is 864. Yes. So, no mistakes there. Another thing to be careful about is units consistency. But since we converted the side length to inches right after finding it in feet, that takes care of units. Alternatively, converting surface area afterwards is also valid. Either way, correct. So, conclusion: the surface area is 864 square inches. So the final answer is 864.

Answer: To find the total surface area of a cube with a volume of 1 cubic foot in square inches, we start by determining the side length of the cube. 

1. The volume of a cube is given by \( V = s^3 \). For a volume of 1 cubic foot:
   \[
   s^3 = 1 \implies s = 1 \text{ foot}
   \]
2. Convert the side length from feet to inches:
   \[
   1 \text{ foot} = 12 \text{ inches}
   \]
3. The surface area of a cube is given by \( SA = 6s^2 \). Substituting the side length in inches:
   \[
   SA = 6 \times (12)^2 = 6 \times 144 = 864 \text{ square inches}
   \]

Thus, the total surface area is \(\boxed{864}\) square inches.

The final answer is \boxed{864}.

   \]
3. the surface area of a cube is given by \( sa = 6s^2 \). substituting the side length in inches:
   \[
   sa = 6 \times (12)^2 = 6 \times 144 = 864 \text{ square inches}
