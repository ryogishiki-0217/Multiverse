Okay, so I need to find the product of these eight sine terms: sin 20°, sin 40°, sin 60°, sin 80°, sin 100°, sin 120°, sin 140°, and sin 160°. That seems like a lot, but maybe there's a pattern or some trigonometric identity that can simplify this.
First, let me recall some trigonometric identities that might be useful here.
I remember that the product of sines can sometimes be simplified using multiple-angle formulas or by pairing terms in a clever way.
Also, there's an identity for the product of sines of equally spaced angles, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.
Let me look at the angles given: 20°, 40°, 60°, 80°, 100°, 120°, 140°, 160°.
They are all multiples of 20°, starting from 20° up to 160°, increasing by 20° each time.
That seems regular.
Also, notice that after 80°, the angles start exceeding 90°, which might mean their sine values are decreasing, but not sure if that matters.
Wait, the product is of eight terms, each 20° apart.
Let me see if this is similar to the product of sines of angles from 10° to 80°, which I think there might be a known formula for.
Wait, actually, there is a formula for the product of sines of kπ/(2n) for k = 1 to n-1, something like that.
But here the angles are in degrees, not radians, but I can convert them.
Alternatively, maybe this is related to roots of unity or something from complex numbers.
Hmm.
But perhaps a more straightforward approach.
Let me first note that sin 60° and sin 120° are the only ones here that are part of the well-known sine values.
sin 60° = √3/2, and sin 120° = sin(180° - 60°) = sin 60° = √3/2.
So those two can be computed exactly.
The others, sin 20°, sin 40°, sin 80°, sin 100°, sin 140°, sin 160°, maybe they can be paired or simplified using some identities.
Another thought: use the identity sin θ = cos(90° - θ).
So sin 100° = cos(10°), sin 140° = cos(40°), sin 160° = cos(70°).
Similarly, sin 80° = cos(10°), sin 120° = cos(30°), sin 60° = cos(30°).
Wait, maybe not.
Let's check:
Wait, sin(100°) = sin(90° + 10°) = cos(10°),
sin(140°) = sin(90° + 40°) = cos(40°),
sin(160°) = sin(90° + 70°) = cos(70°).
Wait, actually sin(100°) = sin(90° + 10°) = cos(10°), right?
Because sin(90° + x) = cos(x).
Similarly, sin(140°) = sin(90° + 40°) = cos(40°),
sin(160°) = sin(90° + 70°) = cos(70°).
So replacing the angles over 90° with their cosine equivalents, we have:
sin 20°, sin 40°, sin 60°, sin 80°, cos 10°, cos 30°, cos 40°, cos 70°.
Wait, sin 100° = sin(90 + 10) = cos 10°, which is correct.
Similarly, sin 120° = sin(90 + 30) = cos 30°, but sin 120° is also equal to sin 60°, so cos 30° = sin 60°, which checks out because cos 30° = √3/2 = sin 60°.
Similarly, sin 140° = sin(90 + 40) = cos 40°, and sin 160° = sin(90 + 70) = cos 70°.
So substituting these, the product becomes:
sin 20° * sin 40° * sin 60° * sin 80° * cos 10° * cos 30° * cos 40° * cos 70°.
Hmm, so we have sines from 20°, 40°, 60°, 80°, and cosines of 10°, 30°, 40°, 70°.
Maybe we can pair terms with the same angles?
Let's see:
sin 20° and cos 10°,
sin 40° and cos 40°,
sin 60° and cos 30°,
sin 80° and cos 70°.
Wait, sin 80° = cos 10°, because sin(80°) = cos(10°), right?
Because sin(90° - x) = cos(x), so sin(80°) = cos(10°).
Similarly, sin 60° = cos 30°, so perhaps these can be paired.
Let me write all the terms again:
1. sin 20°
2. sin 40°
3. sin 60°
4. sin 80°
5. cos 10°
6. cos 30°
7. cos 40°
8. cos 70°
Now, sin 60° = √3/2, cos 30° = √3/2, so their product is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4.
Similarly, sin 80° = cos 10°, so their product would be sin 80° * cos 10° = sin 80° * sin 80° = sin280°.
Wait, but in the product, they are separate terms.
Wait, no, the original product has sin 80° and cos 70°.
Wait, sin 80° is term 4, cos 70° is term 8.
So perhaps another pairing.
Alternatively, maybe group them into pairs that can be simplified.
Let's see:
Looking at angles 10°, 20°, 40°, 70° in the cosine terms, but not sure.
Wait, perhaps use the identity sin A cos B = [ sin(A+B) + sin(A-B) ] / 2.
But with multiple terms, not sure if that helps.
Alternatively, maybe use complex numbers or exponential forms.
But that might complicate things.
Wait, another idea.
Since these angles are symmetric around 90°, maybe there's a way to pair them to use complementary angle identities.
For example, sin 20° and sin 160°.
Wait, sin 160° = sin(20°), because 160° = 180° - 20°, so sin 160° = sin 20°.
Similarly, sin 140° = sin 40°, and sin 100° = sin 80°.
But in our product, we already have sin 80°, so sin 100° = sin 80°, so actually, sin 100° = sin 80°.
Wait, but in our product, we have sin 100° as a cosine term, cos 10°, which is equal to sin 80°, so maybe that substitution already happened.
Wait, perhaps not.
Wait, maybe my earlier substitution was incorrect.
Let me check again.
Original product: sin 20°, sin 40°, sin 60°, sin 80°, sin 100°, sin 120°, sin 140°, sin 160°.
So after replacing sin(theta) with sin(180° - theta) where theta > 90°, we get:
sin 20°, sin 40°, sin 60°, sin 80°, sin 80°, sin 60°, sin 40°, sin 20°.
Wait, sin 100° = sin(80°), sin 120° = sin(60°), sin 140° = sin(40°), sin 160° = sin(20°).
So the product becomes:
sin 20° * sin 40° * sin 60° * sin 80° * sin 80° * sin 60° * sin 40° * sin 20°.
So it's [sin 20° * sin 40° * sin 60° * sin 80°] multiplied by itself.
Therefore, the product is [ (sin 20°)(sin 40°)(sin 60°)(sin 80°) ) ]2.
So now the problem reduces to finding the product of these four sines and then squaring it.
That's a significant simplification.
So if I can compute P = sin 20° sin 40° sin 60° sin 80°, then the original product is P2.
So how to compute P?
Let's focus on P = sin 20° sin 40° sin 60° sin 80°.
Again, maybe use product-to-sum identities.
Let me recall that the product of two sines can be expressed as a sum.
So, sin A sin B = [ cos(A - B) - cos(A + B) ] / 2.
Maybe we can apply this formula multiple times.
First, group the sines into pairs.
But which pairs?
Let's see.
We have four terms: 20°, 40°, 60°, 80°.
Perhaps pair 20° with 40°, and 60° with 80°.
Wait, but maybe pairing 20° with 80° and 40° with 60° would be better.
Let me check.
Wait, the product is sin 20° sin 40° sin 60° sin 80°.
If I arrange them in a different order: sin 20° sin 80° times sin 40° sin 60°.
Then compute each pair.
Let's try:
First, compute sin 20° sin 80°.
Using the identity sin A sin B = [ cos(A - B) - cos(A + B) ] / 2.
So A = 20°, B = 80°.
So:
sin 20° sin 80° = [ cos(20° - 80°) - cos(20° + 80°) ] / 2 = [ cos(-60°) - cos(100°) ] / 2.
But cos(-60°) = cos(60°) = 0.5, and cos(100°) is equal to cos(180° - 80°) = -cos(80°).
So:
sin 20° sin 80° = [ 0.5 - (-cos 80° ) ] / 2 = [ 0.5 + cos 80° ] / 2.
Similarly, compute sin 40° sin 60°.
Let A = 40°, B = 60°.
Then:
sin 40° sin 60° = [ cos(40° - 60°) - cos(40° + 60°) ] / 2 = [ cos(-20°) - cos(100°) ] / 2.
Again, cos(-20°) = cos(20°), and cos(100°) = -cos(80°).
Therefore:
sin 40° sin 60° = [ cos20° - (-cos80° ) ] / 2 = [ cos20° + cos80° ] / 2.
So now, P = sin 20° sin 40° sin 60° sin 80° = [ (0.5 + cos80°)/2 ] * [ (cos20° + cos80°)/2 ].
Hmm, so that becomes:
P = [ (0.5 + cos80°)(cos20° + cos80°) ] / 4.
Let's compute this product.
Multiply out the terms:
First, 0.5 * cos20° = 0.5 cos20°.
0.5 * cos80° = 0.5 cos80°.
Then, cos80° * cos20° = cos80° cos20°.
cos80° * cos80° = cos280°.
So altogether:
0.5 cos20° + 0.5 cos80° + cos80° cos20° + cos280°.
So P = [0.5 cos20° + 0.5 cos80° + cos80° cos20° + cos280° ] / 4.
Maybe we can simplify this expression.
Let me see.
First, factor out 0.5 from the first two terms:
0.5 (cos20° + cos80° ) + cos80° cos20° + cos280°.
Hmm, not sure.
Alternatively, note that there's a product of cos80° cos20°, which perhaps can be converted into a sum.
Let's apply the product-to-sum identity again here.
Recall that cos A cos B = [ cos(A + B) + cos(A - B) ] / 2.
So, cos80° cos20° = [ cos(100°) + cos(60°) ] / 2.
Which is equal to [ -cos80° + 0.5 ] because cos(100°) = -cos80°, and cos60° = 0.5.
Therefore:
cos80° cos20° = [ -cos80° + 0.5 ] / 2.
So substituting back into P:
0.5 (cos20° + cos80° ) + [ -cos80° + 0.5 ] / 2 + cos280°.
Let me handle each term:
First term: 0.5 cos20° + 0.5 cos80°.
Second term: (-cos80° + 0.5)/2 = -0.5 cos80° + 0.25.
Third term: cos280°.
So combining all terms:
0.5 cos20° + 0.5 cos80° - 0.5 cos80° + 0.25 + cos280°.
Simplify:
0.5 cos20° + (0.5 cos80° - 0.5 cos80°) + 0.25 + cos280°.
The cos80° terms cancel.
So remaining:
0.5 cos20° + 0.25 + cos280°.
So P = [0.5 cos20° + 0.25 + cos280° ] / 4.
Which is (0.5 cos20° + 0.25 + cos280° ) / 4.
Hmm, this might not be getting simpler.
Let me think of another approach.
Alternatively, perhaps express all angles in terms of 20°, since 20° is the smallest angle here.
Let me denote θ = 20°.
Then we have angles θ, 2θ, 3θ, 4θ.
So P = sin θ sin 2θ sin 3θ sin 4θ, where θ = 20°.
Not sure if there's a product formula for that.
Alternatively, use complex numbers or recursively build the product.
Wait, I remember that the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression can sometimes be expressed using a formula.
For example, the product of sin(kθ) for k from 1 to n-1 can be related to some expression involving n and θ, but I need to recall.
Alternatively, perhaps consider using multiple-angle identities.
Let me think.
Another idea: use the identity sin theta = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).
But not sure if that helps here.
Wait, perhaps write the product P as sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°.
Maybe pair sin20° sin80° and sin40° sin60°.
Wait, but earlier that led to a complicated expression.
Alternatively, use the identity sin A sin B = [cos(A - B) - cos(A + B)] / 2.
Let me try pairing sin20° sin40° and sin60° sin80°.
Compute sin20° sin40°:
Using the identity, A = 20°, B = 40°.
So [cos(20° - 40°) - cos(20° + 40°)] / 2 = [cos(-20°) - cos60°] / 2 = [cos20° - 0.5] / 2.
Similarly, sin60° sin80°:
A = 60°, B = 80°.
[cos(60° - 80°) - cos(60° + 80°)] / 2 = [cos(-20°) - cos140°] / 2 = [cos20° - (-cos40°)] / 2 = [cos20° + cos40°] / 2.
So now, P = ([cos20° - 0.5] / 2) * ([cos20° + cos40°] / 2).
So that's [ (cos20° - 0.5)(cos20° + cos40°) ] / 4.
Let me compute this product:
First term: cos20° * cos20° = cos220°.
Second term: cos20° * cos40° = cos20° cos40°.
Third term: -0.5 * cos20° = -0.5 cos20°.
Fourth term: -0.5 * cos40° = -0.5 cos40°.
So altogether, cos220° + cos20° cos40° - 0.5 cos20° - 0.5 cos40°.
So P = [ cos220° + cos20° cos40° - 0.5 cos20° - 0.5 cos40° ] / 4.
Hmm, this still seems messy.
Maybe we can find another approach.
Wait, let me consider the product P = sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°.
We can use the identity for sin A sin B here multiple times.
Alternatively, perhaps express it as sin20° sin40° sin80° and then multiply by sin60°.
Wait, note that sin60° is √3/2, which is exact.
So perhaps compute the rest multiplied by that.
First, compute Q = sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80° = (sin20° sin80°)(sin40° sin60°).
We already computed sin20° sin80° as [0.5 + cos80°] / 2.
Similarly, sin40° sin60° = [ cos(40° - 60°) - cos(40° + 60°) ] / 2 = [ cos(-20°) - cos100° ] / 2 = [ cos20° + cos80° ] / 2.
So P = ( [0.5 + cos80°]/2 ) * ( [cos20° + cos80°]/2 )
Which is [ (0.5 + cos80°)(cos20° + cos80°) ] / 4.
Let's expand this:
Multiply 0.5 by cos20°: 0.5 cos20°
Multiply 0.5 by cos80°: 0.5 cos80°
Multiply cos80° by cos20°: cos80° cos20°
Multiply cos80° by cos80°: cos280°
So total expression: 0.5 cos20° + 0.5 cos80° + cos80° cos20° + cos280° all over 4.
So P = [0.5 cos20° + 0.5 cos80° + cos80° cos20° + cos280° ] / 4.
Now, perhaps express cos80° cos20° using product-to-sum formula again.
As before, cos80° cos20° = [ cos(100°) + cos(60°) ] / 2 = [ -cos80° + 0.5 ] / 2.
So replace cos80° cos20° with ( -cos80° + 0.5 ) / 2.
Then P becomes:
[0.5 cos20° + 0.5 cos80° + ( -cos80° + 0.5 ) / 2 + cos280° ] / 4.
Multiply the numerator by 2 to eliminate the denominator:
[ 0.5 cos20° * 2 + 0.5 cos80° * 2 + ( -cos80° + 0.5 ) + cos280° * 2 ] / (4*2 )
Wait, maybe better to combine terms:
First, expand the numerator:
0.5 cos20° + 0.5 cos80° + (-cos80° + 0.5)/2 + cos280°
= 0.5 cos20° + 0.5 cos80° - 0.5 cos80° + 0.25 + cos280°
= 0.5 cos20° + (0.5 cos80° - 0.5 cos80°) + 0.25 + cos280°
= 0.5 cos20° + 0.25 + cos280°
Therefore, P = [0.5 cos20° + 0.25 + cos280° ] / 4
= (0.5 cos20° + 0.25 + cos280° ) / 4.
Hmm, this seems as far as we can take it with product-to-sum formulas.
Maybe convert cos280° using a double angle formula.
cos280° = (1 + cos160°)/2.
Similarly, cos20° can be written as 2 cos210° - 1.
Wait, but let's see:
cos2theta = (1 + cos2theta)/2, so cos280° = (1 + cos160°)/2.
Let me substitute that:
P = [0.5*(2 cos210° - 1) + 0.25 + (1 + cos160°)/2 ] / 4.
Wait, wait:
Wait, cos280° = (1 + cos160°)/2.
So replacing cos280°:
P = [0.5 cos20° + 0.25 + (1 + cos160°)/2 ] / 4.
Simplify the numerator:
0.5 cos20° + 0.25 + 0.5 + 0.5 cos160°.
Which is 0.5 cos20° + 0.5 cos160° + 0.75.
So P = [0.5 cos20° + 0.5 cos160° + 0.75 ] / 4.
Factor out 0.5:
0.5[ cos20° + cos160° ] + 0.75 all over 4.
Which is [ 0.5(cos20° + cos160°) + 0.75 ] /4.
Which is [ (cos20° + cos160°)/2 + 0.75 ] /4.
Let me compute cos20° + cos160°.
Using sum-to-product identity:
cos A + cos B = 2 cos[(A+B)/2] cos[(A-B)/2].
So cos20° + cos160° = 2 cos(90°) cos(-70°).
But cos90° = 0, so the whole term becomes zero.
Wait, that's interesting.
Let me check:
cos160° = cos(180° - 20°) = -cos20°.
So cos20° + cos160° = cos20° - cos20° = 0.
Therefore, yes, that term is zero.
Therefore, P = [0 + 0.75]/4 = 0.75 /4 = 0.1875 = 3/16.
Wait, so P = 3/16.
Therefore, the original product is P squared, which is (3/16)^2 = 9/256.
Wait, that seems like a nice round number.
Let me verify my steps here.
So starting over:
Original product: sin20 sin40 sin60 sin80 sin100 sin120 sin140 sin160.
Replace sin100 = sin80, sin120 = sin60, sin140 = sin40, sin160 = sin20.
So the product becomes (sin20 sin40 sin60 sin80)^2.
So compute P = sin20 sin40 sin60 sin80.
After multiple steps, using product formulas, reducing products to sums, and using identities, we found that P = 3/16.
Therefore, squared it's 9/256.
Therefore, the original product is 9/256.
But let me confirm this intermediate step, that P = 3/16.
Because if P is 3/16, then the original product is 9/256.
But is P really equal to 3/16?
Let me check.
So, when we had:
P = [0.5 cos20 + 0.25 + cos280 ] /4.
Then replaced cos280 using the identity, leading to adding cos160 and using the fact that cos20 + cos160 = 0.
Therefore, P = (0.75)/4 = 0.1875 = 3/16.
So that seems correct.
Therefore, P squared is 9/256.
Therefore, the final answer is 9/256.
But just to double-check, let me compute this numerically.
Compute the original product: sin20 sin40 sin60 sin80 sin100 sin120 sin140 sin160.
All angles in degrees.
Convert them to radians for computation:
But maybe use a calculator.
Alternatively, approximate sin20°: 0.3420,
sin40° ≈ 0.6428,
sin60° ≈ 0.8660,
sin80° ≈ 0.9848,
sin100° ≈ 0.9848,
sin120° ≈ 0.8660,
sin140° ≈ 0.6428,
sin160° ≈ 0.3420.
Multiply them all:
First, sin20° * sin160° ≈ 0.3420 * 0.3420 ≈ 0.116964
sin40° * sin140° ≈ 0.6428 * 0.6428 ≈ 0.41341984
sin60° * sin120° ≈ 0.8660 * 0.8660 ≈ 0.750676
sin80° * sin100° ≈ 0.9848 * 0.9848 ≈ 0.96973104
Now, multiply these four products:
0.11644 * 0.41342 * 0.750676 * 0.969731
Compute step by step:
First, 0.11644 * 0.41342 ≈ 0.04809
0.04809 * 0.750676 ≈ 0.03611
0.03611 * 0.969731 ≈ 0.03506
So approximate product is 0.03506.
Now, 9/256 ≈ 9 ÷ 256 ≈ 0.03515625.
Very close.
So that gives me some confidence that the answer is indeed 9/256.
Therefore, the final answer is \boxed{\dfrac{9}{256}}.
**Final Answer** 
\boxed{\dfrac{9}{256}}
</Think>

Answer: To find the product \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\), we start by recognizing that the angles can be paired using co-function identities and properties of sine functions. 

First, we note that:
\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ, \quad \sin 120^\circ = \sin 60^\circ, \quad \sin 140^\circ = \sin 40^\circ, \quad \sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ
\]
Thus, the product can be written as:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2
\]

Next, we focus on calculating \(P = \sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ\). Using the product-to-sum identities and trigonometric simplifications, we find:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\cos 60^\circ + \cos 100^\circ}{2} = \frac{0.5 - \cos 80^\circ}{2}
\]
\[
\sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ = \frac{\cos 20^\circ + \cos 100^\circ}{2} = \frac{\cos 20^\circ - \cos 80^\circ}{2}
\]

Combining these results and simplifying using trigonometric identities, we find that the product \(P\) reduces to:
\[
P = \frac{3}{16}
\]

Thus, the original product is:
\[
\left(\frac{3}{16}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{256}
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\dfrac{9}{256}}
\]

okay, so i need to find the product of these eight sine terms: sin 20°, sin 40°, sin 60°, sin 80°, sin 100°, sin 120°, sin 140°, and sin 160°. that seems like a lot, but maybe there's a pattern or some trigonometric identity that can simplify this.
first, let me recall some trigonometric identities that might be useful here.
i remember that the product of sines can sometimes be simplified using multiple-angle formulas or by pairing terms in a clever way.
also, there's an identity for the product of sines of equally spaced angles, but i'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.
let me look at the angles given: 20°, 40°, 60°, 80°, 100°, 120°, 140°, 160°.
they are all multiples of 20°, starting from 20° up to 160°, increasing by 20° each time.
that seems regular.
also, notice that after 80°, the angles start exceeding 90°, which might mean their sine values are decreasing, but not sure if that matters.
wait, the product is of eight terms, each 20° apart.
let me see if this is similar to the product of sines of angles from 10° to 80°, which i think there might be a known formula for.
wait, actually, there is a formula for the product of sines of kπ/(2n) for k = 1 to n-1, something like that.
but here the angles are in degrees, not radians, but i can convert them.
alternatively, maybe this is related to roots of unity or something from complex numbers.
hmm.
but perhaps a more straightforward approach.
let me first note that sin 60° and sin 120° are the only ones here that are part of the well-known sine values.
sin 60° = √3/2, and sin 120° = sin(180° - 60°) = sin 60° = √3/2.
so those two can be computed exactly.
the others, sin 20°, sin 40°, sin 80°, sin 100°, sin 140°, sin 160°, maybe they can be paired or simplified using some identities.
another thought: use the identity sin θ = cos(90° - θ).
so sin 100° = cos(10°), sin 140° = cos(40°), sin 160° = cos(70°).
similarly, sin 80° = cos(10°), sin 120° = cos(30°), sin 60° = cos(30°).
wait, maybe not.
let's check:
wait, sin(100°) = sin(90° + 10°) = cos(10°),
sin(140°) = sin(90° + 40°) = cos(40°),
sin(160°) = sin(90° + 70°) = cos(70°).
wait, actually sin(100°) = sin(90° + 10°) = cos(10°), right?
because sin(90° + x) = cos(x).
similarly, sin(140°) = sin(90° + 40°) = cos(40°),
sin(160°) = sin(90° + 70°) = cos(70°).
so replacing the angles over 90° with their cosine equivalents, we have:
sin 20°, sin 40°, sin 60°, sin 80°, cos 10°, cos 30°, cos 40°, cos 70°.
wait, sin 100° = sin(90 + 10) = cos 10°, which is correct.
similarly, sin 120° = sin(90 + 30) = cos 30°, but sin 120° is also equal to sin 60°, so cos 30° = sin 60°, which checks out because cos 30° = √3/2 = sin 60°.
similarly, sin 140° = sin(90 + 40) = cos 40°, and sin 160° = sin(90 + 70) = cos 70°.
so substituting these, the product becomes:
sin 20° * sin 40° * sin 60° * sin 80° * cos 10° * cos 30° * cos 40° * cos 70°.
hmm, so we have sines from 20°, 40°, 60°, 80°, and cosines of 10°, 30°, 40°, 70°.
maybe we can pair terms with the same angles?
let's see:
sin 20° and cos 10°,
sin 40° and cos 40°,
sin 60° and cos 30°,
sin 80° and cos 70°.
wait, sin 80° = cos 10°, because sin(80°) = cos(10°), right?
because sin(90° - x) = cos(x), so sin(80°) = cos(10°).
similarly, sin 60° = cos 30°, so perhaps these can be paired.
let me write all the terms again:
1. sin 20°
2. sin 40°
3. sin 60°
4. sin 80°
5. cos 10°
6. cos 30°
7. cos 40°
8. cos 70°
now, sin 60° = √3/2, cos 30° = √3/2, so their product is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4.
similarly, sin 80° = cos 10°, so their product would be sin 80° * cos 10° = sin 80° * sin 80° = sin280°.
wait, but in the product, they are separate terms.
wait, no, the original product has sin 80° and cos 70°.
wait, sin 80° is term 4, cos 70° is term 8.
so perhaps another pairing.
alternatively, maybe group them into pairs that can be simplified.
let's see:
looking at angles 10°, 20°, 40°, 70° in the cosine terms, but not sure.
wait, perhaps use the identity sin a cos b = [ sin(a+b) + sin(a-b) ] / 2.
but with multiple terms, not sure if that helps.
alternatively, maybe use complex numbers or exponential forms.
but that might complicate things.
wait, another idea.
since these angles are symmetric around 90°, maybe there's a way to pair them to use complementary angle identities.
for example, sin 20° and sin 160°.
wait, sin 160° = sin(20°), because 160° = 180° - 20°, so sin 160° = sin 20°.
similarly, sin 140° = sin 40°, and sin 100° = sin 80°.
but in our product, we already have sin 80°, so sin 100° = sin 80°, so actually, sin 100° = sin 80°.
wait, but in our product, we have sin 100° as a cosine term, cos 10°, which is equal to sin 80°, so maybe that substitution already happened.
wait, perhaps not.
wait, maybe my earlier substitution was incorrect.
let me check again.
original product: sin 20°, sin 40°, sin 60°, sin 80°, sin 100°, sin 120°, sin 140°, sin 160°.
so after replacing sin(theta) with sin(180° - theta) where theta > 90°, we get:
sin 20°, sin 40°, sin 60°, sin 80°, sin 80°, sin 60°, sin 40°, sin 20°.
wait, sin 100° = sin(80°), sin 120° = sin(60°), sin 140° = sin(40°), sin 160° = sin(20°).
so the product becomes:
sin 20° * sin 40° * sin 60° * sin 80° * sin 80° * sin 60° * sin 40° * sin 20°.
so it's [sin 20° * sin 40° * sin 60° * sin 80°] multiplied by itself.
therefore, the product is [ (sin 20°)(sin 40°)(sin 60°)(sin 80°) ) ]2.
so now the problem reduces to finding the product of these four sines and then squaring it.
that's a significant simplification.
so if i can compute p = sin 20° sin 40° sin 60° sin 80°, then the original product is p2.
so how to compute p?
let's focus on p = sin 20° sin 40° sin 60° sin 80°.
again, maybe use product-to-sum identities.
let me recall that the product of two sines can be expressed as a sum.
so, sin a sin b = [ cos(a - b) - cos(a + b) ] / 2.
maybe we can apply this formula multiple times.
first, group the sines into pairs.
but which pairs?
let's see.
we have four terms: 20°, 40°, 60°, 80°.
perhaps pair 20° with 40°, and 60° with 80°.
wait, but maybe pairing 20° with 80° and 40° with 60° would be better.
let me check.
wait, the product is sin 20° sin 40° sin 60° sin 80°.
if i arrange them in a different order: sin 20° sin 80° times sin 40° sin 60°.
then compute each pair.
let's try:
first, compute sin 20° sin 80°.
using the identity sin a sin b = [ cos(a - b) - cos(a + b) ] / 2.
so a = 20°, b = 80°.
so:
sin 20° sin 80° = [ cos(20° - 80°) - cos(20° + 80°) ] / 2 = [ cos(-60°) - cos(100°) ] / 2.
but cos(-60°) = cos(60°) = 0.5, and cos(100°) is equal to cos(180° - 80°) = -cos(80°).
so:
sin 20° sin 80° = [ 0.5 - (-cos 80° ) ] / 2 = [ 0.5 + cos 80° ] / 2.
similarly, compute sin 40° sin 60°.
let a = 40°, b = 60°.
then:
sin 40° sin 60° = [ cos(40° - 60°) - cos(40° + 60°) ] / 2 = [ cos(-20°) - cos(100°) ] / 2.
again, cos(-20°) = cos(20°), and cos(100°) = -cos(80°).
therefore:
sin 40° sin 60° = [ cos20° - (-cos80° ) ] / 2 = [ cos20° + cos80° ] / 2.
so now, p = sin 20° sin 40° sin 60° sin 80° = [ (0.5 + cos80°)/2 ] * [ (cos20° + cos80°)/2 ].
hmm, so that becomes:
p = [ (0.5 + cos80°)(cos20° + cos80°) ] / 4.
let's compute this product.
multiply out the terms:
first, 0.5 * cos20° = 0.5 cos20°.
0.5 * cos80° = 0.5 cos80°.
then, cos80° * cos20° = cos80° cos20°.
cos80° * cos80° = cos280°.
so altogether:
0.5 cos20° + 0.5 cos80° + cos80° cos20° + cos280°.
so p = [0.5 cos20° + 0.5 cos80° + cos80° cos20° + cos280° ] / 4.
maybe we can simplify this expression.
let me see.
first, factor out 0.5 from the first two terms:
0.5 (cos20° + cos80° ) + cos80° cos20° + cos280°.
hmm, not sure.
alternatively, note that there's a product of cos80° cos20°, which perhaps can be converted into a sum.
let's apply the product-to-sum identity again here.
recall that cos a cos b = [ cos(a + b) + cos(a - b) ] / 2.
so, cos80° cos20° = [ cos(100°) + cos(60°) ] / 2.
which is equal to [ -cos80° + 0.5 ] because cos(100°) = -cos80°, and cos60° = 0.5.
therefore:
cos80° cos20° = [ -cos80° + 0.5 ] / 2.
so substituting back into p:
0.5 (cos20° + cos80° ) + [ -cos80° + 0.5 ] / 2 + cos280°.
let me handle each term:
first term: 0.5 cos20° + 0.5 cos80°.
second term: (-cos80° + 0.5)/2 = -0.5 cos80° + 0.25.
third term: cos280°.
so combining all terms:
0.5 cos20° + 0.5 cos80° - 0.5 cos80° + 0.25 + cos280°.
simplify:
0.5 cos20° + (0.5 cos80° - 0.5 cos80°) + 0.25 + cos280°.
the cos80° terms cancel.
so remaining:
0.5 cos20° + 0.25 + cos280°.
so p = [0.5 cos20° + 0.25 + cos280° ] / 4.
which is (0.5 cos20° + 0.25 + cos280° ) / 4.
hmm, this might not be getting simpler.
let me think of another approach.
alternatively, perhaps express all angles in terms of 20°, since 20° is the smallest angle here.
let me denote θ = 20°.
then we have angles θ, 2θ, 3θ, 4θ.
so p = sin θ sin 2θ sin 3θ sin 4θ, where θ = 20°.
not sure if there's a product formula for that.
alternatively, use complex numbers or recursively build the product.
wait, i remember that the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression can sometimes be expressed using a formula.
for example, the product of sin(kθ) for k from 1 to n-1 can be related to some expression involving n and θ, but i need to recall.
alternatively, perhaps consider using multiple-angle identities.
let me think.
another idea: use the identity sin theta = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).
but not sure if that helps here.
wait, perhaps write the product p as sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°.
maybe pair sin20° sin80° and sin40° sin60°.
wait, but earlier that led to a complicated expression.
alternatively, use the identity sin a sin b = [cos(a - b) - cos(a + b)] / 2.
let me try pairing sin20° sin40° and sin60° sin80°.
compute sin20° sin40°:
using the identity, a = 20°, b = 40°.
so [cos(20° - 40°) - cos(20° + 40°)] / 2 = [cos(-20°) - cos60°] / 2 = [cos20° - 0.5] / 2.
similarly, sin60° sin80°:
a = 60°, b = 80°.
[cos(60° - 80°) - cos(60° + 80°)] / 2 = [cos(-20°) - cos140°] / 2 = [cos20° - (-cos40°)] / 2 = [cos20° + cos40°] / 2.
so now, p = ([cos20° - 0.5] / 2) * ([cos20° + cos40°] / 2).
so that's [ (cos20° - 0.5)(cos20° + cos40°) ] / 4.
let me compute this product:
first term: cos20° * cos20° = cos220°.
second term: cos20° * cos40° = cos20° cos40°.
third term: -0.5 * cos20° = -0.5 cos20°.
fourth term: -0.5 * cos40° = -0.5 cos40°.
so altogether, cos220° + cos20° cos40° - 0.5 cos20° - 0.5 cos40°.
so p = [ cos220° + cos20° cos40° - 0.5 cos20° - 0.5 cos40° ] / 4.
hmm, this still seems messy.
maybe we can find another approach.
wait, let me consider the product p = sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°.
we can use the identity for sin a sin b here multiple times.
alternatively, perhaps express it as sin20° sin40° sin80° and then multiply by sin60°.
wait, note that sin60° is √3/2, which is exact.
so perhaps compute the rest multiplied by that.
first, compute q = sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80° = (sin20° sin80°)(sin40° sin60°).
we already computed sin20° sin80° as [0.5 + cos80°] / 2.
similarly, sin40° sin60° = [ cos(40° - 60°) - cos(40° + 60°) ] / 2 = [ cos(-20°) - cos100° ] / 2 = [ cos20° + cos80° ] / 2.
so p = ( [0.5 + cos80°]/2 ) * ( [cos20° + cos80°]/2 )
which is [ (0.5 + cos80°)(cos20° + cos80°) ] / 4.
let's expand this:
multiply 0.5 by cos20°: 0.5 cos20°
multiply 0.5 by cos80°: 0.5 cos80°
multiply cos80° by cos20°: cos80° cos20°
multiply cos80° by cos80°: cos280°
so total expression: 0.5 cos20° + 0.5 cos80° + cos80° cos20° + cos280° all over 4.
so p = [0.5 cos20° + 0.5 cos80° + cos80° cos20° + cos280° ] / 4.
now, perhaps express cos80° cos20° using product-to-sum formula again.
as before, cos80° cos20° = [ cos(100°) + cos(60°) ] / 2 = [ -cos80° + 0.5 ] / 2.
so replace cos80° cos20° with ( -cos80° + 0.5 ) / 2.
then p becomes:
[0.5 cos20° + 0.5 cos80° + ( -cos80° + 0.5 ) / 2 + cos280° ] / 4.
multiply the numerator by 2 to eliminate the denominator:
[ 0.5 cos20° * 2 + 0.5 cos80° * 2 + ( -cos80° + 0.5 ) + cos280° * 2 ] / (4*2 )
wait, maybe better to combine terms:
first, expand the numerator:
0.5 cos20° + 0.5 cos80° + (-cos80° + 0.5)/2 + cos280°
= 0.5 cos20° + 0.5 cos80° - 0.5 cos80° + 0.25 + cos280°
= 0.5 cos20° + (0.5 cos80° - 0.5 cos80°) + 0.25 + cos280°
= 0.5 cos20° + 0.25 + cos280°
therefore, p = [0.5 cos20° + 0.25 + cos280° ] / 4
= (0.5 cos20° + 0.25 + cos280° ) / 4.
hmm, this seems as far as we can take it with product-to-sum formulas.
maybe convert cos280° using a double angle formula.
cos280° = (1 + cos160°)/2.
similarly, cos20° can be written as 2 cos210° - 1.
wait, but let's see:
cos2theta = (1 + cos2theta)/2, so cos280° = (1 + cos160°)/2.
let me substitute that:
p = [0.5*(2 cos210° - 1) + 0.25 + (1 + cos160°)/2 ] / 4.
wait, wait:
wait, cos280° = (1 + cos160°)/2.
so replacing cos280°:
p = [0.5 cos20° + 0.25 + (1 + cos160°)/2 ] / 4.
simplify the numerator:
0.5 cos20° + 0.25 + 0.5 + 0.5 cos160°.
which is 0.5 cos20° + 0.5 cos160° + 0.75.
so p = [0.5 cos20° + 0.5 cos160° + 0.75 ] / 4.
factor out 0.5:
0.5[ cos20° + cos160° ] + 0.75 all over 4.
which is [ 0.5(cos20° + cos160°) + 0.75 ] /4.
which is [ (cos20° + cos160°)/2 + 0.75 ] /4.
let me compute cos20° + cos160°.
using sum-to-product identity:
cos a + cos b = 2 cos[(a+b)/2] cos[(a-b)/2].
so cos20° + cos160° = 2 cos(90°) cos(-70°).
but cos90° = 0, so the whole term becomes zero.
wait, that's interesting.
let me check:
cos160° = cos(180° - 20°) = -cos20°.
so cos20° + cos160° = cos20° - cos20° = 0.
therefore, yes, that term is zero.
therefore, p = [0 + 0.75]/4 = 0.75 /4 = 0.1875 = 3/16.
wait, so p = 3/16.
therefore, the original product is p squared, which is (3/16)^2 = 9/256.
wait, that seems like a nice round number.
let me verify my steps here.
so starting over:
original product: sin20 sin40 sin60 sin80 sin100 sin120 sin140 sin160.
replace sin100 = sin80, sin120 = sin60, sin140 = sin40, sin160 = sin20.
so the product becomes (sin20 sin40 sin60 sin80)^2.
so compute p = sin20 sin40 sin60 sin80.
after multiple steps, using product formulas, reducing products to sums, and using identities, we found that p = 3/16.
therefore, squared it's 9/256.
therefore, the original product is 9/256.
but let me confirm this intermediate step, that p = 3/16.
because if p is 3/16, then the original product is 9/256.
but is p really equal to 3/16?
let me check.
so, when we had:
p = [0.5 cos20 + 0.25 + cos280 ] /4.
then replaced cos280 using the identity, leading to adding cos160 and using the fact that cos20 + cos160 = 0.
therefore, p = (0.75)/4 = 0.1875 = 3/16.
so that seems correct.
therefore, p squared is 9/256.
therefore, the final answer is 9/256.
but just to double-check, let me compute this numerically.
compute the original product: sin20 sin40 sin60 sin80 sin100 sin120 sin140 sin160.
all angles in degrees.
convert them to radians for computation:
but maybe use a calculator.
alternatively, approximate sin20°: 0.3420,
sin40° ≈ 0.6428,
sin60° ≈ 0.8660,
sin80° ≈ 0.9848,
sin100° ≈ 0.9848,
sin120° ≈ 0.8660,
sin140° ≈ 0.6428,
sin160° ≈ 0.3420.
multiply them all:
first, sin20° * sin160° ≈ 0.3420 * 0.3420 ≈ 0.116964
sin40° * sin140° ≈ 0.6428 * 0.6428 ≈ 0.41341984
sin60° * sin120° ≈ 0.8660 * 0.8660 ≈ 0.750676
sin80° * sin100° ≈ 0.9848 * 0.9848 ≈ 0.96973104
now, multiply these four products:
0.11644 * 0.41342 * 0.750676 * 0.969731
compute step by step:
first, 0.11644 * 0.41342 ≈ 0.04809
0.04809 * 0.750676 ≈ 0.03611
0.03611 * 0.969731 ≈ 0.03506
so approximate product is 0.03506.
now, 9/256 ≈ 9 ÷ 256 ≈ 0.03515625.
very close.
so that gives me some confidence that the answer is indeed 9/256.
therefore, the final answer is \boxed{\dfrac{9}{256}}.
**final answer** 
\boxed{\dfrac{9}{256}}

answer: to find the product \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\), we start by recognizing that the angles can be paired using co-function identities and properties of sine functions. 

first, we note that:
\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ, \quad \sin 120^\circ = \sin 60^\circ, \quad \sin 140^\circ = \sin 40^\circ, \quad \sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ
\]
thus, the product can be written as:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2
\]

next, we focus on calculating \(p = \sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ\). using the product-to-sum identities and trigonometric simplifications, we find:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\cos 60^\circ + \cos 100^\circ}{2} = \frac{0.5 - \cos 80^\circ}{2}
\]
\[
\sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ = \frac{\cos 20^\circ + \cos 100^\circ}{2} = \frac{\cos 20^\circ - \cos 80^\circ}{2}
\]

combining these results and simplifying using trigonometric identities, we find that the product \(p\) reduces to:
\[
p = \frac{3}{16}
\]

thus, the original product is:
\[
\left(\frac{3}{16}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{256}
\]

therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\dfrac{9}{256}}
\]
