Okay, let's see. There's a math problem here: Thirty-five students attend a math club meeting. The number of girls is a multiple of 13, and there are more girls than boys. We need to find how many boys are at the meeting.
First, let's break down the information given.
Total students: 35.
Number of girls is a multiple of 13.
Number of girls is greater than the number of boys.
We need to find the number of boys.
Let me think step by step.
Let’s denote the number of girls as G and the number of boys as B.
From the problem, we have:
1. G + B = 35 (since total students are 35)
2. G is a multiple of 13, so G could be 13, 26, 39, etc. But since the total number of students is 35, G has to be less than or equal to 35. So possible values for G are 13, 26.
3. G > B (there are more girls than boys).
So with these three pieces of information, let's proceed.
First, list possible values of G (multiples of 13 less than or equal to 35): 13, 26.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: Determine the number of boys when the number of girls is 13.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: Determine the number of boys when the number of girls is 26.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The number of boys, B, is calculated as the total number of students minus the number of girls, which is 35 - 13, resulting in B = 22.
</Path>
<Path>
2: If the number of girls, G, is 26, the number of boys, B, is calculated as 35 - 26, resulting in B = 9. In this scenario, there are 26 girls and 9 boys, which satisfies the condition G > B.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
When the number of girls is 13, the number of boys is 22. When the number of girls is 26, the number of boys is 9.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So now check which of these possibilities satisfy G > B.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: Determination of the validity of the case where the number of girls is 13.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: Determination of the validity of the case where the number of girls is 26.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The case with 13 girls and 22 boys is examined. The condition G > B is tested by comparing 13 and 22. The result of this comparison is that 13 is less than 22.
The condition G > B is consequently not met.
This specific case is therefore invalid.
</Path>
<Path>
2: For the scenario where the number of girls, G, is 26, the number of boys, B, is 9. This configuration satisfies the condition G > B.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The case with 13 girls and 22 boys is invalid as it fails the condition G > B. The case with 26 girls and 9 boys is valid as it satisfies the condition G > B.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So the only possible solution is G = 26, B = 9.
Let me check again. 26 and 9 sum to 35, yes. 26 is a multiple of 13, and 26 > 9. That's correct. So the answer should be 9.
Wait, but let me see—is there a way G could be 0? But 0 is a multiple of 13 (since 13*0=0), but if G were 0, then B would be 35, but since there are more girls than boys, G can't be 0. But even if G=0, which is a multiple of 13, but G=0 is not greater than B=35, so that's invalid. So possible values for G start from 13 upwards.
Are there other possible multiples of 13? Let's see. 13*1=13, 13*2=26, 13*3=39 which is more than 35, so yes, only 13 and 26. As I considered above.
So as per above, only G=26, B=9 satisfies all conditions.
Alternatively, is there any other possible multiple? Let's check. 13,26,39... no, stops after that. And 13*0=0, but as discussed.
Wait, another point: the problem states "the number of girls at the meeting is a multiple of 13". Since the number of girls has to be a non-negative integer, and a multiple of 13. So possible numbers are 0,13,26,39,... But since the number of girls is more than the number of boys, and total is 35, then total students would require that the number of girls can't be more than 35.
So multiples of 13 up to 35: 13, 26. 0 is a multiple too, but as before, if G=0, then B=35, but G > B is not satisfied. So possible values are 13 and 26 for girls. As we saw, G=13 leads to G < B, which is invalid. G=26 leads to B=9, which is valid.
Wait, just to make sure, is there another multiple of 13 near 35? Let me confirm: 13*1=13, 13*2=26, 13*3=39. 39 is more than 35, so the possible numbers of girls that are multiples of 13 and less than or equal to 35 are 13, 26. So yes, those are the only options. Therefore, the only valid case is G=26, B=9.
Therefore, the number of boys at the meeting is 9.

Answer: Given that there are 35 students in total, the number of girls is a multiple of 13, and there are more girls than boys, we need to find the number of boys.

1. Let \( G \) be the number of girls and \( B \) be the number of boys.
2. We know \( G + B = 35 \).
3. \( G \) must be a multiple of 13. The possible multiples of 13 less than or equal to 35 are 13 and 26.
4. Check each possibility:
   - If \( G = 13 \), then \( B = 35 - 13 = 22 \). However, \( 13 < 22 \), which contradicts the condition that there are more girls than boys.
   - If \( G = 26 \), then \( B = 35 - 26 = 9 \). Here, \( 26 > 9 \), satisfying the condition that there are more girls than boys.

Thus, the only valid solution is \( G = 26 \) and \( B = 9 \).

The final answer is 9.

answer: given that there are 35 students in total, the number of girls is a multiple of 13, and there are more girls than boys, we need to find the number of boys.

1. let \( g \) be the number of girls and \( b \) be the number of boys.
2. we know \( g + b = 35 \).
3. \( g \) must be a multiple of 13. the possible multiples of 13 less than or equal to 35 are 13 and 26.
4. check each possibility:
   - if \( g = 13 \), then \( b = 35 - 13 = 22 \). however, \( 13 < 22 \), which contradicts the condition that there are more girls than boys.
   - if \( g = 26 \), then \( b = 35 - 26 = 9 \). here, \( 26 > 9 \), satisfying the condition that there are more girls than boys.

thus, the only valid solution is \( g = 26 \) and \( b = 9 \).

the final answer is 9
