Okay, so there's this math problem here. Let me read it again: Thirty-five students attend a math club meeting. The number of girls at the meeting is a multiple of 13, and there are more girls than boys attending the meeting. How many boys are at the meeting?
Hmm. Alright, so we know the total number of students is 35. Let's denote the number of girls as G and the number of boys as B. So, the first equation is G + B = 35.
Also, it's given that the number of girls is a multiple of 13. So, G must be equal to 13 multiplied by some integer. Let's call that integer k. So, G = 13k.
Additionally, there are more girls than boys, so G > B.
So, putting this all together, we have: G + B = 35 G = 13k G > B
So, substituting G with 13k in the first equation, we get: 13k + B = 35, which implies B = 35 - 13k.
Also, since G > B, substituting G and B, we have: 13k > 35 - 13k.
Let me write that inequality again: 13k > 35 - 13k.
Adding 13k to both sides: 26k > 35
Divide both sides by 26: k > 35/26
Let me compute 35 divided by 26.
35 divided by 26 is approximately 1.346.
So, k must be greater than approximately 1.346.
Since k is an integer because the number of girls is a multiple of 13, and the number of girls can't be more than 35 because the total students are 35. So, possible values for k are 1, 2, or possibly 3.
Let's check.
If k = 1: G = 13*1 =13, so B=35-13=22. Then G=13, B=22. Is 13>22? No, that's not true.
But the problem says there are more girls than boys. So this case is invalid.
If k=2: G=26. Then B=35-26=9. 26>9? Yes, that satisfies G > B. So this is a possible solution.
If k=3: G=39. 39 is more than 35. That's impossible. So k can't be 3. Hence, the only possible value for k is 2.
Therefore, number of boys is 9.
Let me check again.
Total students: 26 girls +9 boys=35. 26 is a multiple of 13, and 26>9. Yeah, that works.
So the answer should be 9.
**Final Answer** 
the final answer is \boxed{9}

Answer: Given that there are 35 students in total, we need to find the number of boys at the meeting where the number of girls is a multiple of 13 and there are more girls than boys.

1. Let \( G \) be the number of girls and \( B \) be the number of boys. We have the equation:
   \[
   G + B = 35
   \]
2. The number of girls \( G \) is a multiple of 13, so \( G = 13k \) where \( k \) is an integer.
3. Substituting \( G = 13k \) into the total students equation:
   \[
   13k + B = 35 \implies B = 35 - 13k
   \]
4. Since there are more girls than boys, \( G > B \):
   \[
   13k > 35 - 13k
   \]
5. Solving the inequality:
   \[
   13k > 35 - 13k \implies 26k > 35 \implies k > \frac{35}{26} \approx 1.346
   \]
6. \( k \) must be an integer. Possible values for \( k \) are 2 or more. Checking \( k = 2 \):
   \[
   G = 13 \times 2 = 26 \quad \text{and} \quad B = 35 - 26 = 9
   \]
   This satisfies \( 26 > 9 \).

For \( k = 3 \), \( G = 39 \) which exceeds the total number of students, so it is invalid.

Thus, the number of boys at the meeting is \(\boxed{9}\).

answer: given that there are 35 students in total, we need to find the number of boys at the meeting where the number of girls is a multiple of 13 and there are more girls than boys.

1. let \( g \) be the number of girls and \( b \) be the number of boys. we have the equation:
   \[
   g + b = 35
   \]
2. the number of girls \( g \) is a multiple of 13, so \( g = 13k \) where \( k \) is an integer.
3. substituting \( g = 13k \) into the total students equation:
   \[
   13k + b = 35 \implies b = 35 - 13k
   \]
4. since there are more girls than boys, \( g > b \):
   \[
   13k > 35 - 13k
   \]
5. solving the inequality:
   \[
   13k > 35 - 13k \implies 26k > 35 \implies k > \frac{35}{26} \approx 1.346
   \]
6. \( k \) must be an integer. possible values for \( k \) are 2 or more. checking \( k = 2 \):
   \[
   g = 13 \times 2 = 26 \quad \text{and} \quad b = 35 - 26 = 9
   \]
   this satisfies \( 26 > 9 \).

for \( k = 3 \), \( g = 39 \) which exceeds the total number of students, so it is invalid.

thus, the number of boys at the meeting is \(\boxed{9}\)
