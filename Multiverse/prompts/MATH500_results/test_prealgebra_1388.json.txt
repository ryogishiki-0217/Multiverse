Okay, so the problem says: Half the value of 3x - 9 is x + 37. I need to find what x is. Alright, let's break this down step by step. First, translating the problem into math. They say "half the value of 3x - 9", which means (1/2)(3x - 9). That's equal to x + 37. So the equation is: (1/2)(3x - 9) = x + 37. Got that. Now, to solve for x, I need to eliminate the fraction first, maybe. Multiplying both sides by 2 should do that. So, multiplying by 2 cancels out the 1/2 on the left. Let's see: 2 * (1/2)(3x - 9) = 2 * (x + 37). Simplifying left side: (3x - 9). Right side: 2x + 74. So now the equation is 3x - 9 = 2x + 74. Okay, standard linear equation. Next, I want to get all the x terms on one side and the constants on the other. Let's subtract 2x from both sides first. So: 3x - 2x - 9 = 2x - 2x + 74. That simplifies to: x - 9 = 74. Now, add 9 to both sides to move the constant to the right: x - 9 + 9 = 74 + 9. So, x = 83. Wait, let's verify this again. So starting after multiplying both sides by 2, got 3x - 9 = 2x + 74. Then subtract 2x from both sides: (3x - 2x) - 9 = (2x - 2x) + 74). So x - 9 = 74. Then adding 9 to both sides: x = 74 + 9, which is 83. Seems right. Let me check if that's correct by plugging back into original equation. Original equation was (1/2)(3x - 9) = x + 37. Let x = 83. Left side: (1/2)(3*83 - 9) = (1/2)(249 - 9) = (1/2)(240) = 120. Right side: 83 + 37 = 120. Yes, 120 equals 120. Perfect, so x=83 is correct. Just to recap the steps to make sure: 1. Set up the equation (1/2)(3x-9) = x + 37. 2. Eliminated the fraction by multiplying both sides by 2: 3x - 9 = 2x + 74. 3. Subtract 2x from both sides: x - 9 = 74. 4. Add 9 to both sides: x = 83. Plugging back in gives 120 on both sides, so that works. No errors in signs or operations. Another thing, in step 2 when distributing the 2 on the right gives 2x + 74, that's correct. Yes, that seems good. Another way: maybe instead of multiplying by 2 first, you could subtract x from both sides first, but probably complicates with fractions. Let me check. Original equation: (1/2)(3x - 9) = x + 37. Subtract x from both sides: (1/2)(3x - 9) - x = 37. Hmm, then you have (1/2)(3x - 9) - x = 37. Maybe combine terms: let's see, (3x/2 - 9/2) - x = 37. Convert x to 2x/2: 3x/2 - 2x/2 - 9/2 = 37. Simplifies to (x/2 - 9/2) = 37. Multiply both sides by 2: x - 9 = 74. So x = 83. Same answer. Another way to approach, but introducing fractions. Maybe more steps and chances for error. Probably why first method more efficient. But good to check. Either way, answer is 83. Therefore, the value of x is 83. Think
the final answer is 83

Answer: To solve the problem where half the value of \(3x - 9\) is \(x + 37\), we start by setting up the equation:

\[
\frac{1}{2}(3x - 9) = x + 37
\]

First, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:

\[
2 \cdot \frac{1}{2}(3x - 9) = 2 \cdot (x + 37)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
3x - 9 = 2x + 74
\]

Next, we subtract \(2x\) from both sides to isolate the \(x\) terms:

\[
3x - 2x - 9 = 74
\]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[
x - 9 = 74
\]

Finally, adding 9 to both sides gives:

\[
x = 83
\]

To verify, we substitute \(x = 83\) back into the original equation:

- Left side: \(\frac{1}{2}(3 \cdot 83 - 9) = \frac{1}{2}(249 - 9) = \frac{1}{2}(240) = 120\)
- Right side: \(83 + 37 = 120\)

Both sides are equal, confirming our solution is correct.

Thus, the value of \(x\) is \(\boxed{83}\).

the final answer is 83

answer: to solve the problem where half the value of \(3x - 9\) is \(x + 37\), we start by setting up the equation:

\[
\frac{1}{2}(3x - 9) = x + 37
\]

first, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:

\[
2 \cdot \frac{1}{2}(3x - 9) = 2 \cdot (x + 37)
\]

this simplifies to:

\[
3x - 9 = 2x + 74
\]

next, we subtract \(2x\) from both sides to isolate the \(x\) terms:

\[
3x - 2x - 9 = 74
\]

simplifying this, we get:

\[
x - 9 = 74
\]

finally, adding 9 to both sides gives:

\[
x = 83
\]

to verify, we substitute \(x = 83\) back into the original equation:

- left side: \(\frac{1}{2}(3 \cdot 83 - 9) = \frac{1}{2}(249 - 9) = \frac{1}{2}(240) = 120\)
- right side: \(83 + 37 = 120\)

both sides are equal, confirming our solution is correct.

thus, the value of \(x\) is \(\boxed{83}\).

the final answer is 83
