Okay, so I have this equation here: the square root of (3x - 5) equals 2.
I need to solve for x.
Hmm, let me think.
Alright, square roots.
To get rid of the square root, I remember that I need to square both sides of the equation.
That should do it, right?
Because (sqrt(a))^2 is a, and 2^2 is 4.
Let me write that down.
Let's see: if I have sqrt(3x - 5) = 2, then squaring both sides gives me [sqrt(3x - 5)]2 = (2)2, which simplifies to 3x - 5 = 4.
Now the square root is gone, that's good.
Then I can solve for x as a regular linear equation.
Let's think in parallel.

1: Adding 5 to both sides of the equation 3x - 5 = 4 results in 3x = 9.

<Path>
2: The equation 3x - 5 = 4 is solved by adding 5 to the left side and 5 to the right side, resulting in 3x = 9.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
Both methods of adding 5 to both sides of the equation 3x - 5 = 4 lead to the simplified equation 3x = 9.
</Conclusion>

Then divide both sides by 3, giving me x = 3.
Wait, but I should check if this is a valid solution because sometimes when you square both sides of an equation, especially with square roots, you can introduce extraneous solutions.

1: The verification of x=3 as a solution to the original equation sqrt(3x-5)=2.

1: The value x=3 is substituted by substituting it into the original equation sqrt(3x-5)=2. The left side becomes sqrt(3*3 - 5), which simplifies to sqrt(9 - 5) or sqrt(4), equaling 2. The right side of the equation is 2. Since both sides are equal, x=3 is confirmed as a valid solution.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The value x=-1 is checked in the original equation sqrt(3x-5)=2. Substituting x=-1 into the left side gives sqrt(3*(-1) - 5), which simplifies to sqrt(3 + 3 - 5) or sqrt(1). This evaluates to 1, which is not equal to 2. Consequently, x=-1 a valid solution.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The verification process demonstrates that x=3 is a valid solution to the original equation sqrt(3x-5)=2, whereas x=-1 is not.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So x=3 is the correct solution.
Just to make sure, let me go through the steps again.
Original equation: sqrt(3x -5 ) =2.
Square both sides: 3x -5 =4.
Add 5: 3x=9.
Divide by 3: x=3.
Check: sqrt(3*(3) -5)=sqrt(9 -5)=sqrt(4)=2, which matches the right side.
Perfect, that works.
So the answer is x=3.
But wait, the problem says "find all possible values of x".
Since after solving we got x=3 and it checks out, that's the only solution.
Let me confirm that there aren't any other solutions.
Because when we squared both sides, sometimes that can create extraneous solutions, but in this case, the other thing to consider is that the expression under the square root, 3x -5, must be non-negative because the square root of a real number is defined to be non-negative.
So sqrt(a) is defined when a >=0.
So in this case, 3x -5 must be greater or equal to zero.
Let's see: 3x -5 >=0 => 3x >=5 => x >= 5/3.
So x=3 is in that domain, so that's good.
If the solution were, say, x=1, then 3*1 -5 = -2, which is negative, and that wouldn't be in the domain.
So since 3x -5 has to be non-negative, x must be greater or equal to 5/3.
Therefore, our solution x=3 is within that domain, so it's valid.
Therefore, the only possible value of x is 3.
No other solutions exist.
Yes, I think that's it.
Let me also consider if there could be another solution if we thought about the square root giving a negative result, but by definition, the principal square root is non-negative, so that's not the case here.
Therefore, x=3 is the only possible solution.
the final answer is 3

Answer: To solve the equation \(\sqrt{3x - 5} = 2\), we start by squaring both sides to eliminate the square root:

\[
(\sqrt{3x - 5})^2 = 2^2
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
3x - 5 = 4
\]

Next, we solve for \(x\) by isolating the variable. First, add 5 to both sides:

\[
3x = 9
\]

Then, divide both sides by 3:

\[
x = 3
\]

To ensure the solution is valid, we check it in the original equation. Substituting \(x = 3\) into \(\sqrt{3x - 5}\):

\[
\sqrt{3(3) - 5} = \sqrt{9 - 5} = \sqrt{4} = 2
\]

The left side equals the right side, confirming \(x = 3\) is a valid solution. Additionally, we verify that \(3x - 5 \geq 0\):

\[
3(3) - 5 = 9 - 5 = 4 \geq 0
\]

Thus, \(x = 3\) is within the domain. Therefore, the only possible value of \(x\) is \(\boxed{3}\).

the final answer is 3
