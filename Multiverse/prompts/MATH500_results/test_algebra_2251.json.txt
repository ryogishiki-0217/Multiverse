Okay, so I have this equation here: the square root of (3x - 5) equals 2. I need to solve for x. Hmm, let me remember how to handle square roots in equations. First thing that comes to mind is that I should square both sides to eliminate the square root. Yeah, that’s a common technique. Let me write that down.

Wait, but hold on. Is there any restriction on the domain here because of the square root? Square roots require the radicand (that’s the stuff inside the square root) to be non-negative. Let's check the original equation: sqrt(3x - 5) is defined when 3x - 5 ≥ 0. Solving that, 3x ≥ 5 → x ≥ 5/3. So, x must be at least 5/3. In this case, when we solved, we got x = 3, which is greater than 5/3, so it's within the domain. Therefore, it's a valid solution. But what if when we square both sides, sometimes extraneous solutions can be introduced, right? So even if we start with a value within the domain, squaring could lead to solutions that aren't valid in the original equation. But in this case, let me check. We squared both sides and got x = 3. Plugging back into the original equation: sqrt(3*3 -5) = sqrt(9 -5) = sqrt(4) = 2, which is equal to the right-hand side. So, no extraneous solution here. So x = 3 is the only solution. Therefore, the answer should be x = 3.

Therefore, x=3 is the only possible value. Wait, the problem says "find all possible values of x". So just to be thorough, let me check if there are any other possible solutions. Suppose someone thinks that when you square both sides, you might get an equation that introduces another solution. For example, if you have sqrt(expression) = a, then after squaring, expression = a2, but the original equation could have a negative solution which would not be valid because square root itself is non-negative. But in this case, when we solved, we only get x=3. Alternatively, if we think about absolute values. Wait, no, when you square both sides, the equation 3x-5 = 4 is just a regular equation. So solving 3x - 5 = 4 leads to 3x = 9; x=3. There's only one solution here. So even if we think about it as sqrt(3x -5) = 2, which means that 3x -5 must equal 4, but 4 is positive, so even considering that squaring can introduce both positive and negative roots, the original equation had sqrt(3x -5) = 2, which is positive 2. Because the square root function doesn’t yield negative unless complex, but assuming we’re in real numbers here. So in real numbers, sqrt(...) is defined as the non-negative root. So when we square both sides, we don’t introduce a negative counterpart. Therefore, the equation 3x -5 = 4 is the correct one to solve, and x=3 is the only solution. Therefore, the final answer is x=3. Wait, but just to make sure, let me verify once again. Original equation: sqrt(3x -5) =2. Square both sides: 3x -5 =4. Solve: 3x=9 =>x=3. Check the solution: sqrt(3*3 -5) =sqrt(9-5)=sqrt(4)=2. Correct. And since 3x-5 must be non-negative, x must be ≥5/3, so our solution is in the valid domain. Therefore, no extraneous solutions. Therefore, the only possible value of x is 3.

Answer: To solve the equation \(\sqrt{3x - 5} = 2\), we start by squaring both sides to eliminate the square root:

\[
(\sqrt{3x - 5})^2 = 2^2
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
3x - 5 = 4
\]

Next, we solve for \(x\) by isolating the variable. First, add 5 to both sides:

\[
3x = 9
\]

Then, divide both sides by 3:

\[
x = 3
\]

We must verify that this solution is valid within the original equation's domain. The expression inside the square root, \(3x - 5\), must be non-negative. Substituting \(x = 3\):

\[
3(3) - 5 = 9 - 5 = 4 \geq 0
\]

Since 4 is non-negative, \(x = 3\) is within the domain. Checking the solution in the original equation:

\[
\sqrt{3(3) - 5} = \sqrt{4} = 2
\]

The left side equals the right side, confirming \(x = 3\) is correct. There are no extraneous solutions as squaring both sides did not introduce any invalid solutions.

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{3}\).

\[
(\sqrt{3x - 5})^2 = 2^2
\]

this simplifies to:

\[
3x = 9
\]

then, divide both sides by 3:

\[
x = 3

we must verify that this solution is valid within the original equation's domain. the expression inside the square root, \(3x - 5\), must be non-negative. substituting \(x = 3\):

\[
3(3) - 5 = 9 - 5 = 4 \geq 0
\]

since 4 is non-negative, \(x = 3\) is within the domain. checking the solution in the original equation:

\[
\sqrt{3(3) - 5} = \sqrt{4} = 2
\]

the left side equals the right side, confirming \(x = 3\) is correct. there are no extraneous solutions as squaring both sides did not introduce any invalid solutions.

thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{3}\)
