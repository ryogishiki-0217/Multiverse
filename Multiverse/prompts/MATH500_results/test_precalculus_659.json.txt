Okay, so I need to find the equation of the plane that contains the points (0, -1, -1), (-4, 4, 4), and (4, 5, 1).
The answer should be in the form Ax + By + Cz + D = 0, with the coefficients being integers.
Also, A has to be positive, and the greatest common divisor of the absolute values of the coefficients should be 1.
Alright, let's start by recalling how to find the equation of a plane given three points.
First, I remember that to define a plane in 3D space, we need a point on the plane and a normal vector.
Since all three points lie on the plane, we can use any one of them and find the normal vector.
But how do we find the normal vector?
Oh right, the normal vector can be found by taking the cross product of two vectors that lie on the plane.
So, if I can create two vectors using the given points, their cross product will give me the normal vector.
Let me choose two vectors.
Let's pick the first point as (0, -1, -1).
Let's call this point P.
Then, take the other two points, Q = (-4, 4, 4) and R = (4, 5, 1).
If I find vectors PQ and PR, then the cross product of PQ and PR will give me the normal vector.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: The vector PQ from point P to point Q.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: The vector PR from point P to point R.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The vector PQ is determined by subtracting the coordinates of point P from point Q, resulting in (-4 - 0, 4 - (-1), 4 - (-1)), which simplifies to (-4, 5, 5).
</Path>
<Path>
2: The vector PR is calculated from point P (0, -1, -1) to point R (4, 5, 1). The components of PR are (4 - 0, 5 - (-1), 1 - (-1)), which simplifies to (4, 6, 2).
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The vector PQ is (-4, 5, 5) and the vector PR is (4, 6, 2).
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Now, the cross product of PQ and PR will give a vector that is normal to the plane.
The cross product of two vectors (a1, a2, a3) and (b1, b2, b3) is given by the determinant:
|i    j    k |
|a1  a2   a3|
|b1  b2   b3|
Which results in:
(ai(a2b3 - a3b2) - j(a1b3 - a3b1) + k(a1b2 - a2b1))
But maybe it's easier to use the component formula.
So, let's denote PQ = (-4, 5, 5) and PR = (4, 6, 2).
The cross product PQ × PR is:
i*(5*2 - 5*6) - j*(-4*2 - 5*4) + k*(-4*6 - 5*4)
Let's compute each component step by step.
First, the i-component: (5*2 - 5*6) = (10 - 30) = -20
Then, the j-component: Since there's a negative sign before j, let's compute ( - (-4*2 - 5*4)).
First calculate -4*2 - 5*4 = -8 -20 = -28.
Then multiply by -1 (because of the -j): -(-28) = 28.
Wait, actually, the cross product formula is:
For the i component, (a2b3 - a3b2),
for the j component, -(a1b3 - a3b1),
for the k component, (a1b2 - a2b1).
So cross product is:
(-20, 28, -44)
Wait, let me check:
Wait, cross product:
i*(5*2 - 5*6) - j*(-4*2 - 5*4) + k*(-4*6 - 5*4)
Compute each term:
i*(10 - 30) = i*(-20)
- j*(-8 -20) = - j*(-28) = 28j
k*( -24 -20) = k*(-44)
So the cross product is (-20, 28, -44).
So the normal vector to the plane is (-20, 28, -44).
But the coefficients A, B, C in the plane equation are the components of the normal vector.
However, we need A to be positive, so maybe we can take the opposite of this vector?
Which would be (20, -28, 44).
But we also need to make sure that the gcd of the coefficients is 1.
Let's check if 20, -28, 44 can be reduced.
All these numbers are divisible by 4.
20/4=5, 28/4=7, 44/4=11.
So dividing by 4 gives (5, -7, 11).
Then we have to check if 5, -7, 11 have a common divisor.
Since 5 is prime, and 7 and 11 are primes, their gcd is 1.
So the normal vector can be (5, -7, 11).
But we need the fourth coefficient D as well, such that the equation is 5x -7y +11z + D = 0.
To find D, we substitute one of the points into the equation.
Let's use the point (0, -1, -1).
Substituting into the equation:
5*0 -7*(-1) +11*(-1) + D = 0
Compute:
0 +7 -11 + D = 0
(7 -11) + D = 0
-4 + D = 0
So D = 4
Therefore, the equation is 5x -7y +11z +4 = 0.
But before finalizing, let's check if the gcd of |5|, |-7|, |11|, |4| is 1.
The numbers 5,7,11 are primes, and 4 is 22.
The common divisors are 1.
So gcd(5,7,11,4)=1.
Hence, this satisfies the conditions.
Let me verify by checking the other two points.
Let's think in parallel.

<Path>
1: The plane equation 5x - 7y + 11z + 4 = 0 is tested with point Q = (-4, 4, 4). The left-hand side calculation is 5*(-4) - 7*4 + 11*4 + 4, which simplifies to -20 - 28 + 44 + 4, resulting in 0. This confirms the equation holds true for point Q.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The derived plane equation 5x - 7y + 1z + 4 = 0 is verified using point R = (4, 5, 1). Substituting x = 4, y = 5, and z = 1 into the equation yields 5(4) - 7(5) + 11(1) + 4, which simplifies to 20 - 35 + 11 + 4. The intermediate sum 20 - 35 is -15. Adding 11 to -15 gives 16. The final sum of 16 + 4 is 0.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The derived plane equation 5x - 7y + 11z + 4 = 0 satisfies the condition for point Q = (-4, 4, 4) as the left-hand side equals 0, and it also satisfies the condition for point R = (4, 5, 1) as the left-hand side equals 0.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
All right, both points satisfy the equation.
So it seems correct.
Therefore, the equation is 5x -7y +11z +4 =0.
The problem says to write it in the form Ax + By + Cz + D =0, where A>0 and gcd is 1, which is satisfied here.
So the coefficients are A=5, B=-7, C=11, D=4.
Wait, but in the equation, D is the constant term.
So in the final answer, it's written as "Ax + By + Cz + D = 0", so D is the constant term.
In our case, D is 4, which is correct.
So, the final answer should be 5x -7y +11z +4 =0.
Wait, but let me check once again if there was a calculation error.
Starting with the cross product.
PQ = (-4, 5, 5)
PR = (4, 6, 2)
Cross product:
i*(5*2 - 5*6) - j*(-4*2 - 5*4) + k*(-4*6 -5*4)
So:
i*(10 -30) -j*(-8 -20) +k*(-24 -20)
= i*(-20) -j*(-28) +k*(-44)
So, -20i +28j -44k
So the normal vector is (-20,28,-44).
Then we took the opposite to make it positive, so (20, -28, 44).
Then divided by 4 to simplify: 20/4=5, -28/4=-7, 44/4=11.
So (5, -7, 11).
Then using point (0,-1,-1):
5*0 -7*(-1) +11*(-1) + D =0
0 +7 -11 + D =0
-4 + D =0
D=4.
Correct.
All the steps seem right.
So, the equation is 5x -7y +11z +4=0.
Let's think in parallel.

The derived equation 5x - 7y + 11z + 4 = 0 satisfies the specified conditions: it is in the required form, the coefficients are integers, gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|) = 1, and A > 0.

Therefore, I can conclude that.
**Final Answer** 
\boxed{5x - 7y + 11z + 4 = 0}
</Think>

Answer: To find the equation of the plane containing the points \((0, -1, -1)\), \((-4, 4, 4)\), and \((4, 5, 1)\), we start by determining two vectors in the plane. 

1. Vector \(\overrightarrow{PQ}\) from point \(P(0, -1, -1)\) to \(Q(-4, 4, 4)\):
   \[
   \overrightarrow{PQ} = (-4 - 0, 4 + 1, 4 + 1) = (-4, 5, 5)
   \]

2. Vector \(\overrightarrow{PR}\) from point \(P(0, -1, -1)\) to \(R(4, 5, 1)\):
   \[
   \overrightarrow{PR} = (4 - 0, 5 + 1, 1 + 1) = (4, 6, 2)
   \]

Next, we find the normal vector to the plane by taking the cross product of \(\overrightarrow{PQ}\) and \(\overrightarrow{PR}\):
\[
\overrightarrow{PQ} \times \overrightarrow{PR} = \begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
-4 & 5 & 5 \\
4 & 6 & 2
\end{vmatrix}
\]
\[
= \mathbf{i}(5 \cdot 2 - 5 \cdot 6) - \mathbf{j}(-4 \cdot 2 - 5 \cdot 4) + \mathbf{k}(-4 \cdot 6 - 5 \cdot 4)
\]
\[
= \mathbf{i}(10 - 30) - \mathbf{j}(-8 - 20) + \mathbf{k}(-24 - 20)
\]
\[
= -20\mathbf{i} + 28\mathbf{j} - 44\mathbf{k}
\]
\[
= (-20, 28, -44)
\]

We simplify the normal vector by dividing by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the components. The GCD of 20, 28, and 44 is 4, so we divide by 4:
\[
(-20/4, 28/4, -44/4) = (-5, 7, -11)
\]

To ensure \(A > 0\), we take the opposite vector:
\[
(5, -7, 11)
\]

Using point \(P(0, -1, -1)\) to find \(D\):
\[
5(0) - 7(-1) + 11(-1) + D = 0
\]
\[
0 + 7 - 11 + D = 0
\]
\[
-4 + D = 0 \implies D = 4
\]

The equation of the plane is:
\[
5x - 7y + 11z + 4 = 0
\]

Verifying with points \(Q\) and \(R\) confirms the equation is correct. The coefficients \(5, -7, 11, 4\) have a GCD of 1, satisfying all conditions.

The final answer is \(\boxed{5x - 7y + 11z + 4 = 0}\).

let's pick the first point as (0, -1, -1).
let's call this point p.
then, take the other two points, q = (-4, 4, 4) and r = (4, 5, 1).
if i find vectors pq and pr, then the cross product of pq and pr will give me the normal vector.
let's think in parallel.

</path>
<conclusion>
the vector pq is (-4, 5, 5) and the vector pr is (4, 6, 2).
</conclusion>
</parallel>
now, the cross product of pq and pr will give a vector that is normal to the plane.
the cross product of two vectors (a1, a2, a3) and (b1, b2, b3) is given by the determinant:
|i    j    k |
|a1  a2   a3|
|b1  b2   b3|
which results in:
(ai(a2b3 - a3b2) - j(a1b3 - a3b1) + k(a1b2 - a2b1))
but maybe it's easier to use the component formula.
so, let's denote pq = (-4, 5, 5) and pr = (4, 6, 2).
the cross product pq × pr is:
i*(5*2 - 5*6) - j*(-4*2 - 5*4) + k*(-4*6 - 5*4)
let's compute each component step by step.
first, the i-component: (5*2 - 5*6) = (10 - 30) = -20
then, the j-component: since there's a negative sign before j, let's compute ( - (-4*2 - 5*4)).
first calculate -4*2 - 5*4 = -8 -20 = -28.
then multiply by -1 (because of the -j): -(-28) = 28.
wait, actually, the cross product formula is:
for the i component, (a2b3 - a3b2),
for the j component, -(a1b3 - a3b1),
for the k component, (a1b2 - a2b1).
so cross product is:
(-20, 28, -44)
wait, let me check:
wait, cross product:
i*(5*2 - 5*6) - j*(-4*2 - 5*4) + k*(-4*6 - 5*4)
compute each term:
i*(10 - 30) = i*(-20)
- j*(-8 -20) = - j*(-28) = 28j
k*( -24 -20) = k*(-44)
so the cross product is (-20, 28, -44).
so the normal vector to the plane is (-20, 28, -44).
but the coefficients a, b, c in the plane equation are the components of the normal vector.
however, we need a to be positive, so maybe we can take the opposite of this vector?
which would be (20, -28, 44).
but we also need to make sure that the gcd of the coefficients is 1.
let's check if 20, -28, 44 can be reduced.
all these numbers are divisible by 4.
20/4=5, 28/4=7, 44/4=11.
so dividing by 4 gives (5, -7, 11).
then we have to check if 5, -7, 11 have a common divisor.
since 5 is prime, and 7 and 11 are primes, their gcd is 1.
so the normal vector can be (5, -7, 11).
but we need the fourth coefficient d as well, such that the equation is 5x -7y +11z + d = 0.
to find d, we substitute one of the points into the equation.
let's use the point (0, -1, -1).
substituting into the equation:
5*0 -7*(-1) +11*(-1) + d = 0
compute:
0 +7 -11 + d = 0
(7 -11) + d = 0
-4 + d = 0
so d = 4
therefore, the equation is 5x -7y +11z +4 = 0.
but before finalizing, let's check if the gcd of |5|, |-7|, |11|, |4| is 1.
the numbers 5,7,11 are primes, and 4 is 22.
the common divisors are 1.
so gcd(5,7,11,4)=1.
hence, this satisfies the conditions.
let me verify by checking the other two points.
let's think in parallel.

so the coefficients are a=5, b=-7, c=11, d=4.
wait, but in the equation, d is the constant term.
so in the final answer, it's written as "ax + by + cz + d = 0", so d is the constant term.
in our case, d is 4, which is correct.
so, the final answer should be 5x -7y +11z +4 =0.
wait, but let me check once again if there was a calculation error.
starting with the cross product.
pq = (-4, 5, 5)
pr = (4, 6, 2)
cross product:
i*(5*2 - 5*6) - j*(-4*2 - 5*4) + k*(-4*6 -5*4)
so:
i*(10 -30) -j*(-8 -20) +k*(-24 -20)
= i*(-20) -j*(-28) +k*(-44)
so, -20i +28j -44k
so the normal vector is (-20,28,-44).
then we took the opposite to make it positive, so (20, -28, 44).
then divided by 4 to simplify: 20/4=5, -28/4=-7, 44/4=11.
so (5, -7, 11).
then using point (0,-1,-1):
5*0 -7*(-1) +11*(-1) + d =0
0 +7 -11 + d =0
-4 + d =0
d=4.
correct.

**final answer** 
\boxed{5x - 7y + 11z + 4 = 0}
</think>

answer: to find the equation of the plane containing the points \((0, -1, -1)\), \((-4, 4, 4)\), and \((4, 5, 1)\), we start by determining two vectors in the plane. 

1. vector \(\overrightarrow{pq}\) from point \(p(0, -1, -1)\) to \(q(-4, 4, 4)\):
   \[
   \overrightarrow{pq} = (-4 - 0, 4 + 1, 4 + 1) = (-4, 5, 5)
   \]

2. vector \(\overrightarrow{pr}\) from point \(p(0, -1, -1)\) to \(r(4, 5, 1)\):
   \[
   \overrightarrow{pr} = (4 - 0, 5 + 1, 1 + 1) = (4, 6, 2)
   \]

next, we find the normal vector to the plane by taking the cross product of \(\overrightarrow{pq}\) and \(\overrightarrow{pr}\):
\[
\overrightarrow{pq} \times \overrightarrow{pr} = \begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
-4 & 5 & 5 \\
4 & 6 & 2
\end{vmatrix}
\]
\[
= \mathbf{i}(5 \cdot 2 - 5 \cdot 6) - \mathbf{j}(-4 \cdot 2 - 5 \cdot 4) + \mathbf{k}(-4 \cdot 6 - 5 \cdot 4)
\]
\[
= \mathbf{i}(10 - 30) - \mathbf{j}(-8 - 20) + \mathbf{k}(-24 - 20)
\]
\[
= -20\mathbf{i} + 28\mathbf{j} - 44\mathbf{k}
\]
\[
= (-20, 28, -44)
\]

we simplify the normal vector by dividing by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the components. the gcd of 20, 28, and 44 is 4, so we divide by 4:
\[
(-20/4, 28/4, -44/4) = (-5, 7, -11)
\]

to ensure \(a > 0\), we take the opposite vector:
\[
(5, -7, 11)
\]

using point \(p(0, -1, -1)\) to find \(d\):
\[
5(0) - 7(-1) + 11(-1) + d = 0
\]
\[
0 + 7 - 11 + d = 0
\]
\[
-4 + d = 0 \implies d = 4
\]

the equation of the plane is:
\[
5x - 7y + 11z + 4 = 0
\]
