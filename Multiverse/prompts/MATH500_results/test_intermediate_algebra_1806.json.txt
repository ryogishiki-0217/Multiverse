Okay, so I need to find the maximum value of |1 + z| + |1 - z + z2| given that |z| = 1.
Hmm, complex numbers with modulus conditions.
I remember that when dealing with complex numbers on the unit circle, it can be useful to represent them in their polar form.
So maybe I can let z = e^(iθ), where θ is the angle from 0 to 2π.
That might help me visualize the problem.
Let me write that down: z = cosθ + i sinθ.
Then, I can substitute this into the expressions |1 + z| and |1 - z + z2| and try to compute them.
Let's think in parallel.

1: First, let's handle |1 + z|.
If z = e^(iθ), then 1 + z is 1 + cosθ + i sinθ.
The modulus of this is sqrt{(1 + cosθ)^2 + (sinθ)^2}.
Let's compute that:
sqrt[(1 + cosθ)^2 + sin2θ] = sqrt[1 + 2cosθ + cos2θ + sin2θ]
Simplify using the Pythagorean identity: sin2θ + cos2θ = 1.
So that becomes sqrt[1 + 2cosθ + 1] = sqrt[2 + 2cosθ].
That simplifies further to sqrt[2(1 + cosθ)].
And if I recall, 1 + cosθ is 2 cos2(θ/2), from the half-angle formula.
So sqrt[4 cos2(θ/2)] = 2 |cos(θ/2)|.
But since θ can be any angle, cos(θ/2) can be positive or negative, but the modulus would make it absolute.
Therefore, |1 + z| = 2 |cos(θ/2)|.
Hmm, but wait, is that the case?
Wait, actually, wait: Wait, 1 + z is 1 + cosθ + i sinθ.
Let me compute modulus: sqrt{(1 + cosθ)^2 + (sinθ)^2} = sqrt{1 + 2cosθ + cos2θ + sin2θ} = sqrt{2 + 2cosθ}.
So that's correct.
Then sqrt{2 + 2cosθ} = 2 |cos(θ/2)|, right?
Because 2 + 2cosθ = 2(1 + cosθ) = 2 * 2cos2(θ/2) = 4 cos2(θ/2 ).
Therefore sqrt{4 cos2(θ/2)} = 2 |cos(θ/2) |.
So yes, |1 + z| = 2 |cos(θ/2)|.
Okay, got that.
</Path>
<Path>
2: Similarly, the second term |1 - z + z2|.
Let me compute 1 - z + z2 first.
Let's substitute z = e^(iθ):
1 - e^(iθ) + e^(i2θ)
Again, breaking into real and imaginary parts.
Real part: 1 - cosθ + cos(2θ)
Imaginary part: -sinθ + sin(2θ)
So the modulus squared would be [1 - cosθ + cos(2θ)]2 + [-sinθ + sin(2θ)]2.
Let me compute that.
First, expand [1 - cosθ + cos(2θ)]2:
= (1 - cosθ)^2 + 2(1 - cosθ)cos(2θ) + cos2(2θ)
= 1 - 2cosθ + cos2θ + 2cos(2θ) - 2cosθ cos(2θ) + cos2(2θ)
Similarly, expand [-sinθ + sin(2θ)]2:
= sin2θ - 2sinθ sin(2θ) + sin2(2θ)
= sin2θ - 2sinθ sin(2θ) + sin2(2θ)
Let me double-check.
Wait, hang on, actually:
Wait, [ - sinθ + sin(2θ) ]2 = sin2θ - 2 sinθ sin(2θ) + sin2(2θ).
Yes, that's right.
So putting it all together, modulus squared is:
[1 - cosθ + cos(2θ)]2 + [ - sinθ + sin(2θ) ]2
= (1 - cosθ + cos(2θ))^2 + ( - sinθ + sin(2θ) )^2
Let me compute this step by step.
First, expand each bracket:
For the real parts:
1 - 2cosθ + cos2θ + 2cos(2θ) (from the -2cosθ*cos(2θ) term)
Wait, maybe expanding correctly:
Wait, (a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc.
So let's think:
Let me denote:
A = 1 - cosθ, B = cos(2θ).
So (A + B)^2 = A^2 + 2AB + B^2.
So:
A^2 = (1 - cosθ)^2 = 1 - 2cosθ + cos2θ
2AB = 2*(1 - cosθ)*cos(2θ) = 2*cos(2θ) - 2*cosθ*cos(2θ)
B^2 = cos2(2θ)
Similarly, the imaginary part:
(- sinθ + sin(2θ) )^2
= (-sinθ)^2 + 2*(-sinθ)*(sin(2θ)) + (sin(2θ))^2
= sin2θ - 2 sinθ sin(2θ) + sin2(2θ)
So adding the real part squared and imaginary part squared gives total modulus squared.
So combining the two:
Modulus squared of the second term is:
[1 - cosθ]^2 + 2*(1 - cosθ)*cos(2θ) + cos2(2θ) + sin2θ - 2 sinθ sin(2θ) + sin2(2θ)
Wait, let me group terms:
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: Simplify the expression for the modulus squared of the second term by grouping and combining like terms.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: Simplify the remaining part of the expression for the modulus squared of the second term by grouping and combining like terms.

</Goal>
<Path>
1: The terms [1 - cosθ]^2 and sin2θ are combined. The term [1 - cosθ]^2 expands to 1 - 2cosθ + cos2θ. The sum of 1 - 2cosθ + cos2θ and sin2θ is 1 - 2cosθ + (cos2θ + sin2θ), which simplifies to 1 - 2cosθ + 1, resulting in 2 - 2cosθ.
The expression for the modulus squared is now 2 - 2cosθ plus the remaining terms.
The remaining terms are 2*(1 - cosθ)*cos(2θ), cos2(2θ), -2 sinθ sin(2θ), and sin2(2θ).
</Path>
<Path>
2: The remaining terms are -2 sinθ sin(2θ) and cos2(2θ) + sin2(2θ). The term cos2(2θ) + sin2(2θ) simplifies to 1. The expression therefore becomes 3 - 2cosθ - 2cosθ cos(2θ) - 2sinθ sin(2θ).
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The modulus squared of the second term simplifies to 2 - 2cosθ + 2*(1 - cosθ)*cos(2θ) - 2 sinθ sin(2θ).
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Wait, let's see:
Wait, perhaps we can use some trigonometric identities here.
Let me recall that cos(2θ) = 2cos2θ - 1 = 1 - 2sin2θ, and sin(2θ) = 2sinθ cosθ.
So maybe express everything in terms of cosθ and sinθ.
Let me try to substitute cos(2θ) and sin(2θ):
So, the term -2 sinθ sin(2θ) becomes -2 sinθ*(2 sinθ cosθ ) = -4 sin2θ cosθ
Similarly, -2 cosθ cos(2θ) becomes -2 cosθ*(2 cos2θ - 1) = -4 cos3θ + 2 cosθ
Therefore, substituting back:
So the modulus squared becomes:
2 - 2cosθ + 2*(1 - cosθ)*(2cos2θ -1 ) -4 sin2θ cosθ
Wait, let me double-check:
Wait, the term 2*(1 - cosθ)*cos(2θ):
cos(2θ) = 2cos2θ -1, so:
2*(1 - cosθ)*(2cos2θ -1 )
Similarly, -2 sinθ sin(2θ) becomes -4 sin2θ cosθ as above.
So expanding 2*(1 - cosθ)*(2cos2θ -1 ):
First, expand (1 - cosθ)(2cos2θ -1 ):
Multiply 1*(2cos2θ -1 ) = 2cos2θ -1
Multiply -cosθ*(2cos2θ -1 ) = -2cos3θ + cosθ
So total: 2cos2θ -1 -2cos3θ + cosθ
Multiply by 2: 4cos2θ -2 -4cos3θ + 2cosθ
Therefore, modulus squared is:
2 - 2cosθ + 4cos2θ -2 -4cos3θ + 2cosθ -4 sin2θ cosθ
Simplify terms:
2 -2 cancels out.
-2cosθ +2cosθ cancels.
So remaining terms: 4cos2θ -4cos3θ -4 sin2θ cosθ
Factor out -4 cosθ:
-4 cosθ( cos2θ - cosθ + sin2θ )
Hmm.
Inside the bracket: cos2θ - cosθ + sin2θ
But cos2θ + sin2θ = 1, so that becomes 1 - cosθ
Therefore, modulus squared is -4 cosθ (1 - cosθ )
Wait, so:
-4 cosθ (1 - cosθ ) = -4 cosθ + 4 cos2θ
So modulus squared is 4 cos2θ -4 cosθ
But wait, let's verify that step again:
Original modulus squared after expansion:
2 -2cosθ +4cos2θ -4cos3θ -4 sin2θ cosθ
But then when factoring, I grouped the last three terms?
Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake there.
Let me check again.
Wait, starting from:
4cos2θ -4cos3θ -4 sin2θ cosθ
Factor out -4 cosθ:
First term: 4cos2θ = -4 cosθ*(-cosθ)
Second term: -4 cos3θ = -4 cosθ*(cos2θ )
Third term: -4 sin2θ cosθ = -4 cosθ* sin2θ
Therefore, factor out -4 cosθ:
-4 cosθ( -cosθ + cos2θ + sin2θ )
Simplify inside the bracket:
-cosθ + cos2θ + sin2θ = (-cosθ) + (cos2θ + sin2θ ) = (-cosθ) +1 = 1 - cosθ
Therefore, modulus squared is -4 cosθ*(1 - cosθ )
Which is -4 cosθ +4 cos2θ
So modulus squared is 4 cos2θ -4 cosθ
But also, from the earlier steps, after cancellation of terms, yes, that remains.
So modulus squared of the second term |1 - z + z2| is 4 cos2θ -4 cosθ.
Therefore, modulus is sqrt(4 cos2θ -4 cosθ )
So sqrt(4 cosθ (cosθ -1 ) )
Wait, but 4 cos2θ -4 cosθ = 4 cosθ (cosθ -1 )
But wait, since cosθ -1 is negative because cosθ <=1, so 4 cosθ (cosθ -1 ) is negative times cosθ.
Hmm, but then sqrt(4 cos2θ -4 cosθ )?
Wait, but modulus squared can't be negative.
Wait, there must be a mistake in my calculations.
Wait, that's a problem.
If modulus squared is coming out to be 4 cos2θ -4 cosθ, which can be positive or negative?
Wait, modulus squared has to be non-negative.
Hmm, something went wrong in my algebra.
Let me check my steps again.
Starting from the modulus squared of |1 - z + z2|:
Computed as [1 - cosθ + cos2θ]^2 + [-sinθ + sin2θ]^2.
Let me compute each component step by step.
First, expand [1 - cosθ + cos2θ]^2:
= (1 - cosθ)^2 + 2(1 - cosθ)(cos2θ) + (cos2θ)^2
= 1 - 2cosθ + cos2θ + 2cos2θ - 2cos3θ + cos4θ
Wait, wait, hold on.
Wait, (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 where a = (1 - cosθ) and b = cos2θ.
So:
a^2 = (1 - cosθ)^2 = 1 - 2cosθ + cos2θ
2ab = 2*(1 - cosθ)*cos2θ = 2cos2θ - 2cos3θ
b^2 = (cos2θ)^2 = cos4θ
Similarly, the other part [ - sinθ + sin2θ ]^2:
= (-sinθ)^2 + 2*(-sinθ)*(sin2θ) + (sin2θ)^2
= sin2θ - 2 sinθ sin2θ + sin2(2θ)
= sin2θ - 2 sinθ*(2 sinθ cosθ ) + 4 sin2θ cos2θ
= sin2θ - 4 sin2θ cosθ + 4 sin2θ cos2θ
Now, adding both parts together:
Starting with the real part squared:
1 - 2cosθ + cos2θ + 2cos2θ - 2cos3θ + cos4θ
Imaginary part squared:
sin2θ - 4 sin2θ cosθ + 4 sin2θ cos2θ
Now, sum all terms:
1 -2cosθ + cos2θ +2cos2θ -2cos3θ +cos4θ + sin2θ -4 sin2θ cosθ +4 sin2θ cos2θ
Combine like terms:
Let's think in parallel.

The expression is 1 -2cosθ + 3cos2θ -2cos3θ + cos4θ + sin2θ -4 sin2θ cosθ +4 sin2θ cos2θ.

The term 4 sin2θ cos2θ remains.
The expression is therefore 1 + sin2θ - 2cosθ + 3cos2θ - 2cos3θ + cos4θ - 4 sin2θ cosθ + 4 sin2θ cos2θ.
The term 1 + sin2θ simplifies to 1 + (1 - cos2θ), which is 2 - cos2θ.
The expression is now 2 - cos2θ - 2cosθ + 3cos2θ - 2cos3θ + cos4θ - 4 sin2θ cosθ + 4 sin2θ cos2θ.
The terms -cos2θ and +3cos2θ combine to 2cos2θ.
The expression is now 2 - 2cosθ + 2cos2θ - 2cos3θ + cos4θ - 4 sin2θ cosθ + 4 sin2θ cos2θ.
The term -4 sin2θ cosθ is considered.
The identity sin2θ = 1 - cos2θ is recalled.
The term -4 sin2θ cosθ becomes -4(1 - cos2θ)cosθ, which is -4cosθ + 4cos3θ.
The term 4 sin2θ cos2θ is considered.
The identity sin2θ = 1 - cos2θ is applied.
The term 4 sin2θ cos2θ becomes 4(1 - cos2θ)cos2θ, which is 4cos2θ - 4cos4θ.
The expression is now 2 - 2cosθ + 2cos2θ - 2cos3θ + cos4θ -4cosθ +4cos3θ +4cos2θ -4cos4θ.
The term -4cosθ is combined with -2cosθ to get -6cosθ.

The term 4cos2θ is combined with 2cos2θ to get 6cos2θ.
The term -4cos4θ is combined with cos4θ to get -3cos4θ.
The expression simplifies to 2 -6cosθ +6cos2θ +2cos3θ -3cos4θ.

So modulus squared is 2 -6cosθ +6cos2θ +2cos3θ -3cos4θ
Hmm, that's a fourth-degree polynomial in cosθ.
This seems complicated.
Maybe there's a better approach.
Alternatively, maybe use vectors or geometry.
Let me think.
The expression is |1 + z| + |1 - z + z2|.
Since |z| = 1, the point z is on the unit circle in the complex plane.
So perhaps we can interpret |1 + z| and |1 - z + z2| geometrically.
Let me recall that |a + b| is the length of the vector sum of a and b if represented as vectors.
But here, maybe using the triangle inequality?
The triangle inequality tells us that |a| + |b| ≥ |a + b|, but it's not directly helpful here since we have two different expressions.
Alternatively, maybe express both terms in terms of z and then combine them.
Wait, let's think.
Let me denote f(z) = |1 + z| + |1 - z + z2|.
We need to maximize f(z) over the unit circle.
Perhaps use calculus.
Since z is on the unit circle, we can parameterize it as z = e^(iθ), then express f(θ) = |1 + e^(iθ)| + |1 - e^(iθ) + e^(2iθ)|, then find the maximum of f(θ) over θ from 0 to 2π.
But this might involve some computation.
Alternatively, maybe use the method of Lagrange multipliers, but since it's a complex function, not sure.
Alternatively, use the triangle inequality or other inequalities to bound |1 + z| + |1 - z + z2|.
Let me think.
First, |1 + z| is the distance from -1 to z in the complex plane.
Similarly, |1 - z + z2| can be rewritten as |(z - ω)(z - ω^2)| where ω is a primitive third root of unity, but not sure if that's helpful.
Wait, 1 - z + z2 = 0 are the roots ω and ω2, the primitive 3rd roots of unity.
So indeed, 1 - z + z2 = (1 - ω z)(1 - ω2 z) ?
Wait, maybe factor 1 - z + z2.
Let me try:
Suppose 1 - z + z2 = 0, then z = [1 ± √(1 - 4)] / 2 = [1 ± √(-3)] / 2 = [1 ± i√3]/2.
Which are exactly the primitive third roots of unity, ω and ω2.
Therefore, 1 - z + z2 = (1 - ω z)(1 - ω2 z).
Let me check:
Expanding (1 - ω z)(1 - ω2 z) = 1 - (ω + ω2)z + ω3 z2.
Since ω3 = 1, this is 1 - (ω + ω2)z + z2.
And since ω + ω2 = -1 (because 1 + ω + ω2 = 0), so ω + ω2 = -1.
Therefore, it becomes 1 - (-1)z + z2 = 1 + z + z2.
Wait, that's not correct.
Wait, maybe I made a mistake.
Wait, the quadratic is 1 - z + z2, but when I expand (1 - ω z)(1 - ω2 z), I get 1 - (ω + ω2)z + ω3 z2.
Since ω3 = 1, that term is z2.
And ω + ω2 = -1, so it's 1 - (-1)z + z2 = 1 + z + z2.
That's different from 1 - z + z2.
So that factorization is incorrect.
Wait, maybe my mistake.
Let me think.
If 1 - z + z2 = 0, then roots are ω and ω2, so it should factor as (z - ω)(z - ω2).
But:
(z - ω)(z - ω2) = z2 - (ω + ω2)z + ω3 = z2 - (-1)z + 1 = z2 + z +1.
Which is different from 1 - z + z2.
Hmm, so that's not the same.
Therefore, 1 - z + z2 is not the same as z2 + z +1.
Wait, unless I'm missing a scaling factor.
Wait, z2 + z +1 = 0 is the equation for primitive third roots, but 1 - z + z2 is similar.
Wait, perhaps 1 - z + z2 can be related to a reciprocal or something.
Let me check:
If I let f(z) = 1 - z + z2, then f(1/z) = 1 -1/z +1/z2.
But since |z| =1, z̄ = 1/z.
Not sure if that helps.
Alternatively, maybe write 1 - z + z2 = (z - conjugate of ω)(something).
Alternatively, maybe this approach isn't helpful.
Let's drop factorization for now.
Let's go back to parametrization.
Let me set z = e^(iθ) = cosθ + i sinθ.
Then compute |1 + z| and |1 - z + z2| in terms of θ.
First, |1 + z| is easy:
1 + z = 1 + cosθ + i sinθ.
Therefore, |1 + z| = sqrt{(1 + cosθ)^2 + sin2θ} = sqrt{1 + 2cosθ + cos2θ + sin2θ} = sqrt{2 + 2cosθ} = 2 |cos(θ/2)|.
Because sqrt{2 + 2cosθ} = 2 sqrt{(cos2(θ/2) + sin2(θ/2)) + cos2(θ/2) - sin2(θ/2)} ?
Wait, no.
Wait, sqrt{2 + 2cosθ} = 2 sqrt{(1 + cosθ)/2} = 2 |cos(θ/2)|, using the half-angle formula, since cos(θ/2) can be positive or negative depending on θ.
So yes, |1 + z| = 2 |cos(θ/2)|.
Similarly, let's compute |1 - z + z2|.
Let me first compute 1 - z + z2.
Since z = e^(iθ), z2 = e^(i2θ).
Therefore:
1 - z + z2 = 1 - e^(iθ) + e^(i2θ).
Expressed in terms of trigonometric functions:
Real part: 1 - cosθ + cos2θ
Imaginary part: -sinθ + sin2θ
Therefore, |1 - z + z2| = sqrt{(1 - cosθ + cos2θ)^2 + (-sinθ + sin2θ)^2}
Let me square that expression:

</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So |1 - z + z2| = sqrt{2 -6cosθ +6cos2θ +2cos3θ -3cos4θ}
Hmm, that's a complicated expression.
Maybe let me denote x = cosθ, then this becomes sqrt{2 -6x +6x2 +2x3 -3x4}.
Then our total function to maximize is f(x) = 2 sqrt{(1 + x)/2} + sqrt{2 -6x +6x2 +2x3 -3x4}, where x ∈ [-1, 1].
Wait, but x = cosθ, so x ranges from -1 to 1.
But since sqrt{(1 + x)/2} is |cos(θ/2)|, which is sqrt{(1 + cosθ)/2} = |cos(θ/2)|, so actually the first term is 2*sqrt{(1 + x)/2} = 2*sqrt{(1 + x)/2} = sqrt{2(1 + x)}.
Which is 2* that, wait, 2*sqrt{(1 + x)/2} = sqrt{4*(1 + x)/2} = sqrt{2(1 + x)}.
So maybe write f(x) = sqrt{2(1 + x)} + sqrt{2 -6x +6x2 +2x3 -3x4}
Hmm, maybe.
But perhaps instead of switching to x, just accept that this will be a complicated function and think about calculus.
Alternatively, notice that both expressions involve trigonometric functions and could be simplified using identities.
Alternatively, use substitution.
Let me note that 2 -6x +6x2 +2x3 -3x4.
Hmm.
Let me see if that factors.
Let me write it as -3x4 +2x3 +6x2 -6x +2.
Let me try to factor.

Testing x=1: -3 +2 +6 -6 +2 = -3 + 2 = -1; +6 -6 = 0; +2 =2; Sum: -1 +0 +2=1 ≠0.
x=-1: -3(-4)^2 +2(-1)^3 +6(-1)^2 -6(-1) +2= -3(1) + 2(-1) +6(1) -6(-1) +2= -3 -2 +6 +6 +2=9≠0.
x=2: -3(16) + 2(8) +6(4) -6(2) +2= -48 +16 +24 -12 +2= (-48 +16) + (24 -12) +2= -32 +12 +2= -18≠0.
Hmm, doesn't seem to have rational roots.
Maybe factor in pairs.
Alternatively, group terms:
(-3x4 +2x3) + (6x2 -6x +2)
= x3(-3x +2) + (6x2 -6x +2)
Doesn't seem to help.
Alternatively, maybe factor out a -3x2:
But -3x4 +2x3 +6x2 +...: Nope.
Alternatively, maybe this is a quadratic in some variable.
Alternatively, use substitution y = x2.
But the original is a fourth-degree polynomial.
Alternatively, maybe write in terms of multiple angles.
Let me try:
Let me note that 2 - 6x + 6x2 - 3x4 is part of the expression.
Wait, the expression inside the sqrt is 2 -6x +6x2 +2x3 -3x4.
Let me write this as:
-3x4 +2x3 +6x2 -6x +2.
Hmm.
Alternatively, think about combining terms:
Maybe express in terms of cos 2θ.
Since x = cosθ.
Let me recall that cos2θ = 2cos2θ -1, so cos2θ = (cos2θ +1)/2.
Similarly, cos3θ = 4cos3θ -3cosθ, so cos3θ =4x3 -3x if x=cosθ.
Similarly, cos4θ=8x4 -8x2 +1.
Hmm.
So perhaps express the polynomial in terms of multiple angles.
Let me see:
Given that x=cosθ, so:
Let me note that:
x4 term: -3x4 = -3(cosθ)^4
x3 term: +2x3= +2(cosθ)^3
x2: +6x2= +6(cosθ)^2
x: -6x= -6cosθ
constants: +2
Let me see if I can express this as a combination of cosθ, cos2θ, cos3θ, cos4θ.

solve the following math problem: let $z$ be a complex number such that $|z| = 1.$  find the maximum value of
\[|1 + z| + |1 - z + z^2|.\]
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
<think>
okay, so i need to find the maximum value of |1 + z| + |1 - z + z2| given that |z| = 1.
hmm, complex numbers with modulus conditions.
i remember that when dealing with complex numbers on the unit circle, it can be useful to represent them in their polar form.
so maybe i can let z = e^(iθ), where θ is the angle from 0 to 2π.
that might help me visualize the problem.
let me write that down: z = cosθ + i sinθ.
then, i can substitute this into the expressions |1 + z| and |1 - z + z2| and try to compute them.
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>
<goal>
<outline>
1: express the first term |1+z| in terms of θ.
</outline>
<outline>
2: express the second term |1-z+z²| in terms of θ.
</outline>
</goal>
<path>
1: first, let's handle |1 + z|.
if z = e^(iθ), then 1 + z is 1 + cosθ + i sinθ.
the modulus of this is sqrt{(1 + cosθ)^2 + (sinθ)^2}.
let's compute that:
sqrt[(1 + cosθ)^2 + sin2θ] = sqrt[1 + 2cosθ + cos2θ + sin2θ]
simplify using the pythagorean identity: sin2θ + cos2θ = 1.
so that becomes sqrt[1 + 2cosθ + 1] = sqrt[2 + 2cosθ].
that simplifies further to sqrt[2(1 + cosθ)].
and if i recall, 1 + cosθ is 2 cos2(θ/2), from the half-angle formula.
so sqrt[4 cos2(θ/2)] = 2 |cos(θ/2)|.
but since θ can be any angle, cos(θ/2) can be positive or negative, but the modulus would make it absolute.
therefore, |1 + z| = 2 |cos(θ/2)|.
hmm, but wait, is that the case?
wait, actually, wait: wait, 1 + z is 1 + cosθ + i sinθ.
let me compute modulus: sqrt{(1 + cosθ)^2 + (sinθ)^2} = sqrt{1 + 2cosθ + cos2θ + sin2θ} = sqrt{2 + 2cosθ}.
so that's correct.
then sqrt{2 + 2cosθ} = 2 |cos(θ/2)|, right?
because 2 + 2cosθ = 2(1 + cosθ) = 2 * 2cos2(θ/2) = 4 cos2(θ/2 ).
therefore sqrt{4 cos2(θ/2)} = 2 |cos(θ/2) |.
so yes, |1 + z| = 2 |cos(θ/2)|.
okay, got that.
</path>
<path>
2: similarly, the second term |1 - z + z2|.
let me compute 1 - z + z2 first.
let's substitute z = e^(iθ):
1 - e^(iθ) + e^(i2θ)
again, breaking into real and imaginary parts.
real part: 1 - cosθ + cos(2θ)
imaginary part: -sinθ + sin(2θ)
so the modulus squared would be [1 - cosθ + cos(2θ)]2 + [-sinθ + sin(2θ)]2.
let me compute that.
first, expand [1 - cosθ + cos(2θ)]2:
= (1 - cosθ)^2 + 2(1 - cosθ)cos(2θ) + cos2(2θ)
= 1 - 2cosθ + cos2θ + 2cos(2θ) - 2cosθ cos(2θ) + cos2(2θ)
similarly, expand [-sinθ + sin(2θ)]2:
= sin2θ - 2sinθ sin(2θ) + sin2(2θ)
= sin2θ - 2sinθ sin(2θ) + sin2(2θ)
let me double-check.
wait, hang on, actually:
wait, [ - sinθ + sin(2θ) ]2 = sin2θ - 2 sinθ sin(2θ) + sin2(2θ).
yes, that's right.
so putting it all together, modulus squared is:
[1 - cosθ + cos(2θ)]2 + [ - sinθ + sin(2θ) ]2
= (1 - cosθ + cos(2θ))^2 + ( - sinθ + sin(2θ) )^2
let me compute this step by step.
first, expand each bracket:
for the real parts:
1 - 2cosθ + cos2θ + 2cos(2θ) (from the -2cosθ*cos(2θ) term)
wait, maybe expanding correctly:
wait, (a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc.
so let's think:
let me denote:
a = 1 - cosθ, b = cos(2θ).
so (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2.
so:
a^2 = (1 - cosθ)^2 = 1 - 2cosθ + cos2θ
2ab = 2*(1 - cosθ)*cos(2θ) = 2*cos(2θ) - 2*cosθ*cos(2θ)
b^2 = cos2(2θ)
similarly, the imaginary part:
(- sinθ + sin(2θ) )^2
= (-sinθ)^2 + 2*(-sinθ)*(sin(2θ)) + (sin(2θ))^2
= sin2θ - 2 sinθ sin(2θ) + sin2(2θ)
so adding the real part squared and imaginary part squared gives total modulus squared.
so combining the two:
modulus squared of the second term is:
[1 - cosθ]^2 + 2*(1 - cosθ)*cos(2θ) + cos2(2θ) + sin2θ - 2 sinθ sin(2θ) + sin2(2θ)
wait, let me group terms:
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>
<goal>
<outline>
1: simplify the expression for the modulus squared of the second term by grouping and combining like terms.
</outline>
<outline>
2: simplify the remaining part of the expression for the modulus squared of the second term by grouping and combining like terms.
</outline>
</goal>
<path>
1: the terms [1 - cosθ]^2 and sin2θ are combined. the term [1 - cosθ]^2 expands to 1 - 2cosθ + cos2θ. the sum of 1 - 2cosθ + cos2θ and sin2θ is 1 - 2cosθ + (cos2θ + sin2θ), which simplifies to 1 - 2cosθ + 1, resulting in 2 - 2cosθ.
the expression for the modulus squared is now 2 - 2cosθ plus the remaining terms.
the remaining terms are 2*(1 - cosθ)*cos(2θ), cos2(2θ), -2 sinθ sin(2θ), and sin2(2θ).
</path>
<path>
2: the remaining terms are -2 sinθ sin(2θ) and cos2(2θ) + sin2(2θ). the term cos2(2θ) + sin2(2θ) simplifies to 1. the expression therefore becomes 3 - 2cosθ - 2cosθ cos(2θ) - 2sinθ sin(2θ).
</path>
<conclusion>
the modulus squared of the second term simplifies to 2 - 2cosθ + 2*(1 - cosθ)*cos(2θ) - 2 sinθ sin(2θ).
</conclusion>
</parallel>
wait, let's see:
wait, perhaps we can use some trigonometric identities here.
let me recall that cos(2θ) = 2cos2θ - 1 = 1 - 2sin2θ, and sin(2θ) = 2sinθ cosθ.
so maybe express everything in terms of cosθ and sinθ.
let me try to substitute cos(2θ) and sin(2θ):
so, the term -2 sinθ sin(2θ) becomes -2 sinθ*(2 sinθ cosθ ) = -4 sin2θ cosθ
similarly, -2 cosθ cos(2θ) becomes -2 cosθ*(2 cos2θ - 1) = -4 cos3θ + 2 cosθ
therefore, substituting back:
so the modulus squared becomes:
2 - 2cosθ + 2*(1 - cosθ)*(2cos2θ -1 ) -4 sin2θ cosθ
wait, let me double-check:
wait, the term 2*(1 - cosθ)*cos(2θ):
cos(2θ) = 2cos2θ -1, so:
2*(1 - cosθ)*(2cos2θ -1 )
similarly, -2 sinθ sin(2θ) becomes -4 sin2θ cosθ as above.
so expanding 2*(1 - cosθ)*(2cos2θ -1 ):
first, expand (1 - cosθ)(2cos2θ -1 ):
multiply 1*(2cos2θ -1 ) = 2cos2θ -1
multiply -cosθ*(2cos2θ -1 ) = -2cos3θ + cosθ
so total: 2cos2θ -1 -2cos3θ + cosθ
multiply by 2: 4cos2θ -2 -4cos3θ + 2cosθ
therefore, modulus squared is:
2 - 2cosθ + 4cos2θ -2 -4cos3θ + 2cosθ -4 sin2θ cosθ
simplify terms:
2 -2 cancels out.
-2cosθ +2cosθ cancels.
so remaining terms: 4cos2θ -4cos3θ -4 sin2θ cosθ
factor out -4 cosθ:
-4 cosθ( cos2θ - cosθ + sin2θ )
hmm.
inside the bracket: cos2θ - cosθ + sin2θ
but cos2θ + sin2θ = 1, so that becomes 1 - cosθ
therefore, modulus squared is -4 cosθ (1 - cosθ )
wait, so:
-4 cosθ (1 - cosθ ) = -4 cosθ + 4 cos2θ
so modulus squared is 4 cos2θ -4 cosθ
but wait, let's verify that step again:
original modulus squared after expansion:
2 -2cosθ +4cos2θ -4cos3θ -4 sin2θ cosθ
but then when factoring, i grouped the last three terms?
wait, wait, perhaps i made a mistake there.
let me check again.
wait, starting from:
4cos2θ -4cos3θ -4 sin2θ cosθ
factor out -4 cosθ:
first term: 4cos2θ = -4 cosθ*(-cosθ)
second term: -4 cos3θ = -4 cosθ*(cos2θ )
third term: -4 sin2θ cosθ = -4 cosθ* sin2θ
therefore, factor out -4 cosθ:
-4 cosθ( -cosθ + cos2θ + sin2θ )
simplify inside the bracket:
-cosθ + cos2θ + sin2θ = (-cosθ) + (cos2θ + sin2θ ) = (-cosθ) +1 = 1 - cosθ
therefore, modulus squared is -4 cosθ*(1 - cosθ )
which is -4 cosθ +4 cos2θ
so modulus squared is 4 cos2θ -4 cosθ
but also, from the earlier steps, after cancellation of terms, yes, that remains.
so modulus squared of the second term |1 - z + z2| is 4 cos2θ -4 cosθ.
therefore, modulus is sqrt(4 cos2θ -4 cosθ )
so sqrt(4 cosθ (cosθ -1 ) )
wait, but 4 cos2θ -4 cosθ = 4 cosθ (cosθ -1 )
but wait, since cosθ -1 is negative because cosθ <=1, so 4 cosθ (cosθ -1 ) is negative times cosθ.
hmm, but then sqrt(4 cos2θ -4 cosθ )?
wait, but modulus squared can't be negative.
wait, there must be a mistake in my calculations.
wait, that's a problem.
if modulus squared is coming out to be 4 cos2θ -4 cosθ, which can be positive or negative?
wait, modulus squared has to be non-negative.
hmm, something went wrong in my algebra.
let me check my steps again.
starting from the modulus squared of |1 - z + z2|:
computed as [1 - cosθ + cos2θ]^2 + [-sinθ + sin2θ]^2.
let me compute each component step by step.
first, expand [1 - cosθ + cos2θ]^2:
= (1 - cosθ)^2 + 2(1 - cosθ)(cos2θ) + (cos2θ)^2
= 1 - 2cosθ + cos2θ + 2cos2θ - 2cos3θ + cos4θ
wait, wait, hold on.
wait, (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 where a = (1 - cosθ) and b = cos2θ.
so:
a^2 = (1 - cosθ)^2 = 1 - 2cosθ + cos2θ
2ab = 2*(1 - cosθ)*cos2θ = 2cos2θ - 2cos3θ
b^2 = (cos2θ)^2 = cos4θ
similarly, the other part [ - sinθ + sin2θ ]^2:
= (-sinθ)^2 + 2*(-sinθ)*(sin2θ) + (sin2θ)^2
= sin2θ - 2 sinθ sin2θ + sin2(2θ)
= sin2θ - 2 sinθ*(2 sinθ cosθ ) + 4 sin2θ cos2θ
= sin2θ - 4 sin2θ cosθ + 4 sin2θ cos2θ
now, adding both parts together:
starting with the real part squared:
1 - 2cosθ + cos2θ + 2cos2θ - 2cos3θ + cos4θ
imaginary part squared:
sin2θ - 4 sin2θ cosθ + 4 sin2θ cos2θ
now, sum all terms:
1 -2cosθ + cos2θ +2cos2θ -2cos3θ +cos4θ + sin2θ -4 sin2θ cosθ +4 sin2θ cos2θ
combine like terms:
let's think in parallel.

1: the constant term is 1. the linear cosθ term is -2cosθ. the cos^2θ terms are cos2θ + 2cos2θ, which sum to 3cos2θ. the cos^3θ term is -2cos3θ is identified. the cos^4θ term is cos^4θ is identified. the sin^2θ term is sin2θ.
the expression is 1 -2cosθ + 3cos2θ -2cos3θ + cos4θ + sin2θ -4 sin2θ cosθ +4 sin2θ cos2θ.
the terms 1 and -2cosθ are combined.
the terms 3cos2θ and -2cos3θ is identified.
the term cos^4θ is identified.

the expression is therefore 1 - 2cosθ + 3cos2θ -2cos3θ +cos4θ + sin2θ -4 sin2θ cosθ +4 sin2θ cos2θ.
the term 1 and sin2θ are identified.
the term -2cosθ is identified.

the term 3cos2θ remains.
the term -2cos3θ remains.
the term cos4θ remains.
the term -4 sin2θ cosθ remains.
the term 4 sin2θ cos2θ remains.
the expression is therefore 1 + sin2θ - 2cosθ + 3cos2θ - 2cos3θ + cos4θ - 4 sin2θ cosθ + 4 sin2θ cos2θ.
the term 1 + sin2θ simplifies to 1 + (1 - cos2θ), which is 2 - cos2θ.
the expression is now 2 - cos2θ - 2cosθ + 3cos2θ - 2cos3θ + cos4θ - 4 sin2θ cosθ + 4 sin2θ cos2θ.
the terms -cos2θ and +3cos2θ combine to 2cos2θ.
the expression is now 2 - 2cosθ + 2cos2θ - 2cos3θ + cos4θ - 4 sin2θ cosθ + 4 sin2θ cos2θ.
the term -4 sin2θ cosθ is considered.
the identity sin2θ = 1 - cos2θ is recalled.
the term -4 sin2θ cosθ becomes -4(1 - cos2θ)cosθ, which is -4cosθ + 4cos3θ.
the term 4 sin2θ cos2θ is considered.
the identity sin2θ = 1 - cos2θ is applied.
the term 4 sin2θ cos2θ becomes 4(1 - cos2θ)cos2θ, which is 4cos2θ - 4cos4θ.
the expression is now 2 - 2cosθ + 2cos2θ - 2cos3θ + cos4θ -4cosθ +4cos3θ +4cos2θ -4cos4θ.
the term -4cosθ is combined with -2cosθ to get -6cosθ.
the term 4cos3θ is combined with -2cos3θ to get 2cos3θ.
the term 4cos2θ is combined with 2cos2θ to get 6cos2θ.
the term -4cos4θ is combined with cos4θ to get -3cos4θ.
the expression simplifies to 2 -6cosθ +6cos2θ +2cos3θ -3cos4θ.
</path>
<conclusion>
the combined expression simplifies to 2 - 6cosθ + 6cos2θ + 2cos3θ - 3cos4θ after grouping and combining like terms.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
so modulus squared is 2 -6cosθ +6cos2θ +2cos3θ -3cos4θ
hmm, that's a fourth-degree polynomial in cosθ.
this seems complicated.
maybe there's a better approach.
alternatively, maybe use vectors or geometry.
let me think.
the expression is |1 + z| + |1 - z + z2|.
since |z| = 1, the point z is on the unit circle in the complex plane.
so perhaps we can interpret |1 + z| and |1 - z + z2| geometrically.
let me recall that |a + b| is the length of the vector sum of a and b if represented as vectors.
but here, maybe using the triangle inequality?
the triangle inequality tells us that |a| + |b| ≥ |a + b|, but it's not directly helpful here since we have two different expressions.
alternatively, maybe express both terms in terms of z and then combine them.
wait, let's think.
let me denote f(z) = |1 + z| + |1 - z + z2|.
we need to maximize f(z) over the unit circle.
perhaps use calculus.
since z is on the unit circle, we can parameterize it as z = e^(iθ), then express f(θ) = |1 + e^(iθ)| + |1 - e^(iθ) + e^(2iθ)|, then find the maximum of f(θ) over θ from 0 to 2π.
but this might involve some computation.
alternatively, maybe use the method of lagrange multipliers, but since it's a complex function, not sure.
alternatively, use the triangle inequality or other inequalities to bound |1 + z| + |1 - z + z2|.
let me think.
first, |1 + z| is the distance from -1 to z in the complex plane.
similarly, |1 - z + z2| can be rewritten as |(z - ω)(z - ω^2)| where ω is a primitive third root of unity, but not sure if that's helpful.
wait, 1 - z + z2 = 0 are the roots ω and ω2, the primitive 3rd roots of unity.
so indeed, 1 - z + z2 = (1 - ω z)(1 - ω2 z) ?
wait, maybe factor 1 - z + z2.
let me try:
suppose 1 - z + z2 = 0, then z = [1 ± √(1 - 4)] / 2 = [1 ± √(-3)] / 2 = [1 ± i√3]/2.
which are exactly the primitive third roots of unity, ω and ω2.
therefore, 1 - z + z2 = (1 - ω z)(1 - ω2 z).
let me check:
expanding (1 - ω z)(1 - ω2 z) = 1 - (ω + ω2)z + ω3 z2.
since ω3 = 1, this is 1 - (ω + ω2)z + z2.
and since ω + ω2 = -1 (because 1 + ω + ω2 = 0), so ω + ω2 = -1.
therefore, it becomes 1 - (-1)z + z2 = 1 + z + z2.
wait, that's not correct.
wait, maybe i made a mistake.
wait, the quadratic is 1 - z + z2, but when i expand (1 - ω z)(1 - ω2 z), i get 1 - (ω + ω2)z + ω3 z2.
since ω3 = 1, that term is z2.
and ω + ω2 = -1, so it's 1 - (-1)z + z2 = 1 + z + z2.
that's different from 1 - z + z2.
so that factorization is incorrect.
wait, maybe my mistake.
let me think.
if 1 - z + z2 = 0, then roots are ω and ω2, so it should factor as (z - ω)(z - ω2).
but:
(z - ω)(z - ω2) = z2 - (ω + ω2)z + ω3 = z2 - (-1)z + 1 = z2 + z +1.
which is different from 1 - z + z2.
hmm, so that's not the same.
therefore, 1 - z + z2 is not the same as z2 + z +1.
wait, unless i'm missing a scaling factor.
wait, z2 + z +1 = 0 is the equation for primitive third roots, but 1 - z + z2 is similar.
wait, perhaps 1 - z + z2 can be related to a reciprocal or something.
let me check:
if i let f(z) = 1 - z + z2, then f(1/z) = 1 -1/z +1/z2.
but since |z| =1, z̄ = 1/z.
not sure if that helps.
alternatively, maybe write 1 - z + z2 = (z - conjugate of ω)(something).
alternatively, maybe this approach isn't helpful.
let's drop factorization for now.
let's go back to parametrization.
let me set z = e^(iθ) = cosθ + i sinθ.
then compute |1 + z| and |1 - z + z2| in terms of θ.
first, |1 + z| is easy:
1 + z = 1 + cosθ + i sinθ.
therefore, |1 + z| = sqrt{(1 + cosθ)^2 + sin2θ} = sqrt{1 + 2cosθ + cos2θ + sin2θ} = sqrt{2 + 2cosθ} = 2 |cos(θ/2)|.
because sqrt{2 + 2cosθ} = 2 sqrt{(cos2(θ/2) + sin2(θ/2)) + cos2(θ/2) - sin2(θ/2)} ?
wait, no.
wait, sqrt{2 + 2cosθ} = 2 sqrt{(1 + cosθ)/2} = 2 |cos(θ/2)|, using the half-angle formula, since cos(θ/2) can be positive or negative depending on θ.
so yes, |1 + z| = 2 |cos(θ/2)|.
similarly, let's compute |1 - z + z2|.
let me first compute 1 - z + z2.
since z = e^(iθ), z2 = e^(i2θ).
therefore:
1 - z + z2 = 1 - e^(iθ) + e^(i2θ).
expressed in terms of trigonometric functions:
real part: 1 - cosθ + cos2θ
imaginary part: -sinθ + sin2θ
therefore, |1 - z + z2| = sqrt{(1 - cosθ + cos2θ)^2 + (-sinθ + sin2θ)^2}
let me square that expression:
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>
<goal>
<outline>
1: simplify the expression for the modulus squared of the second term by grouping and combining like terms.
</outline>
<outline>
2: simplify the remaining part of the expression for the modulus squared of the second term by grouping and combining like terms.
</outline>
</goal>
<path>
1: the terms [1 - cosθ]^2 and sin2θ are combined. the term [1 - cosθ]^2 expands to 1 - 2cosθ + cos2θ. the sum of 1 - 2cosθ + cos2θ and sin2θ is 1 - 2cosθ + (cos2θ + sin2θ), which simplifies to 1 - 2cosθ + 1, resulting in 2 - 2cosθ.
the expression for the modulus squared is now 2 - 2cosθ plus the remaining terms.
the remaining terms are 2*(1 - cosθ)*cos(2θ), cos2(2θ), -2 sinθ sin(2θ), and sin2(2θ).
</path>
<path>
2: the terms -2 sinθ sin2θ and -2 cosθ cos2θ] combine to -2 cosθ cos2θ - 2 sinθ sin2θ], which is -2 [cosθ cos2θ + sinθ sin2θ]. using the identity cosθ cos2θ + sinθ sin2θ = cos(θ - 2θ) = cos(-θ) = cosθ, this simplifies to -2 cosθ. the terms [1^2 + (-cosθ)^2 + cos2θ^2] combine to 1 + cos2θ + cos22θ. the terms [sin2θ + (-sinθ)^2 + sin22θ] combine to sin2θ + sin2θ + sin22θ = 2 sin2θ + sin22θ. the expression for the modulus squared is now 2 - 2cosθ + 2*(1 - cosθ)*cos2θ -4 sin2θ cosθ. the term -4 sin2θ cosθ is considered. the identity sin2θ = 1 - cos2θ is recalled. the term -4 sin2θ cosθ becomes -4(1 - cos2θ)cosθ, which is -4cosθ + 4cos3θ. the term 4 sin2θ cos2θ is considered. the identity sin2θ = 1 - cos2θ is applied. the term 4 sin2θ cos2θ becomes 4(1 - cos2θ)cos2θ, which is 4cos2θ - 4cos4θ. the expression is now 2 - 6cosθ + 6cos2θ + 2cos3θ - 3cos4θ.
</path>
<conclusion>
the modulus squared of the second term simplifies to 2 - 2cosθ + 2*(1 - cosθ)*cos(2θ) - 2 sinθ sin(2θ).
the modulus squared of the second term simplifies to 2 - 2cosθ + 2*(1 - cosθ)*cos(2θ) - 4 sin2θ cosθ.
the modulus squared of the second term simplifies to 2 - 2cosθ + 2*(1 - cosθ)*cos(2θ) - 4 sin2θ cosθ.
the modulus squared of the second term simplifies to 2 - 6cosθ + 6cos2θ + 2cos3θ - 3cos4θ.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
so |1 - z + z2| = sqrt{2 -6cosθ +6cos2θ +2cos3θ -3cos4θ}
hmm, that's a complicated expression.
maybe let me denote x = cosθ, then this becomes sqrt{2 -6x +6x2 +2x3 -3x4}.
then our total function to maximize is f(x) = 2 sqrt{(1 + x)/2} + sqrt{2 -6x +6x2 +2x3 -3x4}, where x ∈ [-1, 1].
wait, but x = cosθ, so x ranges from -1 to 1.
but since sqrt{(1 + x)/2} is |cos(θ/2)|, which is sqrt{(1 + cosθ)/2} = |cos(θ/2)|, so actually the first term is 2*sqrt{(1 + x)/2} = 2*sqrt{(1 + x)/2} = sqrt{2(1 + x)}.
which is 2* that, wait, 2*sqrt{(1 + x)/2} = sqrt{4*(1 + x)/2} = sqrt{2(1 + x)}.
so maybe write f(x) = sqrt{2(1 + x)} + sqrt{2 -6x +6x2 +2x3 -3x4}
hmm, maybe.
but perhaps instead of switching to x, just accept that this will be a complicated function and think about calculus.
alternatively, notice that both expressions involve trigonometric functions and could be simplified using identities.
alternatively, use substitution.
let me note that 2 -6x +6x2 +2x3 -3x4.
hmm.
let me see if that factors.
let me write it as -3x4 +2x3 +6x2 -6x +2.
let me try to factor.
possible rational roots via rational root theorem: ±1, ±2, ±1/3, ±2/3.
testing x=1: -3 +2 +6 -6 +2 = -3 + 2 = -1; +6 -6 = 0; +2 =2; sum: -1 +0 +2=1 ≠0.
x=-1: -3(-4)^2 +2(-1)^3 +6(-1)^2 -6(-1) +2= -3(1) + 2(-1) +6(1) -6(-1) +2= -3 -2 +6 +6 +2=9≠0.
x=2: -3(16) + 2(8) +6(4) -6(2) +2= -48 +16 +24 -12 +2= (-48 +16) + (24 -12) +2= -32 +12 +2= -18≠0.
hmm, doesn't seem to have rational roots.
maybe factor in pairs.
alternatively, group terms:
(-3x4 +2x3) + (6x2 -6x +2)
= x3(-3x +2) + (6x2 -6x +2)
doesn't seem to help.
alternatively, maybe factor out a -3x2:
but -3x4 +2x3 +6x2 +...: nope.
alternatively, maybe this is a quadratic in some variable.
alternatively, use substitution y = x2.
but the original is a fourth-degree polynomial.
alternatively, maybe write in terms of multiple angles.
let me try:
let me note that 2 - 6x + 6x2 - 3x4 is part of the expression.
wait, the expression inside the sqrt is 2 -6x +6x2 +2x3 -3x4.
let me write this as:
-3x4 +2x3 +6x2 -6x +2.
hmm.
alternatively, think about combining terms:
maybe express in terms of cos 2θ.
since x = cosθ.
let me recall that cos2θ = 2cos2θ -1, so cos2θ = (cos2θ +1)/2.
similarly, cos3θ = 4cos3θ -3cosθ, so cos3θ =4x3 -3x if x=cosθ.
similarly, cos4θ=8x4 -8x2 +1.
hmm.
so perhaps express the polynomial in terms of multiple angles.
let me see:
given that x=cosθ, so:
let me note that:
x4 term: -3x4 = -3(cosθ)^4
x3 term: +2x3= +2(cosθ)^3
x2: +6x2= +6(cosθ)^2
x: -6x= -6cosθ
constants: +2
let me see if i can express this as a combination of cosθ, cos2θ, cos3θ, cos4θ.
