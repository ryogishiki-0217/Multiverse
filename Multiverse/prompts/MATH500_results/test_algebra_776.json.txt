Okay, so I have this math problem here where I need to find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial g(x), which is defined as f(x-1), and f(x) is given as 3x4 + 5x2 -9x -2.
Hmm, alright, let's think through this step by step.
First off, the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is what you get when you add up all the coefficients.
For example, if you have a polynomial like 2x2 + 3x + 4, the sum of the coefficients would be 2 + 3 + 4 = 9.
But in this case, the polynomial g(x) is f(x-1), which means we have to substitute (x-1) into f(x) and then expand it to find all the coefficients, right?
That sounds a bit tedious because f(x) is a fourth-degree polynomial, so expanding f(x-1) would involve the binomial theorem or maybe substitution, and then collecting like terms.
But maybe there's a shortcut here.
Because if I need the sum of the coefficients of g(x), is there a clever way to do this without expanding the entire polynomial?
Wait, let's recall that the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial p(x) is equal to p(1).
That's a useful trick, right?
Because if you plug x=1 into the polynomial, all the terms become the coefficients multiplied by 1, so you just get the sum of the coefficients.
For example, if p(x) = a x^n + b x^{n-1} + ... + c, then p(1) = a + b + ... + c.
So that means if I want the sum of the coefficients of g(x), I just need to compute g(1).
But since g(x) = f(x-1), then g(1) = f(1 - 1) = f(0).
Wait, hold on, let's check that again.
If g(x) = f(x - 1), then plugging x=1 into g(x) gives g(1) = f(1 - 1) = f(0).
So that means evaluating f at 0 gives the sum of the coefficients of g(x).
But that's really clever.
So instead of expanding the whole polynomial and finding each coefficient, which would take a long time, I can just compute f(0).
Let me verify this logic.
So, sum of coefficients of g(x) is g(1), since plugging x=1 into g(x) gives the sum of its coefficients.
But since g(x) is f(x - 1), then g(1) = f(1 - 1) = f(0).
Therefore, f(0) is equal to the sum of coefficients of g(x).
Is that accurate?
Let me double-check with a smaller example.
Let's say f(x) = 2x2 + 3x + 4.
Then g(x) = f(x - 1) = 2(x - 1)2 + 3(x - 1) + 4.
If I expand this out:
First, 2(x2 - 2x +1) = 2x2 -4x +2.
Then 3(x -1) = 3x -3.
Adding the +4 at the end.
So combining all terms: 2x2 -4x +2 + 3x -3 +4 = 2x2 -x +3.
So g(x) is 2x2 -x +3.
The sum of the coefficients is 2 -1 +3 = 4.
Now, compute f(0): original f(x) =2x2 +3x +4, so f(0)=0 +0 +4=4.
Which matches!
So yeah, that trick works.
So in general, the sum of coefficients of g(x) = f(x - c) would be f(-c), because substituting x=1 into g(x) gives f(1 - c).
But in this problem, c=1, so f(1 -1)=f(0).
Therefore, the sum of coefficients of g(x) is f(0).
So all I need to do is compute f(0).
Looking back at the problem, f(x)=3x4 +5x2 -9x -2.
So f(0) is just the constant term, which is -2.
Therefore, the sum of coefficients of g(x) is -2.
Wait, but hold on, that seems straightforward, have I made a mistake here?
Let me think again.
Because sometimes when you substitute x-1, especially with expanding the polynomial, maybe there's a miscalculation.
Wait, let me think through again.
If g(x) = f(x - 1), which is substitution, so to find the sum of coefficients of g(x), which is the same as evaluating g(1), because sum of coefficients is g(1).
But since g(x) = f(x - 1), then g(1) = f(1 - 1) = f(0).
Therefore, yes, f(0) is -2.
Therefore, the answer is -2.
But just to make sure, let me confirm with another example.
Suppose f(x) is a simple function.
Let's say f(x) = x.
Then g(x) = f(x -1) = x -1.
The sum of coefficients of g(x) is 1 -1 = 0.
Computing f(0) = 0.
Wait, that gives 0.
Hmm, but in this case, the sum is 0.
Wait, but in this example, the sum of coefficients is 1 (for x) and -1 (constant term), so 1 -1=0.
But f(0)= 0.
So that works.
Another example: f(x) = x2.
Then g(x) = (x -1)2 = x2 -2x +1.
The sum of coefficients is 1 -2 +1=0.
f(0)=02=0.
So that works.
Another example where maybe coefficients sum to something else.
Let's say f(x) = x + 2.
Then g(x) = (x -1) +2 = x +1.
Sum of coefficients: 1 +1=2.
f(0)= 0 +2=2.
So that works as well.
So the method seems valid.
Therefore, in the given problem, since f(x)=3x4 +5x2 -9x -2, then evaluating at x=0, we get f(0)=3(0)^4 +5(0)^2 -9(0) -2 = -2.
Hence, the sum of coefficients of g(x) is -2.
Therefore, the answer is -2.
But wait, the problem says "what is the sum of the coefficients of g".
So maybe I'm overcomplicating, but is this a trick question?
Because usually, sum of coefficients is positive, but in this case, it's negative.
But yes, since the constant term here is -2, and the sum of coefficients is equal to evaluating the polynomial at x=1.
Wait, no, for the original polynomial f(x), f(1) would be the sum of its coefficients.
But in this case, we're looking for the sum of coefficients of g(x), which is f(x-1).
So as established, that sum is equal to f(0).
Wait, so perhaps to clarify, the sum of coefficients of f(x) is f(1).
The sum of coefficients of g(x) is g(1).
But since g(x)=f(x-1), then g(1)=f(0).
Therefore, the sum of coefficients of g is f(0), which is -2.
So that is correct.
Alternatively, if for some reason the problem is phrased differently, but given the examples I tested, this holds up.
Therefore, the answer is -2.
**Final Answer**
\boxed{-2}
</Think>

Answer: To find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) \), which is defined as \( f(x-1) \), we can use the fact that the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is equal to \( p(1) \). 

Given \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \) is \( g(1) \). Substituting \( x = 1 \) into \( g(x) \), we get:
\[
g(1) = f(1 - 1) = f(0)
\]

Next, we evaluate \( f(0) \) for the polynomial \( f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2 \):
\[
f(0) = 3(0)^4 + 5(0)^2 - 9(0) - 2 = -2
\]

Thus, the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \) is:
\[
\boxed{-2}

answer: to find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) \), which is defined as \( f(x-1) \), we can use the fact that the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is equal to \( p(1) \). 

given \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \) is \( g(1) \). substituting \( x = 1 \) into \( g(x) \), we get:
\[
g(1) = f(1 - 1) = f(0)
\]

next, we evaluate \( f(0) \) for the polynomial \( f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2 \):
\[
f(0) = 3(0)^4 + 5(0)^2 - 9(0) - 2 = -2
\]

thus, the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \) is:
\[
\boxed{-2}
\]
