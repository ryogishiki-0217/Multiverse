Okay, let me try to figure out this probability problem. So, we have Bob and Alice each starting with a bag containing one ball of each color: blue, green, orange, red, and violet. That's five balls each. Then, Alice picks a random ball from her bag and puts it into Bob's bag. Then Bob picks a random ball from his bag (which now has six balls) and puts it into Alice's bag. We need to find the probability that after these two transfers, both bags have the same contents. That is, each bag still has one of each color. Hmm. Let's think through this step by step.
First, let's understand the initial setup. Each bag starts with 5 distinct colored balls. So, the composition of each bag is {blue, green, orange, red, violet}. Then, Alice takes one ball at random from her bag. Since she has 5 balls, each with equal probability, the probability of picking any particular color is 1/5. She then puts that ball into Bob's bag. Now, Bob's bag, which originally had 5 balls, now has 6 balls. Then Bob randomly selects one ball from his bag (which now has 6 balls) and puts it into Alice's bag. After Bob's transfer, his bag is back to 5 balls, and Alice's bag, which was left with 4 balls after her transfer, receives one ball, also returning to 5 balls. The question is: what's the probability that both bags end up with exactly one ball of each color again? So, essentially, after the exchange, neither Alice nor Bob has duplicate balls of any color. So, to solve this, maybe we can model the possible transfers and see in how many cases the final compositions match the original.
Let me consider the possible scenarios. Let's denote the ball Alice transfers to Bob as color A. Then Bob's bag now has all his original balls plus the ball of color A. Then Bob will pick a ball from his new 6-ball bag and give it to Alice. Let's denote the ball Bob gives back as color B. So, after the transfers, Alice's bag will have her original balls minus the ball of color A plus the ball of color B. Bob's bag will have his original balls plus color A minus color B.
For both bags to have the same contents as they started, Alice's bag must have all the original colors, which means that after she gave away color A and received color B, she must have all five colors. Similarly, Bob's bag must also have all five colors after receiving color A and giving away color B. Therefore, the necessary and sufficient condition is that color B (the ball Bob gives back to Alice) is equal to color A (the ball Alice gave to Bob). That is, if Alice gives a ball of color A to Bob, and then Bob gives a ball of color A back to her, then both will have their original sets. Because Alice will have her original set minus A plus A, which is the same as her original set. Similarly, Bob will have his original set plus A minus A, which is the same as his original set.
Wait, but is that the only way? Let me check. Suppose Alice gives a ball of color A to Bob. Then Bob's bag has one extra ball of color A. When Bob selects a ball from his bag to give back to Alice, he has six balls: his original five (including A, which was already in his bag?) Wait, no. Wait, hold on. Wait, initially, both Alice and Bob have the same set of balls: blue, green, orange, red, violet. So, their bags are identical in terms of contents. So, when Alice gives a ball to Bob, Bob's bag then has all the original five plus one more ball of the same color Alice gave. So, for example, if Alice gives a blue ball to Bob, Bob's bag will have blue, green, orange, red, violet, and another blue. Then, Bob picks a ball at random from his six-ball bag and gives it to Alice. For Alice to have all unique colors again, the ball she receives must be the same color she gave. In this case, if she gave blue, she needs to receive blue back. If she receives any other color, she would have two of that color and still have none of the color she gave. Wait, no. Wait, actually, no. Wait, Alice starts with all five colors. She gives one color to Bob. So, she is missing that color now. Then, if Bob gives her any ball except the one she gave, she would have four of her original colors plus a fifth different one. But since Bob's bag now has six balls: his original five plus the one Alice gave. So, if Bob gives her back a ball of the color she gave, then she will have her original four plus the one she gave. Wait, no. Wait, no, wait, let's clarify.
Let's say Alice has five balls: B, G, O, R, V. She picks one, say B, and gives it to Bob. Now, Alice's bag has G, O, R, V (only four balls). Bob's bag now has B, G, O, R, V, B (six balls). Then Bob picks a ball from his bag. If he picks B (one of the two Bs), then there's a probability of 2/6 = 1/3. If he picks G, O, R, or V (each has one), probability 1/6 each. If Bob gives back B, then Alice receives B and her bag becomes G, O, R, V, B – which is all five original colors. So she's back to where she started. If Bob gives her another color, say G, then Alice's bag would be G, O, R, V, G – which is duplicates of G and still missing B. So that's not good. Similarly, for Bob's bag. If Bob gave back B, then his bag is G, O, R, V, B (same as original). If he gave back G, his bag would have B, O, R, V, G – same as original. Wait, no. Wait, if Bob gives back G, then his bag, which was B, G, O, R, V, B, loses one G. So his bag becomes B, O, R, V, B. So duplicates of B and missing G. So that's different. Wait, so in order for both Alice and Bob to have the same contents as before, Bob must pick the same color that Alice gave him and return it. Then Alice's bag will have her original four plus the one she gave, and Bob's bag will have his original five minus the one he returned. Wait, but Bob's original five minus the one he returned? Wait, no, Bob's bag had his original five plus the one Alice gave. If he returns the same color Alice gave, then he's left with his original five. If he returns a different color, then he's left with original five minus the color he returned plus the one Alice gave. Hmmm.
Let's formalize this. Let’s denote the color Alice transfers to Bob as A. Then, Bob's bag has two balls of color A and all other colors once. Let the color Bob transfers back to Alice be B. After the transfers:
- Alice's bag contains {her original balls} - {A} + {B}
- Bob's bag contains {his original balls} + {A} - {B}
For both bags to have the same contents as they started with, we need Alice's bag to have all five original colors, which would require that B = A (so she loses A and regains A). Similarly, Bob's bag would have his original balls, plus A which is then removed by B = A. So, Bob's bag would be {original balls} + A - A = original balls. Thus, the only way for both to have the same contents is if the ball Bob gives back is the same as the ball Alice gave. Therefore, the probability should be equal to the probability that Alice gives a ball of some color, and then Bob picks a ball of that same color to return. Since Bob's bag, after receiving from Alice, has six balls: one color (the one Alice gave) is present twice, and the others are present once. The probability that Bob picks the same color is the number of balls of that color divided by six. Since Alice could have given any of the five colors with equal probability (1/5), but actually, since all colors are equally likely and the contents are the same, maybe we can compute the total probability as follows.
Alternatively, since Alice's transfer is uniformly random over five colors, and for each such color, Bob's probability of returning that same color is (the count of that color in his bag) / 6. Since Alice's transfer adds one ball of a certain color to Bob's bag, which originally had five different colors. So, Bob's bag after transfer has 6 balls, with one color (the transferred one) duplicated. Therefore, if Alice transferred color A, then Bob has 2 balls of color A and 1 each of the other colors. So, the probability that Bob selects color A is 2/6 = 1/3. If he selects any other color, it's 1/6 each. But since we need the probability that Bob selects the color Alice transferred, regardless of what that color is, then the total probability is calculated as follows: Since Alice's transfer is uniformly random over five colors, each color has a probability of 1/5. For each color Alice transfers, the probability that Bob returns that same color is 2/6 = 1/3. Wait, but hold on. Wait, is the probability dependent on the color Alice transferred? Wait, no. Because regardless of which color Alice transfers, Bob's bag will have two of that color, hence the probability that Bob picks that color is 1/3. So, for each color Alice transfers (with probability 1/5), Bob has a 1/3 chance of returning the same color. Therefore, the total probability is 5 * (1/5 * 1/3) = 1/3. Wait, that seems correct. Because there are five possible colors Alice could transfer. For each color, the combined probability is (1/5)*(1/3). But since there are five such colors, the total probability is 5*(1/5 *1/3) = 1/3. Wait, is that accurate? Let's verify. Alternatively, maybe we can consider the total probability space. The total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways Alice can transfer a ball multiplied by the number of ways Bob can transfer a ball. Since Alice has 5 choices, and then Bob has 6 choices, the total number is 5*6=30. The number of favorable outcomes is when Alice transfers a ball of color A, and Bob transfers back a ball of color A. For each color A, Alice can transfer color A in 1 way, and Bob can transfer color A in 2 ways (since he has two balls of that color after receiving from Alice). Therefore, for each color, there are 1*2 = 2 favorable outcomes. Since there are 5 colors, total favorable outcomes are 5*2 =10. Therefore, the probability is 10/(5*6) = 10/30 =1/3. Yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the probability that after the process the contents of the two bags are the same is 1/3. But let me verify once more to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Another way: The event we want is that the ball Bob returns is the same as the ball Alice gave. Let's model this as conditional probabilities. Let A be the color Alice transfers, and B the color Bob transfers back. Then, P(A = B) = sum_{color} P(A = color) * P(B = color | A = color). Since P(A = color) = 1/5 for each color, and P(B = color | A = color) = 2/6 = 1/3 because Bob has two of that color out of six balls. Therefore, the total probability is sum_{color} (1/5 * 1/3) = 5*(1/15) = 1/3. Correct. Alternatively, if we fix Alice's transfer, the probability for each case is the same. So, yes. Therefore, the answer is 1/3.
**Final Answer** 
\boxed{\dfrac{1}{3}}
</Think>

Answer: Alice and Bob each start with a bag containing one ball of each color: blue, green, orange, red, and violet. Alice randomly selects a ball from her bag and puts it into Bob's bag. Bob then randomly selects a ball from his bag (which now has six balls) and puts it into Alice's bag. We need to find the probability that the contents of both bags are the same after these transfers.

1. **Alice's Transfer**: Alice has 5 balls, each of a different color. She selects one ball uniformly at random and puts it into Bob's bag. This means each color has a probability of \( \frac{1}{5} \) of being transferred.

2. **Bob's Bag After Transfer**: Bob's bag now contains 6 balls: two balls of the color Alice transferred and one each of the other four colors.

3. **Bob's Transfer**: Bob selects a ball uniformly at random from his bag of 6 balls. For the contents of both bags to be the same as they originally were, Bob must return the ball of the same color that Alice transferred. The probability that Bob selects the correct color (which has 2 balls) is \( \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3} \).

4. **Total Probability**: Since the color Alice transfers is uniformly random, the total probability is calculated by considering each color. For each color, the probability that Alice transfers it is \( \frac{1}{5} \), and the probability that Bob returns the same color is \( \frac{1}{3} \). Summing these probabilities over all 5 colors gives:
   \[
   5 \times \left( \frac{1}{5} \times \frac{1}{3} \right) = \frac{1}{3}
   \]

Thus, the probability that the contents of the two bags are the same after the process is \(\boxed{\dfrac{1}{3}}\).

let's say alice has five balls: b, g, o, r, v. she picks one, say b, and gives it to bob. now, alice's bag has g, o, r, v (only four balls). bob's bag now has b, g, o, r, v, b (six balls). then bob picks a ball from his bag. if he picks b (one of the two bs), then there's a probability of 2/6 = 1/3. if he picks g, o, r, or v (each has one), probability 1/6 each. if bob gives back b, then alice receives b and her bag becomes g, o, r, v, b – which is all five original colors. so she's back to where she started. if bob gives her another color, say g, then alice's bag would be g, o, r, v, g – which is duplicates of g and still missing b. so that's not good. similarly, for bob's bag. if bob gave back b, then his bag is g, o, r, v, b (same as original). if he gave back g, his bag would have b, o, r, v, g – same as original. wait, no. wait, if bob gives back g, then his bag, which was b, g, o, r, v, b, loses one g. so his bag becomes b, o, r, v, b. so duplicates of b and missing g. so that's different. wait, so in order for both alice and bob to have the same contents as before, bob must pick the same color that alice gave him and return it. then alice's bag will have her original four plus the one she gave, and bob's bag will have his original five minus the one he returned. wait, but bob's original five minus the one he returned? wait, no, bob's bag had his original five plus the one alice gave. if he returns the same color alice gave, then he's left with his original five. if he returns a different color, then he's left with original five minus the color he returned plus the one alice gave. hmmm.
let's formalize this. let’s denote the color alice transfers to bob as a. then, bob's bag has two balls of color a and all other colors once. let the color bob transfers back to alice be b. after the transfers:
- alice's bag contains {her original balls} - {a} + {b}
- bob's bag contains {his original balls} + {a} - {b}
for both bags to have the same contents as they started with, we need alice's bag to have all five original colors, which would require that b = a (so she loses a and regains a). similarly, bob's bag would have his original balls, plus a which is then removed by b = a. so, bob's bag would be {original balls} + a - a = original balls. thus, the only way for both to have the same contents is if the ball bob gives back is the same as the ball alice gave. therefore, the probability should be equal to the probability that alice gives a ball of some color, and then bob picks a ball of that same color to return. since bob's bag, after receiving from alice, has six balls: one color (the one alice gave) is present twice, and the others are present once. the probability that bob picks the same color is the number of balls of that color divided by six. since alice could have given any of the five colors with equal probability (1/5), but actually, since all colors are equally likely and the contents are the same, maybe we can compute the total probability as follows.
alternatively, since alice's transfer is uniformly random over five colors, and for each such color, bob's probability of returning that same color is (the count of that color in his bag) / 6. since alice's transfer adds one ball of a certain color to bob's bag, which originally had five different colors. so, bob's bag after transfer has 6 balls, with one color (the transferred one) duplicated. therefore, if alice transferred color a, then bob has 2 balls of color a and 1 each of the other colors. so, the probability that bob selects color a is 2/6 = 1/3. if he selects any other color, it's 1/6 each. but since we need the probability that bob selects the color alice transferred, regardless of what that color is, then the total probability is calculated as follows: since alice's transfer is uniformly random over five colors, each color has a probability of 1/5. for each color alice transfers, the probability that bob returns that same color is 2/6 = 1/3. wait, but hold on. wait, is the probability dependent on the color alice transferred? wait, no. because regardless of which color alice transfers, bob's bag will have two of that color, hence the probability that bob picks that color is 1/3. so, for each color alice transfers (with probability 1/5), bob has a 1/3 chance of returning the same color. therefore, the total probability is 5 * (1/5 * 1/3) = 1/3. wait, that seems correct. because there are five possible colors alice could transfer. for each color, the combined probability is (1/5)*(1/3). but since there are five such colors, the total probability is 5*(1/5 *1/3) = 1/3. wait, is that accurate? let's verify. alternatively, maybe we can consider the total probability space. the total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways alice can transfer a ball multiplied by the number of ways bob can transfer a ball. since alice has 5 choices, and then bob has 6 choices, the total number is 5*6=30. the number of favorable outcomes is when alice transfers a ball of color a, and bob transfers back a ball of color a. for each color a, alice can transfer color a in 1 way, and bob can transfer color a in 2 ways (since he has two balls of that color after receiving from alice). therefore, for each color, there are 1*2 = 2 favorable outcomes. since there are 5 colors, total favorable outcomes are 5*2 =10. therefore, the probability is 10/(5*6) = 10/30 =1/3. yes, that seems correct. therefore, the probability that after the process the contents of the two bags are the same is 1/3. but let me verify once more to make sure i didn't make a mistake. another way: the event we want is that the ball bob returns is the same as the ball alice gave. let's model this as conditional probabilities. let a be the color alice transfers, and b the color bob transfers back. then, p(a = b) = sum_{color} p(a = color) * p(b = color | a = color). since p(a = color) = 1/5 for each color, and p(b = color | a = color) = 2/6 = 1/3 because bob has two of that color out of six balls. therefore, the total probability is sum_{color} (1/5 * 1/3) = 5*(1/15) = 1/3. correct. alternatively, if we fix alice's transfer, the probability for each case is the same. so, yes. therefore, the answer is 1/3.
**final answer** 
\boxed{\dfrac{1}{3}}

answer: alice and bob each start with a bag containing one ball of each color: blue, green, orange, red, and violet. alice randomly selects a ball from her bag and puts it into bob's bag. bob then randomly selects a ball from his bag (which now has six balls) and puts it into alice's bag. we need to find the probability that the contents of both bags are the same after these transfers.

1. **alice's transfer**: alice has 5 balls, each of a different color. she selects one ball uniformly at random and puts it into bob's bag. this means each color has a probability of \( \frac{1}{5} \) of being transferred.

2. **bob's bag after transfer**: bob's bag now contains 6 balls: two balls of the color alice transferred and one each of the other four colors.

3. **bob's transfer**: bob selects a ball uniformly at random from his bag of 6 balls. for the contents of both bags to be the same as they originally were, bob must return the ball of the same color that alice transferred. the probability that bob selects the correct color (which has 2 balls) is \( \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3} \).

4. **total probability**: since the color alice transfers is uniformly random, the total probability is calculated by considering each color. for each color, the probability that alice transfers it is \( \frac{1}{5} \), and the probability that bob returns the same color is \( \frac{1}{3} \). summing these probabilities over all 5 colors gives:
   \[
   5 \times \left( \frac{1}{5} \times \frac{1}{3} \right) = \frac{1}{3}
   \]

thus, the probability that the contents of the two bags are the same after the process is \(\boxed{\dfrac{1}{3}}\)
