Okay, so the problem is: The product of a set of distinct positive integers is 84.
What is the least possible sum of these integers?
Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.
First, I need to find all the distinct positive integers that multiply together to give 84.
Then, I have to find the combination of such integers that gives the least possible sum.
The key here is that the integers must be distinct, right?
So we can't repeat any numbers.
Let me start by factorizing 84.
Let's think in parallel.

1: The prime factorization of 84 is determined by dividing 84 by 2, yielding 42. Dividing 42 by 2 gives 21. Dividing 21 by 3 gives 7, which is a prime number. Consequently, the prime factors of 84 are 2, 2, 3, and 7.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The distinct positive integer sets whose product is 84 are identified. These include sets of one integer (84 itself), sets of two integers (1x84, 2x42, 3x28, 4x21, 6x14, 7x12), sets of three integers (1x2x42, 1x3x28, 1x4x21, 1x6x14, 1x7x12, 2x3x14, 2x6x7, 3x4x7), and sets of four integers (1x2x3x14, 1x2x6x7, 1x3x4x7, 2x3x4x7). The set {2,3,4,7} is noted as a possible four-integer combination.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The prime factors of 84 are 2, 2, 3, and 7. All distinct sets of positive integers whose product is 84 are identified, including {84}, {1,84}, {2,42}, {3,28}, {4,21}, {6,14}, {7,12}, {1,2,42}, {1,3,28}, {1,4,21}, {1,6,14}, {1,7,12}, {2,3,14}, {2,6,7}, {3,4,7}, {1,2,3,14}, {1,2,6,7}, {1,3,4,7}, and {2,3,4,7}.

1: The existence of a combination of three integers, distinct and with a product of 84, that yields a sum less than 14 is considered. A check of the sums of all distinct integer triples with a product of 84 is performed.

2: The sum of the set {2,3,4,7} is 16, which is greater than 14. The sum of the set {1,2,6,7} is 16, which is greater than 14. The sum of the set {1,3,4,7} is 15, which is greater than 14. The sum of the set {1,2,3,14} is 20, which is greater than 14. Therefore, no combination of four distinct integers whose product is 84 has a sum less than 14.

3: The possibility of a combination of five distinct integers, each greater than 1, whose product is 84 is considered. Since the prime factors of 84 are 2, 2, 3, and 7, and the requirement is for distinct integers, the number of distinct integers in such a combination would be at least five. The prime factors are 2, 2, 3, and 7, which can be considered as four factors. To form five distinct integers, these factors would need to be grouped and combined in a way that produces five distinct numbers. This is not straightforward. If 84 is expressed as a product of five distinct integers, these integers must include the prime factors 2, 3, and 7, as well as other factors. The prime factorization 2 * 2 * 3 * 7 allows for the combination of these factors into distinct integers. A potential five-integer combination could be 2, 3, 7, 2, and 1, but the integers must be distinct. Since 1 is not a prime factor, including it would require that the remaining factors multiply to 84. The integer 1 could be included if the other integers multiply to 84. For example, the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 7} is considered, where 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 7 = 168, which is not equal to 84. This combination does not work. Another set is {1, 2, 3, 6, 7}, which multiplies to 252, also not equal to 84. The set {1, 2, 3, 14} multiplies to 84, but it contains only four integers. The set {1, 2, 6, 7} also contains four integers. The set {1, 3, 4, 7} contains four integers. The set {2, 3, 4, 7} contains four integers. It is not possible to express 84 as the product of five distinct positive integers. Therefore, the minimum number of integers required is four. The set {2, 3, 4, 7} is a four-integer combination whose sum is 16. The set {1, 2, 6, 7} is another four-integer combination with a sum of 16. The set {1, 3, 4, 7} has a sum of 15. The set {1, 2, 3, 14} has a sum of 20. The set {1, 3, 4, 7} with a sum of 15 is identified as the four-integer combination with the smallest sum. A check is performed to confirm if there is a four-integer combination with a sum less than 15. The set {1, 2, 6, 7} sums to 16. The set {2, 3, 4, 7} sums to 16. The set {1, 2, 3, 14} sums to 20. The sum of 15 from {1, 3, 4, 7} is indeed the smallest for four-integer combinations.
The set {1, 3, 4, 7} is considered. The sum of its elements is 15. This sum is compared to the previously identified minimum sum of 14 from a two-integer combination. The sum 15 is greater than 14. The set {1, 3, 4, 7} is not considered for a lower sum because the two-integer combination {3,4,7} is invalid (it contains three integers), and the two-integer sum of 14 is the overall minimum.
The set {1, 3, 4, 7} is a four-integer combination with a sum of 15. The two-integer combination {3,4,7} is invalid as it contains three integers. The two-integer sum of 14 is indeed the overall minimum. The sum 15 is greater than 14.
The sum 14 is the minimum possible sum.
The sum of 14 is achieved by the two-integer combination {3,4,7} (invalid, actually three integers) or {3,4,7} (still three integers). This seems to be a confusion.

<think>
okay, so the problem is: the product of a set of distinct positive integers is 84.
what is the least possible sum of these integers?
hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.
first, i need to find all the distinct positive integers that multiply together to give 84.
then, i have to find the combination of such integers that gives the least possible sum.
the key here is that the integers must be distinct, right?
so we can't repeat any numbers.
let me start by factorizing 84.
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>
<goal>
<outline>
1: determine the prime factors of 84.
</outline>
<outline>
2: determine all distinct sets of positive integers whose product is 84.
</outline>
</goal>
<path>
1: the prime factorization of 84 is determined by dividing 84 by 2, yielding 42. dividing 42 by 2 gives 21. dividing 21 by 3 gives 7, which is a prime number. consequently, the prime factors of 84 are 2, 2, 3, and 7.
</path>
<path>
2: the distinct positive integer sets whose product is 84 are identified. these include sets of one integer (84 itself), sets of two integers (1x84, 2x42, 3x28, 4x21, 6x14, 7x12), sets of three integers (1x2x42, 1x3x28, 1x4x21, 1x6x14, 1x7x12, 2x3x14, 2x6x7, 3x4x7), and sets of four integers (1x2x3x14, 1x2x6x7, 1x3x4x7, 2x3x4x7). the set {2,3,4,7} is noted as a possible four-integer combination.
</path>
<conclusion>
the prime factors of 84 are 2, 2, 3, and 7. all distinct sets of positive integers whose product is 84 are identified, including {84}, {1,84}, {2,42}, {3,28}, {4,21}, {6,14}, {7,12}, {1,2,42}, {1,3,28}, {1,4,21}, {1,6,14}, {1,7,12}, {2,3,14}, {2,6,7}, {3,4,7}, {1,2,3,14}, {1,2,6,7}, {1,3,4,7}, and {2,3,4,7}.

2: the sum of the set {2,3,4,7} is 16, which is greater than 14. the sum of the set {1,2,6,7} is 16, which is greater than 14. the sum of the set {1,3,4,7} is 15, which is greater than 14. the sum of the set {1,2,3,14} is 20, which is greater than 14. therefore, no combination of four distinct integers whose product is 84 has a sum less than 14.

3: the possibility of a combination of five distinct integers, each greater than 1, whose product is 84 is considered. since the prime factors of 84 are 2, 2, 3, and 7, and the requirement is for distinct integers, the number of distinct integers in such a combination would be at least five. the prime factors are 2, 2, 3, and 7, which can be considered as four factors. to form five distinct integers, these factors would need to be grouped and combined in a way that produces five distinct numbers. this is not straightforward. if 84 is expressed as a product of five distinct integers, these integers must include the prime factors 2, 3, and 7, as well as other factors. the prime factorization 2 * 2 * 3 * 7 allows for the combination of these factors into distinct integers. a potential five-integer combination could be 2, 3, 7, 2, and 1, but the integers must be distinct. since 1 is not a prime factor, including it would require that the remaining factors multiply to 84. the integer 1 could be included if the other integers multiply to 84. for example, the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 7} is considered, where 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 7 = 168, which is not equal to 84. this combination does not work. another set is {1, 2, 3, 6, 7}, which multiplies to 252, also not equal to 84. the set {1, 2, 3, 14} multiplies to 84, but it contains only four integers. the set {1, 2, 6, 7} also contains four integers. the set {1, 3, 4, 7} contains four integers. the set {2, 3, 4, 7} contains four integers. it is not possible to express 84 as the product of five distinct positive integers. therefore, the minimum number of integers required is four. the set {2, 3, 4, 7} is a four-integer combination whose sum is 16. the set {1, 2, 6, 7} is another four-integer combination with a sum of 16. the set {1, 3, 4, 7} has a sum of 15. the set {1, 2, 3, 14} has a sum of 20. the set {1, 3, 4, 7} with a sum of 15 is identified as the four-integer combination with the smallest sum. a check is performed to confirm if there is a four-integer combination with a sum less than 15. the set {1, 2, 6, 7} sums to 16. the set {2, 3, 4, 7} sums to 16. the set {1, 2, 3, 14} sums to 20. the sum of 15 from {1, 3, 4, 7} is indeed the smallest for four-integer combinations.
the set {1, 3, 4, 7} is considered. the sum of its elements is 15. this sum is compared to the previously identified minimum sum of 14 from a two-integer combination. the sum 15 is greater than 14. the set {1, 3, 4, 7} is not considered for a lower sum because the two-integer combination {3,4,7} is invalid (it contains three integers), and the two-integer sum of 14 is the overall minimum.
the set {1, 3, 4, 7} is a four-integer combination with a sum of 15. the two-integer combination {3,4,7} is invalid as it contains three integers. the two-integer sum of 14 is indeed the overall minimum. the sum 15 is greater than 14.
the sum 14 is the minimum possible sum.
the sum of 14 is achieved by the two-integer combination {3,4,7} (invalid, actually three integers) or {3,4,7} (still three integers). this seems to be a confusion.
