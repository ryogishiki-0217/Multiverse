Okay, so I need to solve this problem: Find the least possible sum of a set of distinct positive integers whose product is 84.
Hmm, let me think.
First, I remember that to minimize the sum of numbers with a fixed product, the numbers should be as close to each other as possible.
I think that's something to do with the arithmetic mean-geometric mean inequality, but I might be mixing something up.
Wait, actually, AM ≥ GM, so equality holds when all numbers are equal.
But since we're dealing with distinct positive integers, they can't all be equal, but maybe they should be close?
Alternatively, maybe I need to factorize 84 into distinct factors and then add them up.
Let's start by factorizing 84.
The prime factorization of 84 is 2 × 2 × 3 × 7.
So, those are the prime factors.
But since we need distinct integers, we can't use the same number twice.
So, the factors here are 2, 2, 3, 7.
But duplicates aren't allowed.
So, two of the 2s need to be combined or something.
Wait, maybe I can use 4 (which is 2×2) instead of using two 2s.
So, then the factors would be 4, 3, and 7.

Wait, but 3, 4, 7: sum 14.
That's the same as the original 4, 3, 7.
But if we split further, maybe we can get a lower sum?
Wait, 14 is the product.
Wait, but 3×4×7 is 84, sum 14.
If we split 4 into 2×2, then it's 2, 2, 3, 7, sum 14, but numbers have to be distinct.
So, duplicates not allowed.
So, 2, 2, 3, 7 is invalid.
Alternatively, maybe use three factors: 2, 3, and 14.
Wait, 2×3×14=84.
Sum is 19.
Alternatively, 2, 6, 7.
Let's check: 2×6×7=84.
Sum is 15.
Is that the least?
Wait, but earlier, when I thought of 1, 6, 14, that's sum 21.
That's higher.
1, 2, 3, 14: sum 20.
But 2, 6, 7: sum 15.
Let's see.
Alternatively, 1, 3, 4, 7: sum 15.
Wait, same as 2, 6, 7.
So, 1+3+4+7=15.
Hmm, so both are sum 15.
Wait, but 15 is lower than 19, 20, 21.
But can we do better?

Wait, but 3, 4, 7 are distinct, sum 14.
Is that allowed?
Yes, because 3, 4, 7—distinct, positive integers.
Their product is 84.
So that's one possibility.
Then the sum is 14.
Alternatively, if we can split further.
Wait, but we can't split 3, 4, or 7 further without using 1s or duplicates.
Wait, for example, 3 can be split into 1×3, but that adds a 1 and keeps a 3.
Then the numbers would be 1, 3, 4, 7, sum 15.
Which is worse.
Similarly, 4 can be split into 2×2, but those are duplicates.
So invalid.
Alternatively, split 4 into 1×4: adds a 1, which increases the sum.
Similarly, 7 can only be split into 1×7, which again adds a 1.
So, splitting factors introduces 1s, which might increase the sum.
Wait, unless there's a way to split into more factors without introducing 1s.
For example, 6 can be split into 2×3.
But do we have a 6 in the factor?
Wait, in the factorization, prime factors are 2, 2, 3, 7.
So, composite factors could be 4, 6, 12, etc.
Wait, 84 divided by 4 is 21.
So 4×21 is also a factorization.
21 is 3×7.
So 4, 3, 7.
That's the original.
Alternatively, 84 can be factored into 6×14.
6 is 2×3, 14 is 2×7.
So that's 6, 14.
Then the factors are 6 and 14, with the rest being?
Wait, 84 = 6×14.
But 6×14 is 84.
So if I use 6 and 14, the numbers would be 6 and 14, but their product is 84, so that's two numbers.
But 6×14 is 84, but 6 and 14 multiply to 84.
So that's a valid set.
Sum would be 6 + 14 = 20.
Not better.
Alternatively, 84 can be written as 1×84, sum 85, which is worse.
So, splitting 84 into more factors would get a lower sum.
So the minimal sum would be 14, from 3, 4, 7.

Wait, but can we split 84 into more factors?
For example, 84 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 7, which is four factors, but two of them are duplicates.
If we need distinct, perhaps group some of them.
Wait, for instance, 2 × 3 = 6, so 6 × 2 × 7.
But the two is duplicated.
So that's not allowed.
Alternatively, 2 × (2×3) × 7 = 2×6×7.
But there's two 2s here.
Wait, no, in that case, 2 is once, 6 is once, 7 is once.
Wait, but 6 is 2×3, so in total, it's prime factors 2, 2, 3, 7.
But in terms of the actual numbers in the set, if the set is 2, 6, 7, they are distinct.
So that's a valid set.
So that sum is 15.
Wait, but earlier, when factoring as 3, 4, 7, which are also distinct, sum is 14.
Wait, so which one is better?
Wait, 3, 4, 7 gives sum 14.
2, 6, 7 gives sum 15.
So 14 is less.
Then, is 14 the minimal?
Let me check if there's another combination with four numbers.
For example, 1, 2, 12, 7.
1 × 2 × 12 × 7 = 1 × 2 = 2, times 12 = 24, times 7 = 168.
Oh, that's too much.
Not 84.

Wait, but 1, 3, 4, 7: sum 15.
That's worse than 14.
Alternatively, 1, 2, 3, 14: sum 20.
Worse.
1, 2, 4, 21: sum 28.
Even worse.
Alternatively, 1, 2, 7, 6: sum 16.
Wait, but that's same as 2, 6, 7 with an extra 1.
Wait, no, 1, 2, 6, 7.
Product 1×2×6×7=84.
Sum 16.
But 2, 6, 7 is sum 15.
Adding 1 makes it 16, which is higher.
So, no.
So, 3, 4, 7 is sum 14.
Let's see if there's another combination with different numbers.
For example, 5 is not a factor of 84, so can't use 5.
8 is not a factor of 84.
Wait, unless combine with others.
Wait, 84 divided by 3 is 28.
So 3 and 28.
Then 28 can be factored into 4×7, so 3,4,7.
Which is the same as before.
Alternatively, 28 as 2×14.
Then 2, 3, 14.
Sum 19.
Wait, but 2, 3, 14: sum 19.
Not better.
Alternatively, 84 = 12 × 7.
Then 12 and 7.
Sum 19.
Not better.
Alternatively, 84 = 21 × 4.
Then 21 and 4.
Sum 25.
Worse.
Alternatively, 84 = 8 × ?.
84 divided by 8 is 10.5, which is not integer.
So no.
So, seems like the minimal sum is 14.
But let me check once again if there's a way to express 84 as a product involving smaller numbers.
Wait, what about using three 2s?
But original prime factors are two 2s.
So maybe if we split one of the 2s into something else.
But 2's prime factors are just 2.
So no.
Alternatively, use exponents?
Not sure.
Wait, another approach: The function we need to minimize is the sum of numbers, given their product is fixed.
To minimize the sum, the numbers should be as small as possible, but all distinct.
So, start with the smallest distinct positive integers and try to multiply up to 84.
Let's see:
The smallest distinct positive integers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc.
Let's see how far we need to go to multiply to 84.
1×2×3×4×...?
1×2×3×4 = 24.
Still low.
1×2×3×4×5 = 120.
That's over 84.
So, need to find a subset of consecutive integers starting from 1 whose product is 84.
But 1×2×3×4×7 = 1×2×3×4×7 = 168.
Too much.
1×2×3×7 = 42.
Then multiply by 2: 42×2 = 84.
But numbers can't be repeated.
So, 1,2,3,7,2 is invalid.
Wait, maybe non-consecutive.
For example, 1, 3, 4, 7.
Product: 1×3×4×7=84.
Sum:1+3+4+7=15.
Earlier, that's an option.
Alternatively, 1, 2, 6, 7.
Product: 1×2×6×7=84, sum:16.
Alternatively, 1, 2, 3, 14.
Product: 84, sum:20.
Alternatively, 1, 4, 21.
Product: 84, sum:26.
Alternatively, 1, 5, 12.
Product: 60.
Not 84.
Wait, so maybe the minimal sum using four numbers is 15 (1,3,4,7).
But we also have the three-number sum: 14 (3,4,7).
Wait, but in that case, are numbers distinct?
Yes, 3,4,7.
So, sum is 14.
Is this allowed?
Yes.
Because the problem states "a set of distinct positive integers".
So, as long as they're distinct, the count doesn't matter.
So, if 3,4,7 gives product 84 and sum 14, that's okay.
But wait, can we do even better, i.e., sum less than 14?

Wait, let's check: 3×4×7=84.
Yes.
So sum is 3+4+7=14.
Is this the minimal?
Let me see.
If we use two numbers, can we have two distinct numbers multiplying to 84?
For example, 12 ×7=84, sum=19.
Or 1×84=84, sum=85.
Not better.
2×42=84, sum=44.
Etc.
So three numbers give a lower sum.
What about five numbers?
For example, 1×2×3×4×7=168.
Too big.
Need to adjust.
Maybe 1×2×3× something else.
Wait, 84 divided by 1×2×3=6 is 14.
So 1×2×3×14=84.
Sum=1+2+3+14=20.
Alternatively, split 14 into 2×7, but that would be 1×2×3×2×7, but duplicates.
Alternatively, 1×2×3× something smaller?
Wait, 1×2×3×4=24.
Then need 84÷24=3.5, not integer.
So no.
Alternatively, 1×2×3×5=30.
84÷30=2.8.
Not integer.
1×2×3×6=36.
84÷36=2.333... Not integer.
1×2×3×7=42.
84÷42=2.
But then numbers would be 1,2,3,7,2, which has duplicates.
So invalid.
So, five numbers have to include 1,2,3,7,2, but duplicates, which is invalid.
So, next possibility is 1,2, something else.
Hmm.
Alternatively, 1, 2, 4, ?, since 84 divided by 1×2×4=8 is 10.5.
Not integer.
1, 2, 5, ?.
84/(1×2×5)=84/10=8.4.
Not integer.
1,3,4,?.
84/(1×3×4)=84/12=7.
So 1,3,4,7.
Product 84.
Sum 15.
Which we already found.
Alternatively, 2,3,4,?.
84/24=3.5.
Not integer.
So, seems like 1,3,4,7 is the only four-number combination.
Wait, check 1,2,6,7.
Product 1×2×6×7=84.
Sum 16.
So, 15 is better.
Alternatively, 1, 2, 3, 14.
Sum 20.
As before.
So, seems like the minimal sum with three numbers is 14 (3,4,7) and with four numbers is 15 (1,3,4,7).
So 14 is lower.
Therefore, the minimal sum is 14.
But wait, are there other three-number combinations besides 3,4,7?
Let's check.

3,4,7: sum 14.
Let's see:
Check all possible triplets:
Possible triplets (a,b,c) such that a×b×c=84, distinct positive integers.
Let's list them in order:
Start with the smallest possible a, then b, then c.
Let a < b < c.
Start with a=1:
Then b×c=84.
Possible (b,c) pairs:
Since b < c, and b > a=1.
So b can be from 2 to floor(sqrt(84))=9.
Check b=2: c=42.
So triplet (1,2,42).
Sum=45.
b=3: c=28.
Sum=1+3+28=32.
b=4: c=21.
Sum=1+4+21=26.
b=5: c=16.8.
Not integer.
b=6: c=14.
So triplet (1,6,14).
Sum=21.
b=7: c=12.
Sum=1+7+12=20.
b=8: c=10.5.
No.
b=9: c=84/9=9.333.
No.
So the possible triplet sums for a=1 are:
(1,2,42):45
(1,3,28):32
(1,4,21):26
(1,6,14):21
(1,7,12):20
So the minimal sum when a=1 is 20+1=21?
Wait, (1,7,12): sum 20.
Wait, but 1+7+12=20.
So 20.
That's better than the others with a=1.
But still higher than 14.
Next, a=2:
Then b×c=42.
Since a=2, b must be >2.
So b starts at 3.
Possible (b,c):
b=3: c=14.
Sum=2+3+14=19.
b=4: c=10.5.
No.
b=5: c=8.4.
No.
b=6: c=7.
So triplet (2,6,7).
Sum=15.
b=7: c=6.
But b=7 is greater than c=6, so stop.
So possible triplets for a=2:
(2,3,14): sum=19
(2,6,7): sum=15
So minimal sum here is 15.
Now a=3:
Then b×c=28.
Since a=3, b must be >3.
Possible (b,c):
b=4: c=7.
Sum=3+4+7=14.
b=5: c=5.6.
No.
b=6: c≈4.666.
No.
So triplet (3,4,7) with sum=14.
That's the same as found earlier.
a=4:
Then b×c=21.
Since a=4, b >4.
So possible (b,c):
b=5: c=4.2.
No.
b=6: c=3.5.
No.
b=7: c=3.
But 7×3=21, but b=7 > c=3, which is invalid.
So no triplet here.
a=5:
84/5=16.8.
Not integer.
So no.
Similarly, a=6:
84/6=14.
So possible triplet (6, something, something).
But 6×b×c=84 ⇒ b×c=14.
b=7, c=2.
But b=7 > c=2, invalid.
So, triplet (6,7,2) but not in order.
So no.
So the only possible triplet with a=3 is sum 14.
Similarly, a=3, triplet (3,4,7).
So that's the only triplet that gives sum 14.
So seems like that's the minimal.
Any other triplets?
For example, a=2, b=6, c=7.
Sum=15.
So sum 15 is higher.
When a=3, the sum is 14.
If we go to a=4, no valid triplets.
So, seems like (3,4,7) is the only triplet with sum 14.
Are there other ways to get sum lower than 14?
Let's see.
What about numbers not in triplet?
For example, using four numbers: is there a combination of four distinct numbers with product 84 and sum <14?
Let's see.
Possible four-number combinations:
As before:
1,3,4,7: sum=15.
1,2,6,7: sum=16.
1,2, something else, maybe.
Let's think: For example, 1, 2, 3, but then 84/ (1×2×3)=14.
So 1,2,3,14.
Sum=1+2+3+14=20.
Alternatively, 1,2, 4, 84/8=10.5.
Not integer.
So no.
1,2,5, 84/(1×2×5)=8.4.
No.
1,2, 5, can't.
1,3,4,7 as before.
So, sum 15.
All other four-number combinations will have higher sums because we have to use larger numbers.
For example, 1, 5, 6, 84/(5×6)=84/30=2.8.
Not integer.
So, no.
So, four numbers can't give a sum less than 15, which is higher than 14.
Similarly, five numbers would definitely need even smaller numbers, but since the base numbers are 1,2,3,4,5, etc., multiplying more numbers means the product is less, so to reach 84, you need bigger numbers, which might increase the sum.
For example, 1×2×3×4×...?
As before, 1×2×3×4=24.
Then you need another factor of 84/24=3.5, not integer.
So, not possible.
Alternatively, 1×2×3× something else.
But 1×2×3× something×something=84.
So 6× something×something=84.
So the remaining factors must multiply to 14.
So 1×2×3×(2×7).
But 2 is duplicated.
So invalid.
If we represent 14 as 1×14, then numbers would be 1,2,3,1,14.
Duplicates and more than four numbers.
Not allowed.
Alternatively, 1×2×3×(1×14).
Same problem.
So, perhaps impossible to have five distinct numbers.
Similarly, more numbers would need even

solve the following math problem: the product of a set of distinct positive integers is 84. what is the least possible sum of these integers?
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
<think>
okay, so i need to solve this problem: find the least possible sum of a set of distinct positive integers whose product is 84.
hmm, let me think.
first, i remember that to minimize the sum of numbers with a fixed product, the numbers should be as close to each other as possible.
i think that's something to do with the arithmetic mean-geometric mean inequality, but i might be mixing something up.
wait, actually, am ≥ gm, so equality holds when all numbers are equal.
but since we're dealing with distinct positive integers, they can't all be equal, but maybe they should be close?
alternatively, maybe i need to factorize 84 into distinct factors and then add them up.
let's start by factorizing 84.
the prime factorization of 84 is 2 × 2 × 3 × 7.
so, those are the prime factors.
but since we need distinct integers, we can't use the same number twice.
so, the factors here are 2, 2, 3, 7.
but duplicates aren't allowed.
so, two of the 2s need to be combined or something.
wait, maybe i can use 4 (which is 2×2) instead of using two 2s.
so, then the factors would be 4, 3, and 7.

wait, but 3, 4, 7: sum 14.
that's the same as the original 4, 3, 7.
but if we split further, maybe we can get a lower sum?
wait, 14 is the product.
wait, but 3×4×7 is 84, sum 14.
if we split 4 into 2×2, then it's 2, 2, 3, 7, sum 14, but numbers have to be distinct.

wait, but 3, 4, 7 are distinct, sum 14.
is that allowed?
yes, because 3, 4, 7—distinct, positive integers.
their product is 84.
so that's one possibility.
then the sum is 14.
alternatively, if we can split further.
wait, but we can't split 3, 4, or 7 further without using 1s or duplicates.
wait, for example, 3 can be split into 1×3, but that adds a 1 and keeps a 3.
then the numbers would be 1, 3, 4, 7, sum 15.
which is worse.
similarly, 4 can be split into 2×2, but those are duplicates.
so invalid.
alternatively, split 4 into 1×4: adds a 1, which increases the sum.
similarly, 7 can only be split into 1×7, which again adds a 1.
so, splitting factors introduces 1s, which might increase the sum.
wait, unless there's a way to split into more factors without introducing 1s.
for example, 6 can be split into 2×3.
but do we have a 6 in the factor?
wait, in the factorization, prime factors are 2, 2, 3, 7.
so, composite factors could be 4, 6, 12, etc.
wait, 84 divided by 4 is 21.
so 4×21 is also a factorization.
21 is 3×7.
so 4, 3, 7.
that's the original.
alternatively, 84 can be factored into 6×14.
6 is 2×3, 14 is 2×7.
so that's 6, 14.
then the factors are 6 and 14, with the rest being?
wait, 84 = 6×14.
but 6×14 is 84.
so if i use 6 and 14, the numbers would be 6 and 14, but their product is 84, so that's two numbers.
but 6×14 is 84, but 6 and 14 multiply to 84.
so that's a valid set.
sum would be 6 + 14 = 20.
not better.
alternatively, 84 can be written as 1×84, sum 85, which is worse.
so, splitting 84 into more factors would get a lower sum.
so the minimal sum would be 14, from 3, 4, 7.

wait, but can we split 84 into more factors?
for example, 84 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 7, which is four factors, but two of them are duplicates.
if we need distinct, perhaps group some of them.
wait, for instance, 2 × 3 = 6, so 6 × 2 × 7.
but the two is duplicated.
so that's not allowed.
alternatively, 2 × (2×3) × 7 = 2×6×7.
but there's two 2s here.
wait, no, in that case, 2 is once, 6 is once, 7 is once.
wait, but 6 is 2×3, so in total, it's prime factors 2, 2, 3, 7.
but in terms of the actual numbers in the set, if the set is 2, 6, 7, they are distinct.
so that's a valid set.
so that sum is 15.
wait, but earlier, when factoring as 3, 4, 7, which are also distinct, sum is 14.
wait, so which one is better?
wait, 3, 4, 7 gives sum 14.
2, 6, 7 gives sum 15.
so 14 is less.
then, is 14 the minimal?
let me check if there's another combination with four numbers.
for example, 1, 2, 12, 7.
1 × 2 × 12 × 7 = 1 × 2 = 2, times 12 = 24, times 7 = 168.
oh, that's too much.
not 84.

wait, but 1, 3, 4, 7: sum 15.
that's worse than 14.
alternatively, 1, 2, 3, 14: sum 20.
worse.
1, 2, 4, 21: sum 28.
even worse.
alternatively, 1, 2, 7, 6: sum 16.
wait, but that's same as 2, 6, 7 with an extra 1.
wait, no, 1, 2, 6, 7.
product 1×2×6×7=84.
sum 16.
but 2, 6, 7 is sum 15.
adding 1 makes it 16, which is higher.
so, no.
so, 3, 4, 7 is sum 14.
let's see if there's another combination with different numbers.
for example, 5 is not a factor of 84, so can't use 5.
8 is not a factor of 84.
wait, unless combine with others.
wait, 84 divided by 3 is 28.
so 3 and 28.
then 28 can be factored into 4×7, so 3,4,7.
which is the same as before.
alternatively, 28 as 2×14.
then 2, 3, 14.
sum 19.
wait, but 2, 3, 14: sum 19.
not better.
alternatively, 84 = 12 × 7.
then 12 and 7.
sum 19.
not better.
alternatively, 84 = 21 × 4.
then 21 and 4.
sum 25.
worse.
alternatively, 84 = 8 × ?.
84 divided by 8 is 10.5, which is not integer.
so no.
so, seems like the minimal sum is 14.
but let me check once again if there's a way to express 84 as a product involving smaller numbers.
wait, what about using three 2s?
but original prime factors are two 2s.
so maybe if we split one of the 2s into something else.
but 2's prime factors are just 2.
so no.
alternatively, use exponents?
not sure.
wait, another approach: the function we need to minimize is the sum of numbers, given their product is fixed.
to minimize the sum, the numbers should be as small as possible, but all distinct.
so, start with the smallest distinct positive integers and try to multiply up to 84.
let's see:
the smallest distinct positive integers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc.
let's see how far we need to go to multiply to 84.
1×2×3×4×...?
1×2×3×4 = 24.
still low.
1×2×3×4×5 = 120.
that's over 84.
so, need to find a subset of consecutive integers starting from 1 whose product is 84.
but 1×2×3×4×7 = 1×2×3×4×7 = 168.
too much.
1×2×3×7 = 42.
then multiply by 2: 42×2 = 84.
but numbers can't be repeated.
so, 1,2,3,7,2 is invalid.
wait, maybe non-consecutive.
for example, 1, 3, 4, 7.
product: 1×3×4×7=84.
sum:1+3+4+7=15.
earlier, that's an option.
alternatively, 1, 2, 6, 7.
product: 1×2×6×7=84, sum:16.
alternatively, 1, 2, 3, 14.
product: 84, sum:20.
alternatively, 1, 4, 21.
product: 84, sum:26.
alternatively, 1, 5, 12.
product: 60.
not 84.
wait, so maybe the minimal sum using four numbers is 15 (1,3,4,7).
but we also have the three-number sum: 14 (3,4,7).
wait, but in that case, are numbers distinct?
yes, 3,4,7.
so, sum is 14.
is this allowed?
yes.
because the problem states "a set of distinct positive integers".
so, as long as they're distinct, the count doesn't matter.
so, if 3,4,7 gives product 84 and sum 14, that's okay.
but wait, can we do even better, i.e., sum less than 14?

wait, let's check: 3×4×7=84.
yes.
so sum is 3+4+7=14.
is this the minimal?
let me see.
if we use two numbers, can we have two distinct numbers multiplying to 84?
for example, 12 ×7=84, sum=19.
or 1×84=84, sum=85.
not better.
2×42=84, sum=44.
etc.
so three numbers give a lower sum.
what about five numbers?
for example, 1×2×3×4×7=168.
too big.
need to adjust.
maybe 1×2×3× something else.
wait, 84 divided by 1×2×3=6 is 14.
so 1×2×3×14=84.
sum=1+2+3+14=20.
alternatively, split 14 into 2×7, but that would be 1×2×3×2×7, but duplicates.
alternatively, 1×2×3× something smaller?
wait, 1×2×3×4=24.
then need 84÷24=3.5, not integer.
so no.
alternatively, 1×2×3×5=30.
84÷30=2.8.
not integer.
1×2×3×6=36.
84÷36=2.333... not integer.
1×2×3×7=42.
84÷42=2.
but then numbers would be 1,2,3,7,2, which has duplicates.
so invalid.
so, five numbers have to include 1,2,3,7,2, but duplicates, which is invalid.
so, next possibility is 1,2, something else.
hmm.
alternatively, 1, 2, 4, ?, since 84 divided by 1×2×4=8 is 10.5.
not integer.
1, 2, 5, ?.
84/(1×2×5)=84/10=8.4.
not integer.
1,3,4,?.
84/(1×3×4)=84/12=7.
so 1,3,4,7.
product 84.
sum 15.
which we already found.
alternatively, 2,3,4,?.
84/24=3.5.
not integer.
so, seems like 1,3,4,7 is the only four-number combination.
wait, check 1,2,6,7.
product 1×2×6×7=84.
sum 16.
so, 15 is better.
alternatively, 1, 2, 3, 14.
sum 20.
as before.
so, seems like the minimal sum with three numbers is 14 (3,4,7) and with four numbers is 15 (1,3,4,7).
so 14 is lower.
therefore, the minimal sum is 14.
but wait, are there other three-number combinations besides 3,4,7?

3,4,7: sum 14.
let's see:
check all possible triplets:
possible triplets (a,b,c) such that a×b×c=84, distinct positive integers.
let's list them in order:
start with the smallest possible a, then b, then c.
let a < b < c.
start with a=1:
then b×c=84.
possible (b,c) pairs:
since b < c, and b > a=1.
so b can be from 2 to floor(sqrt(84))=9.
check b=2: c=42.
so triplet (1,2,42).
sum=45.
b=3: c=28.
sum=1+3+28=32.
b=4: c=21.
sum=1+4+21=26.
b=5: c=16.8.
not integer.
b=6: c=14.
so triplet (1,6,14).
sum=21.
b=7: c=12.
sum=1+7+12=20.
b=8: c=10.5.
no.
b=9: c=84/9=9.333.
no.
so the possible triplet sums for a=1 are:
(1,2,42):45
(1,3,28):32
(1,4,21):26
(1,6,14):21
(1,7,12):20
so the minimal sum when a=1 is 20+1=21?
wait, (1,7,12): sum 20.
wait, but 1+7+12=20.
so 20.
that's better than the others with a=1.
but still higher than 14.
next, a=2:
then b×c=42.
since a=2, b must be >2.
so b starts at 3.
possible (b,c):
b=3: c=14.
sum=2+3+14=19.
b=4: c=10.5.
no.
b=5: c=8.4.
no.
b=6: c=7.
so triplet (2,6,7).
sum=15.
b=7: c=6.
but b=7 is greater than c=6, so stop.
so possible triplets for a=2:
(2,3,14): sum=19
(2,6,7): sum=15
so minimal sum here is 15.
now a=3:
then b×c=28.
since a=3, b must be >3.
possible (b,c):
b=4: c=7.
sum=3+4+7=14.
b=5: c=5.6.
no.
b=6: c≈4.666.
no.
so triplet (3,4,7) with sum=14.
that's the same as found earlier.
a=4:
then b×c=21.
since a=4, b >4.
so possible (b,c):
b=5: c=4.2.
no.
b=6: c=3.5.
no.
b=7: c=3.
but 7×3=21, but b=7 > c=3, which is invalid.
so no triplet here.
a=5:
84/5=16.8.
not integer.
so no.
similarly, a=6:
84/6=14.
so possible triplet (6, something, something).
but 6×b×c=84 ⇒ b×c=14.
b=7, c=2.
but b=7 > c=2, invalid.
so, triplet (6,7,2) but not in order.
so no.
so the only possible triplet with a=3 is sum 14.
similarly, a=3, triplet (3,4,7).
so that's the only triplet that gives sum 14.
so seems like that's the minimal.
any other triplets?
for example, a=2, b=6, c=7.
sum=15.
so sum 15 is higher.
when a=3, the sum is 14.
if we go to a=4, no valid triplets.
so, seems like (3,4,7) is the only triplet with sum 14.
are there other ways to get sum lower than 14?
let's see.
what about numbers not in triplet?
for example, using four numbers: is there a combination of four distinct numbers with product 84 and sum <14?
let's see.
possible four-number combinations:
as before:
1,3,4,7: sum=15.
1,2,6,7: sum=16.
1,2, something else, maybe.
let's think: for example, 1, 2, 3, but then 84/ (1×2×3)=14.
so 1,2,3,14.
sum=1+2+3+14=20.
alternatively, 1,2, 4, 84/8=10.5.
not integer.
so no.
1,2,5, 84/(1×2×5)=8.4.
no.
1,2, 5, can't.
1,3,4,7 as before.
so, sum 15.
all other four-number combinations will have higher sums because we have to use larger numbers.
for example, 1, 5, 6, 84/(5×6)=84/30=2.8.
not integer.
so, no.
so, four numbers can't give a sum less than 15, which is higher than 14.
similarly, five numbers would definitely need even smaller numbers, but since the base numbers are 1,2,3,4,5, etc., multiplying more numbers means the product is less, so to reach 84, you need bigger numbers, which might increase the sum.
for example, 1×2×3×4×...?
as before, 1×2×3×4=24.
then you need another factor of 84/24=3.5, not integer.
so, not possible.
alternatively, 1×2×3× something else.
but 1×2×3× something×something=84.
so 6× something×something=84.
so the remaining factors must multiply to 14.
so 1×2×3×(2×7).
but 2 is duplicated.
so invalid.
if we represent 14 as 1×14, then numbers would be 1,2,3,1,14.
duplicates and more than four numbers.
not allowed.
alternatively, 1×2×3×(1×14).
same problem.
so, perhaps impossible to have five distinct numbers.
similarly, more numbers would need even
