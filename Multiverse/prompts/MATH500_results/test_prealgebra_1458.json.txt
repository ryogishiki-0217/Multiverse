Okay, so the problem is asking, what is the fraction of 2 feet that is equal to 3 inches? And they want the answer as a common fraction. Hmm, let me think.
First, I need to make sure that both measurements are in the same units. I can either convert feet to inches or inches to feet. Maybe converting feet to inches is easier here. Let's see.
Let's think in parallel.

1: Determination of the total number of inches equivalent to 2 feet.

2: Determination of the fraction representing 3 inches of the total 24 inches.

1: 2 feet is converted to inches by multiplying by 12, resulting in 24 inches.
</Path>

2: The fraction representing 3 inches of the total 24 inches is 3/24. This fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3. The division of the numerator 3 by 3 yields 1. The division of the denominator 24 by 3 yields 8.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The conversion of 2 feet to inches yields 24 inches. The fraction representing 3 inches of this total is 3/24, which simplifies to 1/8.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So, the answer is 1/8. Let me check again. 2 feet is 24 inches. 3 inches over 24 inches equals 3/24 which reduces to 1/8. Yeah, that seems right. Just to make sure, another way: If 2 feet is the whole, then how much is 3 inches in terms of that whole? So, converting 2 feet to inches gives 24 inches. So the whole is 24 inches, the part is 3 inches, so the fraction is part over whole, which is 3/24=1/8. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 1/8.
**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{1}{8}}
</Think>

Answer: To solve the problem of finding the fraction of 2 feet that is equal to 3 inches, we need to express both measurements in the same units. 

First, we convert 2 feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we calculate:
\[
2 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 24 \text{ inches}
\]

Next, we need to find the fraction of 24 inches that 3 inches represents. This is done by dividing 3 inches by 24 inches:
\[
\frac{3 \text{ inches}}{24 \text{ inches}} = \frac{3}{24}
\]

We simplify the fraction \(\frac{3}{24}\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:
\[
\frac{3 \div 3}{24 \div 3} = \frac{1}{8}
\]

Thus, the fraction of 2 feet that is 3 inches is \(\frac{1}{8}\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{\dfrac{1}{8}}\).
