Okay, so I need to find the sum of the roots a, b, and c of the equation 1/x + 5x2 = 6x - 24. Hmm, first, I remember that for any polynomial equation, the sum of the roots can be found using Vieta's formulas. Specifically, for a cubic equation of the form x3 + px2 + qx + r = 0, the sum of the roots is -p. But let me check, the given equation isn't a polynomial yet because of the 1/x term. I need to manipulate the equation into a polynomial form, probably by multiplying both sides by x to eliminate the denominator.

1: The given equation 1/x + 5x2 = 6x - 24 is multiplied by x to eliminate the denominator. This multiplication yields 1 + 5x3 = 6x2 - 24x. The resulting equation is 1 + 5x3 = 6x2 - 24x.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The transformed equation 5x^3 - 6x^2 + 24x + 1 = 0 is compared to the standard cubic form x^3 + px^2 + qx + r = 0. To match the standard form, the equation is divided by the leading coefficient 5. This division yields x^3 - (6/5)x^2 + (24/5)x + 1/5 = 0. The coefficient of x^2 in this standard form is -6/5.
</Path>
<Path>
3: The sum of the roots of the polynomial 5x^3 - 6x^2 + 24x + 1 = 0 is found using Vieta's formula. For a cubic equation ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0, the sum of the roots is -b/a. Here, the coefficient 'a' of x^3 is 5, and the coefficient 'b' of x^2 is -6. The sum of the roots is therefore -(-6)/5, which simplifies to 6/5.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The equation 1/x + 5x^2 = 6x - 24 transforms to 5x^3 - 6x^2 + 24x + 1 = 0, and subsequently to its standard form x^3 - (6/5)x^2 + (24/5)x + 1/5 = 0. Applying Vieta's formula to this standard cubic form confirms the sum of the roots as 6/5.

Wait, but hold on. When we multiplied both sides by x, are there any extraneous solutions introduced? For instance, the original equation has a domain of all real numbers except x=0, but after multiplying by x, the polynomial equation has x=0 as a potential root. Let me check if x=0 is a root of the polynomial equation.

1: Substituting x=0 into the polynomial equation 5x^3 - 6x^2 + 24x + 1 = 0 results in 0 - 0 + 0 + 1 = 1, which is not equal to 0. This indicates that x=0 is not a root of the polynomial equation.
</Path>
<Path>
2: Substituting x=0 into the original equation 1/x + 5x^2 = 6x - 24 yields 1/0 + 0 = 0 - 24. The term 1/0 is undefined, which means x=0 is not a valid root for the original equation.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The substitution x=0 into the polynomial equation 5x^3 - 6x^2 + 24x + 1 = 0 results in 1 ≠ 0, confirming that x=0 is not a root. Consequently, x=0 cannot be a root of the original equation 1/x + 5x^2 = 6x - 24, as it would require division by zero.

So, multiplying by x doesn't introduce any extraneous roots here. Therefore, the roots of the original equation are exactly the roots of 5x3 - 6x2 + 24x + 1 = 0, excluding any roots that would make the original equation undefined (i.e., x=0). But since x=0 isn't a root of the polynomial, all roots of the polynomial are roots of the original equation. Therefore, the roots a, b, c are the roots of 5x3 - 6x2 +24x +1 = 0. Therefore, the sum is 6/5. Wait, but Vieta's formula: for the polynomial 5x3 -6x2 +24x +1, the sum of roots is -(-6)/5 = 6/5. Yes, that's correct. Therefore, a + b + c = 6/5. But just to double-check, let's suppose we didn't divide by 5. The polynomial is 5x3 -6x2 +24x +1. The formula for sum of roots is -b/a, where a is coefficient of x3 and b is coefficient of x2. So -(-6)/5 = 6/5. Same result. Alternatively, if the polynomial is written as x3 + px2 + qx + r, then sum of roots is -p. So if we divide the equation by 5 to make it x3 - (6/5)x2 + (24/5)x + 1/5 =0. Then p = -6/5, so sum of roots is -(-6/5) = 6/5. Yep, same answer.

the final answer is 6/5
</Think>

Answer: Given the equation \(\frac{1}{x} + 5x^2 = 6x - 24\), we need to compute the sum of the roots \(a + b + c\).

First, we eliminate the denominator by multiplying both sides by \(x\):
\[
1 + 5x^3 = 6x^2 - 24x
\]
Rearranging all terms to one side, we get the polynomial equation:
\[
5x^3 - 6x^2 + 24x + 1 = 0
\]

Next, we use Vieta's formulas to find the sum of the roots. For a cubic equation of the form \(Ax^3 + Bx^2 + Cx + D = 0\), the sum of the roots is given by \(-\frac{B}{A}\). Here, \(A = 5\) and \(B = -6\). Therefore, the sum of the roots is:
\[
-\frac{-6}{5} = \frac{6}{5}
\]

Thus, the sum of the roots \(a + b + c\) is \(\boxed{\frac{6}{5}}\).
