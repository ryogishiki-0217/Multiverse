Okay, so I need to find the sum of the roots a, b, and c of the equation 1/x + 5x2 = 6x - 24. Hmm, first, I remember that for any polynomial equation, the sum of the roots can often be found using Vieta's formulas. But looking at this equation, it's not currently a polynomial because it has a 1/x term. I guess my first step should be to convert this into a regular polynomial equation.
Let me think. How do I eliminate the denominator? The equation is 1/x + 5x2 = 6x - 24. If I multiply every term by x to eliminate the denominator, that should do it. Let's try:
Multiplying both sides by x:
1 + 5x3 = 6x2 - 24x
Okay, that simplifies to 5x3 - 6x2 + 24x + 1 = 0. Wait, let me check that order.
Left side: 1 + 5x3
Right side: 6x2 - 24x
So bringing all terms to the left side would be 5x3 - 6x2 + 24x + 1 = 0. Yes, that looks like a cubic polynomial. Now, that's a standard polynomial equation: 5x3 - 6x2 + 24x + 1 = 0. So the roots a, b, and c are the roots of this cubic. Then, using Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots should be related to the coefficients. For a cubic equation of the form ax3 + bx2 + cx + d = 0, the sum of the roots is equal to -b/a, right? But wait, let me confirm that. Let's recall Vieta's formulas for a cubic equation: If the roots are a, b, c, then: a + b + c = - (coefficient of x2)/(coefficient of x3) a b + a c + b c = (coefficient of x)/(coefficient of x3) a b c = - (constant term)/(coefficient of x3) So, in our equation, the cubic is 5x3 -6x2 +24x +1 = 0. So the coefficient a for x3 is 5, coefficient b for x2 is -6, coefficient c for x is 24, and the constant term d is 1. Therefore, the sum a + b + c is - (-6)/5 = 6/5. So is that correct? Wait, but hold on. Let me check again.
The original equation was 1/x +5x2 =6x -24. When I multiply both sides by x, I should get each term: 1 +5x3 =6x2 -24x. Then moving all terms to the left: 5x3 -6x2 +24x +1 =0. Correct. So yes, cubic equation: 5x3 -6x2 +24x +1 =0. Then, according to Vieta, the sum of roots is -(-6)/5 = 6/5. So 6/5. But wait, the answer seems straightforward. Is there a trick here? Because sometimes when you manipulate equations, like multiplying by x, you have to check if any roots are introduced or lost. For example, multiplying by x, if x were zero, but since original equation has 1/x, x cannot be zero. So, x=0 is not a root of the original equation, so we're okay. Also, when multiplying by x, the roots should remain the same. So, the roots of the cubic equation 5x3 -6x2 +24x +1 =0 are exactly the roots of the original equation. Therefore, Vieta's formulas apply directly here. So sum of roots is 6/5. Therefore, a + b + c = 6/5.
But wait, let me just check with an example. Suppose we have a simpler equation like 1/x = 1. Then multiplying by x gives 1 = x, which is correct. Another example: 1/x + x = 5. Multiplying by x gives 1 + x2 = 5x, which becomes x2 -5x +1 =0. The sum of roots here would be 5/1 =5, which makes sense because if you have x + 1/x =5, then the sum of roots should be 5. Wait, but in that case, the quadratic equation has roots whose sum is 5. Wait, but in the original equation, 1/x +x=5, the equation is for x, so roots would be numbers like x= (5 ± sqrt(25 -4))/2, so sum is 5. So sum of roots is 5, which matches 5/1. So, yes, process is correct. So in our current problem, we multiplied by x, which is valid since x isn't zero, and transformed into a cubic. Applied Vieta's formula: sum of roots is -(-6)/5 =6/5. So that should be correct. But to be thorough, perhaps I should verify if the equation has extraneous solutions or something else. Wait, when you multiply both sides by x, as long as x isn't zero, which it can't be because 1/x would be undefined, so all roots of the cubic must be valid. So, 5x3 -6x2 +24x +1 =0. The sum is 6/5. Alternatively, maybe double-check with another method? For instance, if I try to find the roots numerically and sum them up. But that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, think about the original equation: 1/x +5x2 =6x -24. Let's rearrange: 5x2 -6x +24 +1/x =0. Wait, but how can I consider this? Maybe let me consider that the equation is in terms of x and 1/x. However, unless there's a symmetry, it's hard to see another approach. Alternatively, perhaps substitute y =1/x. Let's see: If y =1/x, then the equation becomes: y + 5*(1/y)^2 =6*(1/y) -24. Multiplying by y2 to eliminate denominators: y3 +5 =6y -24y2. Then: y3 +5 =6y -24y2 => y3 +24y2 -6y +5=0. Hmmm, so this gives a cubic equation in terms of y: y3 +24y2 -6y +5=0. Then, the roots in y would correspond to the roots x=1/y. But maybe this is more complicated. Let's see, the original approach was easier. Alternatively, if the roots in y are α, β, γ, then the roots in terms of x would be 1/α, 1/β, 1/γ. Then sum a +b +c =1/α +1/β +1/γ. Which, for the cubic y3 +24y2 -6y +5=0, the sum 1/α +1/β +1/γ is equal to (βγ + αγ + αβ)/αβγ. From Vieta's formula for the cubic y3 +24y2 -6y +5=0, we have sum of roots α+β+γ = -24, sum αβ + αγ + βγ = -6, product αβγ = -5. Therefore, 1/α +1/β +1/γ = (αβ + αγ + βγ)/αβγ = (-6)/(-5) = 6/5. So that's the same result. Therefore, even through this substitution, we get that the sum is 6/5. Therefore, that verifies the same result as before. So both methods confirm that the sum is 6/5. Therefore, the answer is 6/5. So the final answer is 6/5.

Answer: Given the equation \(\frac{1}{x} + 5x^2 = 6x - 24\), we first eliminate the denominator by multiplying both sides by \(x\):

\[
1 + 5x^3 = 6x^2 - 24x
\]

Rearranging all terms to one side, we obtain the polynomial equation:

\[
5x^3 - 6x^2 + 24x + 1 = 0
\]

For a cubic equation of the form \(ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0\), the sum of the roots is given by \(-\frac{b}{a}\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = -6\). Therefore, the sum of the roots \(a + b + c\) is:

\[
-\frac{-6}{5} = \frac{6}{5}
\]

This result is verified by considering the substitution \(y = \frac{1}{x}\), leading to the cubic equation \(y^3 + 24y^2 - 6y + 5 = 0\). Using Vieta's formulas on this equation, the sum of the reciprocals of its roots (which correspond to the original roots) is \(\frac{-6}{-5} = \frac{6}{5}\).

Thus, the sum of the roots \(a + b + c\) is confirmed to be \(\frac{6}{5}\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{\frac{6}{5}}\).

answer: given the equation \(\frac{1}{x} + 5x^2 = 6x - 24\), we first eliminate the denominator by multiplying both sides by \(x\):

\[
1 + 5x^3 = 6x^2 - 24x
\]

rearranging all terms to one side, we obtain the polynomial equation:

\[
5x^3 - 6x^2 + 24x + 1 = 0
\]

for a cubic equation of the form \(ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0\), the sum of the roots is given by \(-\frac{b}{a}\). here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = -6\). therefore, the sum of the roots \(a + b + c\) is:

\[
-\frac{-6}{5} = \frac{6}{5}
\]

this result is verified by considering the substitution \(y = \frac{1}{x}\), leading to the cubic equation \(y^3 + 24y^2 - 6y + 5 = 0\). using vieta's formulas on this equation, the sum of the reciprocals of its roots (which correspond to the original roots) is \(\frac{-6}{-5} = \frac{6}{5}\).

thus, the sum of the roots \(a + b + c\) is confirmed to be \(\frac{6}{5}\).

the final answer is \(\boxed{\frac{6}{5}}\)
