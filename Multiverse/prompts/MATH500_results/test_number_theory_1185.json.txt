Okay, so I need to find the units digit of the superfactorial of 4, right?
The problem defines the superfactorial as n\$ which is n! raised to the power of itself n! times.
For 4\$, that would be 4! (which is 24) raised to the power of 24, that many times.
So, 24^24^24^...^24 with 24 terms in the power tower.
That's a massive number!
But I only need to find its units digit.
So maybe the key here is to figure out patterns in the units digits of powers of 24.
Wait, but first, let me confirm the definition.
The superfactorial is defined as n\$ = n! raised to the power of n!, a total of n! times.
So for n = 4, 4\$ = 24^24^24^...^24 with a total of 24 24s.
That means the power tower is 24^24^24^... and it's 24 24s tall.
But how do we compute the units digit of such a number?
I know that for finding the units digit of a^b, especially when b is large, we can look at patterns in the units digits of powers of a.
For example, the units digits of powers of integers repeat in cycles.
So, first, I should note that the units digit of 24 is 4.
Therefore, the units digit of 4\$ is the same as the units digit of 4^24^24^...^24 with 23 24s after the initial 24.
Wait, actually, the superfactorial is a^a^a^...^a with a total of a terms, where a is n!.
So for 4\$, it's 24^24^24^... 24, with 24 24s.
Wait, so that's a power tower of 24s of height 24.
But maybe I need to think of it as 24^24^24^... up to 24 times.
But how does this affect the units digit?
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: Determination of the units digit of 24^x for any integer x.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: Determination of the units digit of 4^x for any integer x, considering the pattern repetition and the effect of x's parity.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The units digit of 24^x is equivalent to the units digit of 4^x, as only the units digit of the base is relevant for the units digit of the result.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The units digit of 4 raised to an exponent x is determined by the pattern 4, 6, 4, 6, which repeats every two exponents. This pattern is 4 for odd x and 6 for even x. The parity of x is thus the key determinant. If the exponent x is odd, the units digit is 4; if x is even, the units digit is 6. The exponent in the problem is 24^24^24^... with 23 24s, which is a very large even number. Consequently, the units digit of 4 raised to this even exponent is 6.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The units digit of 24^x is equivalent to that of 4^x, which is 4 if x is odd and 6 if x is even. The units digit of 4^x is 4 for odd x and 6 for even x.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
But let's check: Wait, the units digit of powers of 4 cycles every 2.
Let's verify:
4^1 = 4 (units digit 4)
4^2 = 16 (units digit 6)
4^3 = 64 (units digit 4)
4^4 = 256 (units digit 6)
So, indeed, it alternates every odd/even exponent.
So for 4 raised to an even exponent, the units digit is 6, and for odd exponents, it's 4.
Therefore, the key question is: Is the exponent in 4\$ (which is the power tower 24^24^24^... with 23 24s) an even or an odd number?
But 24 is even, and any power of an even number is even.
So, each term in the power tower is even.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: Determination of the parity (evenness) of the exponent in the expression 4^exponent, where the exponent is a power tower of 24s of height 23.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: Confirmation that the units digit of 4 raised to an even exponent is 6.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The exponent in the expression 4^exponent is a power tower of 24s with a height of 23. Since 24 is an even number, any power of 24 is also even. Consequently, the exponent, being the result of multiplying even numbers, is itself even.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The units digit of 4 raised to an even exponent is 6.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The exponent in the expression 4^exponent is even, and the units digit of 4 raised to an even exponent is 6.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Therefore, the units digit of 4\$ is 6.
Wait, but hold on.
Let me make sure I'm applying the reasoning correctly here.

</Path>
<Conclusion>
The base of the power tower for 4\$ has a units digit of 4, and the exponent, represented by a power tower of 23 24s, is an even number.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So, the problem reduces to finding the units digit of 4^tower, where tower is this enormous even number.
Since the exponent is even, the units digit is 6.
Therefore, the answer is 6.
Wait, but let me verify this step-by-step.
First, the units digit of 24^n depends only on the units digit of 4^n.
So, indeed, we can focus on 4^n.
Now, as established, the units digit of 4^n cycles every 2 numbers: 4, 6, 4, 6, etc.
So, if the exponent is odd, it's 4; even, it's 6.
So the critical thing is to determine if the exponent (which is the power tower of 23 24s) is even or odd.
But 24 is even, and any power of an even number is even.
Therefore, the exponent is even.
So, 4^even ends with 6.
Therefore, the units digit is 6.
Wait, but another way to see it: The exponent is a power tower of 24s, height 23.
Each exponent is 24, which is even.
So, starting from the top, the exponent is 24, which is even.
So, even^even is even.
All the way down.
So, yes, the exponent is even.
Therefore, 4^even ends with 6.
Alternatively, let's check a simpler case.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: The units digit of 4^2, where the exponent 2 is an even number.

</Goal>
<Path>
1: The units digit of 4 raised to an exponent of 2 is 6.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The units digit of 4^24 is 6, as the exponent 24 is even.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The units digit of 4^2 is 6, and the units digit of 4^24 is also 6.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So, if the exponent is even, the units digit is 6.
Therefore, the exponent here is 24^24^24^... with 23 24s.
Since each 24 is even, then the exponent is even.
Therefore, the units digit of 4^(even) is 6.
Therefore, the units digit of 4\$ is 6.
But wait, hold on.
Is the power tower of 24's height 24 or 23?
Wait, the superfactorial is defined as n\$ = n! raised to the power of n!, a total of n! times.
So for n = 4, that's 24 raised to the power of 24, a total of 24 times.
Wait, but how does the power tower work?
Is it 24^24^24^... with 24 24s?
Or is it one less?
Wait, when you say "n! raised to the power of itself n! times", that could be interpreted as:
Option 1: Starting with the base 24, then raising to the power of 24, a total of 24 times.
So, that would be 24^24^24^... with 24 24s.
So, the tallest 24 in the power tower is the base, and then there are 23 more 24s as exponents.
Wait, but in tetration notation, n\$ would be ^24 24, which is 24 tetrated to 24, meaning a power tower of 24s of height 24.
But maybe.
Alternatively, if you think of it as iterated exponentiation, starting with 24 and raising to the 24th power, 24 times.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: The units digit of the base 24 in the power tower representation of 4\$.

The units digit of the base 24 is 4, and the exponent in the power tower, which consists of 23 24s, is an even number.

Therefore, since the exponent is even, the units digit of 4\$ is 6.
Wait, but let me make sure that the structure of the power tower is correct.
Let me think of smaller n.

<Path>
2: The superfactorial 2\$ is 2^2^2, which equals 16, and its units digit is 6.
</Path>
<Path>
3: For n=3, 3\$ is defined as 3! raised to the power of 3! a total of 3! times. The value of 3! is 6. The power tower for 3\$ is 6^6^6^6^6^6^6, with 6 6s. The units digit of 6 raised to any positive integer power is consistently 6.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The units digit of 1\$ is 1, the units digit of 2\$ is 6, and the units digit of 3\$ is 6.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Therefore, the units digit of 3\$ is 6.
Similarly, 2\$ is 16, units digit 6.
So, for n=2, 6; n=3, 6.
Wait, but n=1 is 1.
So, perhaps for n ≥2, the units digit is 6?
Wait, but 2\$ is 6, 3\$ is 6, would 4\$ also be 6?
Let me check with n=4.
But in our original problem, 4\$ is 24 raised to the power of 24, 24 times.
But through the reasoning of units digits:
The base is 24, so units digit is 4.
Then, as we saw, 4 raised to an even exponent gives units digit 6.
Since the exponent is a power tower of 24s (which are all even), starting from 24 (even), and each exponent is even, so the total exponent is even.
Therefore, units digit 6.
But wait, let's test with n=2: 2\$ = 2^2^2 = 16, which ends with 6. Correct.
n=3: 6\$ (6! = 720, but 3\$ is 6^6^6^6^6^6, which is a huge number, but units digit of 6 raised to anything is 6. Correct.
So, for n=4, same reasoning: if the base has units digit 4, and it's raised to an even exponent, the result has units digit 6.
Therefore, the units digit of 4\$ is 6.
Wait, but just to be thorough, let's consider that for units digit 4, the cycle length is 2.
So we need to determine the parity of the exponent.
Since the exponent is the power tower of 23 24s.
Since 24 is even, the exponent is even.
Therefore, 4^even has units digit 6.
Therefore, the answer is 6.
Wait, but another thing to consider: when you have power towers, the units digit can sometimes stabilize.
For example, for base 4, the cycle is short.
Let's see:
Compute the units digit of 4^tower where tower is a power tower.
Let's think in parallel.

<Conclusion>
The units digit of 4^2 is 6, and the units digit of 4^24 is also 6.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So, if the exponent is even, units digit is 6.
If the exponent is 2 or more, even, the units digit is 6.
But in our case, the exponent is a power tower of 23 24s.
So, the exponent is even.
Therefore, units digit 6.
Therefore, the units digit of 4\$ is 6.
**Final Answer** 
\boxed{6}
</Think>

Answer: To find the units digit of the superfactorial \(4\$\), we start by understanding that the superfactorial is defined as \(n\$ = n!^{n!^{n!^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{n!}}}}}}\) with \(n!\) instances of \(n!\). For \(4\$\), this translates to a power tower of 24s, 24 levels high.

The key observation is that the units digit of \(24^k\) depends only on the units digit of \(4^k\). The units digit of powers of 4 alternate every exponent: 4 (for odd exponents) and 6 (for even exponents). 

Since the exponent in \(4\$\) is a power tower of 24s (which are all even numbers), the exponent is even. Therefore, we need the units digit of \(4\) raised to an even power. 

Calculating the units digit of \(4\) raised to an even exponent:
- The units digit of \(4^2 = 16\) is 6.
- This pattern continues, with \(4\) raised to any even exponent ending in 6.

Thus, the units digit of \(4\$\) is determined by the units digit of \(4\) raised to an even exponent, which is 6.

</parallel>
therefore, the units digit of 3\$ is 6.
similarly, 2\$ is 16, units digit 6.
so, for n=2, 6; n=3, 6.
wait, but n=1 is 1.
so, perhaps for n ≥2, the units digit is 6?
wait, but 2\$ is 6, 3\$ is 6, would 4\$ also be 6?
let me check with n=4.
but in our original problem, 4\$ is 24 raised to the power of 24, 24 times.
but through the reasoning of units digits:
the base is 24, so units digit is 4.
then, as we saw, 4 raised to an even exponent gives units digit 6.
since the exponent is a power tower of 24s (which are all even), starting from 24 (even), and each exponent is even, so the total exponent is even.
therefore, units digit 6.
but wait, let's test with n=2: 2\$ = 2^2^2 = 16, which ends with 6. correct.
n=3: 6\$ (6! = 720, but 3\$ is 6^6^6^6^6^6, which is a huge number, but units digit of 6 raised to anything is 6. correct.
so, for n=4, same reasoning: if the base has units digit 4, and it's raised to an even exponent, the result has units digit 6.
therefore, the units digit of 4\$ is 6.
wait, but just to be thorough, let's consider that for units digit 4, the cycle length is 2.
so we need to determine the parity of the exponent.
since the exponent is the power tower of 23 24s.
since 24 is even, the exponent is even.
therefore, 4^even has units digit 6.
therefore, the answer is 6.
wait, but another thing to consider: when you have power towers, the units digit can sometimes stabilize.
for example, for base 4, the cycle is short.
let's see:
compute the units digit of 4^tower where tower is a power tower.
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>
<goal>
<outline>
1: determination of the units digit of 4^2.
</outline>
<outline>
2: determination of the units digit of 4^24.
</outline>
</goal>
<path>
1: the units digit of 4^2 is 6.
</path>
<path>
2: the units digit of 4^24 is 6.
</path>
<conclusion>
the units digit of 4^2 is 6, and the units digit of 4^24 is also 6.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
so, if the exponent is even, units digit is 6.
if the exponent is 2 or more, even, the units digit is 6.
but in our case, the exponent is a power tower of 23 24s.
so, the exponent is even.
therefore, units digit 6.
therefore, the units digit of 4\$ is 6.
**final answer** 
\boxed{6}
</think>

answer: to find the units digit of the superfactorial \(4\$\), we start by understanding that the superfactorial is defined as \(n\$ = n!^{n!^{n!^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{n!}}}}}}\) with \(n!\) instances of \(n!\). for \(4\$\), this translates to a power tower of 24s, 24 levels high.

the key observation is that the units digit of \(24^k\) depends only on the units digit of \(4^k\). the units digit of powers of 4 alternate every exponent: 4 (for odd exponents) and 6 (for even exponents). 

since the exponent in \(4\$\) is a power tower of 24s (which are all even numbers), the exponent is even. therefore, we need the units digit of \(4\) raised to an even power. 

calculating the units digit of \(4\) raised to an even exponent:
- the units digit of \(4^2 = 16\) is 6.
- this pattern continues, with \(4\) raised to any even exponent ending in 6.

thus, the units digit of \(4\$\) is determined by the units digit of \(4\) raised to an even exponent, which is 6.

\boxed{6}
