问题: Tom got a Mr. Potato Head for his birthday. It came with 3 hairstyles, 2 sets of eyebrows, 1 pair of googly eyes, 2 sets of ears, and 2 sets of lips, a pair of regular shoes, and a bonus pair of clown shoes. If a complete Mr. Potato Head personality includes eyebrows, eyes, ears, lips, shoes and optionally hair, how many different wacky personalities can Tom come up with? Note that Mr. Potato Head can be bald.

Note: You cannot "mix and match".  For example, you cannot take the left eyebrow from one pair and the right eyebrow from the other pair.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many different wacky personalities Tom can create for his Mr. Potato Head.
Let me try to break this down.
First, let's list out all the components and how many options there are for each.
The problem mentions hairstyles: 3 options.
But it also says that Mr. Potato Head can be bald, so that adds another option.
So total hairstyles would be 3 + 1 = 4?
Wait, no, wait.
Wait, let me check the problem again.
Let me read the problem statement carefully.
It says: "It came with 3 hairstyles, 2 sets of eyebrows, 1 pair of googly eyes, 2 sets of ears, and 2 sets of lips, a pair of regular shoes, and a bonus pair of clown shoes."
Then it says: "a complete Mr. Potato Head personality includes eyebrows, eyes, ears, lips, shoes and optionally hair, how many different wacky personalities can Tom come up with? Note that Mr. Potato Head can be bald."
So for hairstyles: there are 3 hairstyles, but since bald is also an option, that's 3 + 1 = 4 options for hair.
Wait, but the problem says "optionally hair", so that implies that hair is optional, so including bald, it's 3 + 1 = 4.
But maybe the 3 hairstyles already include different options, including bald?
No, the problem says "3 hairstyles" and separately notes that "Mr. Potato Head can be bald".
So I think even if the 3 hairstyles are different, the bald is an additional option.
So total hair options: 4.
Then eyebrows: 2 sets.
Since you have to include eyebrows, so that's 2 choices.
Eyes: 1 pair of googly eyes.
So only 1 option, so that's 1.
Ears: 2 sets, so 2 options.
Lips: 2 sets, so 2 options.
Shoes: a pair of regular shoes and a bonus pair of clown shoes.
So that's 2 options for shoes.
Now, the key here is that each of these components is chosen independently, right?
So the total number of different personalities would be the product of the number of options for each component.
But wait, let me think.
Wait, the problem says "complete Mr. Potato Head personality includes eyebrows, eyes, ears, lips, shoes and optionally hair".
So hair is optional, but the other components are mandatory.
But since hair being optional gives 4 options (3 hairstyles + bald), as I thought earlier.
So then, total combinations would be 4 (hair) * 2 (eyebrows) * 1 (eyes) * 2 (ears) * 2 (lips) * 2 (shoes).
Let me multiply that step by step.
4 * 2 = 8
8 * 1 = 8
8 * 2 = 16
16 * 2 = 32
32 * 2 = 64
Wait, so 64 different personalities?
But hold on, let me check again.
The problem also says "Note that you cannot 'mix and match'. For example, you cannot take the left eyebrow from one pair and the right eyebrow from another pair."
So that means that each pair is a complete set, so when you choose a set of eyebrows, ears, etc., you don't split the pairs.
So, for example, you can't use left eyebrow from one set and right from another.
But since the problem states that they come as sets (pairs), then when it's said that there are 2 sets of eyebrows, that probably means each set is a pair (left and right).
So when you choose a set of eyebrows, you're choosing both left and right as a pair.
So that makes each set a single unit, so that's 2 options for the entire eyebrow set.
Similarly for ears, lips, etc.
So then my calculation seems correct: 4 * 2 * 1 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 64.
But wait, hold on, maybe the googly eyes are the only option for eyes, so that's 1.
So multiplying by 1.
But the problem doesn't mention any other eye options, so maybe that's correct.
Wait, but the problem says "a pair of googly eyes", so that's singular, so only 1 pair, so that's 1 option.
So yes, that's correct.
So then the total number is 64.
But let me think again.
Hair: 4 options (3 +1)
Eyebrows: 2
Eyes: 1
Ears: 2
Lips: 2
Shoes: 2
Multiply all together: 4*2*1*2*2*2.
Let's compute:
4 * 2 = 8
8 * 1 = 8
8 * 2 = 16
16 * 2 = 32
32 * 2 = 64
Yes, 64.
But wait, the problem is called "wacky personalities", so maybe there's more to it?
Hmm.
Let me check again.
Are there any other components?
The problem mentions "3 hairstyles, 2 sets of eyebrows, 1 pair of googly eyes, 2 sets of ears, and 2 sets of lips, a pair of regular shoes, and a bonus pair of clown shoes."
So that's all the components.
So each of these contributes their respective number of options.
But maybe I need to account for something else?
Hmm.
Wait, maybe the fact that the Mr. Potato Head can be bald is already included in the hairstyle options, but the problem mentions it separately.
Wait, the problem says "It came with 3 hairstyles", then lists the other components.
Then in the note, it says Mr. Potato Head can be bald.
So maybe bald is an additional option beyond the 3 hairstyles?
So that would make 4.
So yes, as I originally thought.
Alternatively, maybe the 3 hairstyles are separate, and then bald is the fourth.
So then 4 hairstyles, but since hair is optional, but if the 3 hairstyles are separate items, then maybe not.
Wait, no, the problem says "3 hairstyles", so that's three different options.
Then it says "Mr. Potato Head can be bald", so that's a fourth option.
So total of four for hair.
So the calculation is correct.
So total number is 64.
But let me check again.
Suppose for each component, the choices are: Hair: 3 hairstyles + 1 bald = 4 Eyebrows: 2 Eyes: 1 Ears: 2 Lips: 2 Shoes: 2
So 4*2*1*2*2*2=64.
Hmm.
Wait, but the problem says "optionally hair", so that means that hair is optional, so for each of the other components, you have to multiply by the number of options including the no-hair option.
Wait, but if it's optional, does that mean that the hair can be there or not?
But in this case, the problem already includes the bald option as part of the hair choices.
So the three hairstyles plus bald, which is four.
So that's already accounted for.
So if you choose the bald option, then there's no hair.
So the word "optionally" is covered by the bald being an option.
So that's correct.
So therefore, 64.
But let me think again.
Suppose you have: - 4 hair options (3 + bald) - 2 eyebrow options - 1 eye option - 2 ear options - 2 lip options - 2 shoe options
So if each of these is independent, then the total combinations would indeed be the product, which is 4*2*1*2*2*2=64.
Hmm.
Wait, but maybe the problem is more complicated because some attributes can't be mixed.
Wait, no, the problem says you cannot mix and match, for example, taking left eyebrow from one pair and right from another.
But since the components are all pairs (eyebrows, ears, lips, shoes), when you choose a set, you get both sides together.
But in the problem, when you select a component, you have to take the entire set.
So the multiplication is correct.
So the answer is 64.
But wait, let me check.
Suppose for each category, you have: 1. Hair: 4 options 2. Eyebrows: 2 options 3. Eyes: 1 option 4. Ears: 2 options 5. Lips: 2 options 6. Shoes: 2 options
So each of these choices is independent, so the total number of combinations is the product of each category's options.
So 4 * 2 * 1 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 4 * 2 * 1 * 2 * 2 * 2
Let's compute step by step:
4 (hair) * 2 (eyebrows) = 8
8 * 1 (eyes) = 8
8 * 2 (ears) = 16
16 * 2 (lips) = 32
32 * 2 (shoes) = 64
Yes, 64.
So that's the answer.
Wait, but just to make sure, let's think of another way.
Maybe using the formula for combinations.
Each attribute contributes a certain number of choices.
Since all choices are independent (you can mix and match different attributes, except within each set), so for example, you can choose any hairstyle (or none) with any eyebrows, etc.
So the total combinations are indeed the product.
So the answer is 64.
So the answer should be 64.
Wait, but the problem says "the Mr. Potato Head came with 3 hairstyles..." etc., so these are the available options.
So if all the parts must be used from what's included, which is the case, since it's about combining the included parts.
So the calculation is correct.
Therefore, the final answer is 64.
But let me check once more.
If in each category, the number of choices is as follows: Hairstyles: 3 + 1 (bald) = 4 Eyebrows: 2 Eyes: 1 (only googly eyes) Ears: 2 Lips: 2 Shoes: 2
Multiply all together: 4 * 2 * 1 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 64.
Yes.
Yep, that's the answer.
**Final Answer** 
\boxed{64}
</Think>

Answer: To determine the number of different wacky personalities Tom can create for his Mr. Potato Head, we need to consider the number of options available for each component and how they can be combined. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Hairstyles**: There are 3 hairstyles plus the option for bald, giving a total of 4 choices.
2. **Eyebrows**: There are 2 sets of eyebrows.
3. **Eyes**: There is 1 pair of googly eyes.
4. **Ears**: There are 2 sets of ears.
5. **Lips**: There are 2 sets of lips.
6. **Shoes**: There are 2 pairs of shoes (regular and clown shoes).

Since each component is chosen independently, the total number of different personalities is the product of the number of options for each component:

\[
4 \text{ (hairstyles)} \times 2 \text{ (eyebrows)} \times 1 \text{ (eyes)} \times 2 \text{ (ears)} \times 2 \text{ (lips)} \times 2 \text{ (shoes)} = 4 \times 2 \times 1 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2
\]

Calculating step-by-step:
\[
4 \times 2 = 8
\]
\[
8 \times 1 = 8
\]
\[
8 \times 2 = 16
\]
\[
16 \times 2 = 32
\]
\[
32 \times 2 = 64
\]

Thus, the total number of different wacky personalities Tom can come up with is \(\boxed{64}\).

since each component is chosen independently, the total number of different personalities is the product of the number of options for each component:

\[
4 \text{ (hairstyles)} \times 2 \text{ (eyebrows)} \times 1 \text{ (eyes)} \times 2 \text{ (ears)} \times 2 \text{ (lips)} \times 2 \text{ (shoes)} = 4 \times 2 \times 1 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2

calculating step-by-step:
\[
4 \times 2 = 8
\]
\[
8 \times 1 = 8
\]
\[
8 \times 2 = 16

\[
16 \times 2 = 32
