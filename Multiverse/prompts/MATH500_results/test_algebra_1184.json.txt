Okay, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. So we have a sequence that starts with 0, and each subsequent term is generated by alternately adding and multiplying with each successive integer starting from 1. The example given shows the second term is 0 + 1 = 1, the third term is 1 * 1 = 1, the fourth term is 1 + 2 = 3, and so on. I need to find the first term in this sequence that is greater than 125.
First, let me make sure I understand the pattern correctly. Let's break down how each term is generated:
- Start with the first term: 0.
- To get the second term, add 1: 0 + 1 = 1.
- Third term, multiply the second term by 1: 1 * 1 = 1.
- Fourth term, add 2 to the third term: 1 + 2 = 3.
- Fifth term, multiply the fourth term by 2: 3 * 2 = 6.
- Sixth term, add 3 to the fifth term: 6 + 3 = 9.
- Seventh term, multiply the sixth term by 3: 9 * 3 = 27.
- And so on...
Hmm, so the operations alternate between addition and multiplication, and the numbers we're adding or multiplying by start at 1 and increase by 1 each time. So the first operation uses 1, then 1, then 2, then 2, then 3, then 3, and so on. Wait, actually, each successive integer is used once for addition and then for multiplication? Let me verify.
Looking at the given terms:
1st term: 0
2nd term: 0 + 1 = 1 (add 1)
3rd term: 1 * 1 = 1 (multiply by 1)
4th term: 1 + 2 = 3 (add 2)
5th term: 3 * 2 = 6 (multiply by 2)
6th term: 6 + 3 = 9 (add 3)
7th term: 9 * 3 = 27 (multiply by 3)
So yeah, the pattern seems to be: starting with n=1, alternately add n, then multiply by n, then add n+1, multiply by n+1, and so on. So each number n is used once for addition and once for multiplication, in that order, as we progress through the terms. Each operation alternates between addition and multiplication, with the number n incrementing every two steps.
Therefore, for even-indexed terms (2nd, 4th, 6th, etc.), the operation is addition, and for odd-indexed terms (3rd, 5th, 7th, etc.), the operation is multiplication, with the multiplier n being (term_index // 2) when starting from index 1. Wait, let me check that.
Alternatively, maybe the operations pair up: for the k-th pair, you add k then multiply by k. Then each pair is add k, multiply by k, with k increasing by 1 for each pair. Let me think. Let's map out the operations:
First term (index 1): 0
Second term (index 2): previous term + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1
Third term (index 3): previous term * 1 = 1 * 1 = 1
Fourth term (index 4): previous term + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3
Fifth term (index 5): previous term * 2 = 3 * 2 = 6
Sixth term (index 6): previous term + 3 = 6 + 3 = 9
Seventh term (index 7): previous term * 3 = 9 * 3 = 27
Eighth term (index 8): previous term + 4 = 27 + 4 = 31
Ninth term (index 9): previous term * 4 = 31 * 4 = 124
Tenth term (index 10): previous term + 5 = 124 + 5 = 129
Wait, the ninth term is 124, which is still not greater than 125. Then the tenth term is 124 + 5 = 129, which is greater than 125. So is 129 the first term greater than 125? Let me verify by calculating each term step by step.
Let me list out all terms one by one, specifying the operation at each step.
Starting with term 1: 0
Term 2: 0 + 1 = 1 (add 1)
Term 3: 1 * 1 = 1 (multiply by 1)
Term 4: 1 + 2 = 3 (add 2)
Term 5: 3 * 2 = 6 (multiply by 2)
Term 6: 6 + 3 = 9 (add 3)
Term 7: 9 * 3 = 27 (multiply by 3)
Term 8: 27 + 4 = 31 (add 4)
Term 9: 31 * 4 = 124 (multiply by 4)
Term 10: 124 + 5 = 129 (add 5)
Yes, so the tenth term is 129, which is the first term greater than 125. But let me check again to ensure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations.
Term1: 0
Term2: 0 + 1 = 1
Term3: 1 * 1 = 1
Term4: 1 + 2 = 3
Term5: 3 * 2 = 6
Term6: 6 + 3 = 9
Term7: 9 * 3 = 27
Term8: 27 + 4 = 31
Term9: 31 * 4 = 124
Term10:124 + 5 = 129
Yup, that seems correct. So the first term greater than 125 is 129, which is the 10th term. But before I get too confident, let me double-check my steps again. Sometimes when I manually compute terms, I can make off-by-one errors or miscount terms.
Starting again:
Term1: 0
Term2: 0 + 1 = 1 (add 1)
Term3: 1 * 1 = 1 (multiply by 1)
Term4: 1 + 2 = 3 (add 2)
Term5: 3 * 2 = 6 (multiply by 2)
Term6: 6 + 3 = 9 (add 3)
Term7: 9 * 3 = 27 (multiply by 3)
Term8: 27 + 4 = 31 (add 4)
Term9: 31 * 4 = 124 (multiply by 4)
Term10:124 + 5 = 129 (add 5)
Yep, each time alternating between addition and multiplication, and incrementing the number n each time. So the sequence alternates operations and increments the value each time, resulting in the 10th term being 129.
Therefore, the answer should be 129.
But wait, let me confirm once more because the problem says "the first term that is greater than 125". Let's check term9: 124, which is less than 125, so the next term is term10: 129, which is greater. So 129 is indeed the first one.
Alternatively, maybe there is a miscalculation when stepping through the operations. Let's recompute each term:
Term1: 0
Term2: 0 + 1 = 1
Term3: 1 * 1 = 1
Term4: 1 + 2 = 3
Term5: 3 * 2 = 6
Term6: 6 + 3 = 9
Term7: 9 * 3 = 27
Term8: 27 + 4 = 31
Term9: 31 * 4 = 124
Term10:124 + 5 = 129
Each step looks correct. So the first term greater than 125 is 129, which is the 10th term. So the answer should be 129. Hmm, but wait, is 129 indeed greater than 125? Yes, 129 > 125. And the previous term is 124, which is not greater than 125. So 129 must be the correct answer.
Alternatively, maybe I miscounted the terms? Let's check the term numbering.
Term1: 0
Term2: 1
Term3:1
Term4:3
Term5:6
Term6:9
Term7:27
Term8:31
Term9:124
Term10:129
Yes, Term10 is 129. So the first term greater than 125 is 129.
Therefore, I think the answer is 129.
Wait, but just to be thorough, let's see if there's another possible interpretation of the problem. The problem says: "Subsequent terms are produced by alternately adding and multiplying by each successive integer beginning with 1." So starting with n=1, you alternate adding n and multiplying by n, then increment n for the next pair of operations. That's how I interpreted it, and that leads to 129. Another possible interpretation? Maybe the operations are not strictly alternating per term, but somehow else? Let me read the problem again.
"In sequence 0, 1, 1, 3, 6, 9, 27, ...", so the given sequence starts with those numbers. The first term is 0. Subsequent terms are produced by alternately adding and multiplying by each successive integer beginning with 1. For instance, the second term is produced by adding 1 to the first term; the third term is produced by multiplying the second term by 1; the fourth term is produced by adding 2 to the third term; and so on.
So the example given in the problem statement matches my interpretation. So S1 = 0. S2 = S1 + 1. S3 = S2 * 1. S4 = S3 + 2. S5 = S4 * 2. S6 = S5 + 3. S7 = S6 * 3. S8 = S7 + 4. S9 = S8 * 4. S10 = S9 + 5. Therefore, S10 is 129. So unless I made a miscalculation in one of the steps, which I retrace and don't see, 129 is correct.
Therefore, the answer is 129.
**Final Answer**
\boxed{129}
</Think>

Answer: The sequence starts with 0, and each subsequent term is generated by alternately adding and multiplying with each successive integer starting from 1. Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. Term1: \(0\)

3. Term3: \(1 \times 1 = 1\) (multiply by 1)
4. Term4: \(1 + 2 = 3\) (add 2)
5. Term5: \(3 \times 2 = 6\) (multiply by 2)
6. Term6: \(6 + 3 = 9\) (add 3)
7. Term7: \(9 \times 3 = 27\) (multiply by 3)
8. Term8: \(27 + 4 = 31\) (add 4)
9. Term9: \(31 \times 4 = 124\) (multiply by 4)
10. Term10: \(124 + 5 = 129\) (add 5)

The first term greater than 125 is 129.
