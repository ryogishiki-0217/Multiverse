Okay, so I need to solve this problem about a geometric series. Let me read it again: The series is $4 + \frac{12}{a} + \frac{36}{a^2} + \cdots$, and we're told that the sum of this series is a perfect square. We need to find the smallest possible value of $a$, where $a$ is a positive integer.
Alright, first, let's recall what a geometric series is. It's a series where each term after the first is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a constant ratio, right? So the general form is $S = \text{first term} + \text{first term} \times r + \text{first term} \times r^2 + \cdots$, where $r$ is the common ratio.
The sum of an infinite geometric series with |r| < 1 is given by $S = \frac{\text{first term}}{1 - r}$. So, for this series to converge, the common ratio must be between -1 and 1, not inclusive.
But in this problem, $a$ is a positive integer, so all terms are positive, and we need the common ratio to be between 0 and 1 so that the series converges.
Let's think in parallel.

1: The first term of the series is 4. The second term is 12/a, and the third term is 36/a². The common ratio, r, is found by dividing the second term by the first term. This calculation yields r = (12/a) / 4, which simplifies to r = 3/a.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The sum of the infinite geometric series is a perfect square. The series converges if the absolute value of the common ratio, |r|, is less than 1. Since the common ratio r is positive (as 'a' is a positive integer), this convergence condition simplifies to r < 1, which is equivalent to 3/a < 1. The condition for convergence is that the common ratio r must be less than 1. Given that r is positive, this implies 3/a < 1.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The common ratio of the series is 3/a. The series converges if and only if the common ratio 3/a is less than 1, which is equivalent to the condition a > 3.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Therefore, $a$ must be greater than 3. Since $a$ is a positive integer, the possible values for $a$ start from 4 upwards.
But we need the sum of the series to be a perfect square. So first, let's find the sum in terms of $a$.
The first term is 4, and the common ratio is $\frac{3}{a}$.
Therefore, the sum $S$ is $\frac{4}{1 - \frac{3}{a}}$, provided that $\frac{3}{a} < 1$.
Simplify the sum expression: S = 4 / (1 - 3/a) = 4 / ((a - 3)/a) = 4a/(a - 3).
So the sum $S = \frac{4a}{a - 3}$. This must be a perfect square.
We need to find the smallest positive integer $a > 3$ such that $\frac{4a}{a - 3}$ is a perfect square.
Let me write that as an equation:
Let $\frac{4a}{a - 3} = k^2$, where $k$ is a positive integer.
Then solve for $a$ in terms of $k$:
Multiply both sides by $(a - 3)$: $4a = k^2(a - 3)$
Bring all terms to one side: $4a - k^2(a - 3) = 0$
Expand: $4a - k^2a + 3k^2 = 0$
Factor $a$: $a(4 - k^2) + 3k^2 = 0$
Then, $a(4 - k^2) = -3k^2$
Multiply both sides by -1: $a(k^2 - 4) = 3k^2$
Therefore, $a = \frac{3k^2}{k^2 - 4}$
But $a$ must be a positive integer, so $k^2 - 4$ must divide $3k^2$.
Moreover, since $a > 3$, as we concluded earlier from the convergence requirement, we have $\frac{3k^2}{k^2 - 4} > 3$
Let me check that inequality:
$\frac{3k^2}{k^2 - 4} > 3$
Dividing both sides by 3: $\frac{k^2}{k^2 - 4} > 1$
Subtract 1 from both sides: $\frac{k^2 - (k^2 - 4)}{k^2 - 4} > 0 ⇒ \frac{4}{k^2 - 4} > 0$
Which implies that $k^2 - 4 > 0 ⇒ k^2 > 4 ⇒ k > 2$, since $k$ is a positive integer.
Therefore, $k ≥ 3$.
So $k$ starts from 3 upwards.
But we need $a = \frac{3k^2}{k^2 - 4}$ to be a positive integer.

Wait, but maybe there's a better way than trial and error.
Let me go back to the equation:
$a = \frac{3k^2}{k^2 - 4}$
For $a$ to be an integer, the denominator $k^2 - 4$ must divide $3k^2$.
Since $k^2 - 4$ divides $3k^2$, let's write this as:
$k^2 - 4$ divides 3k2.
But since $k^2$ and $k^2 - 4$ are coprime except for possible common factors of 2.
Because if a prime p divides $k^2$ and $k^2 - 4$, then p divides $(k^2 - 4) - k^2 = -4$.
Therefore, the common prime factors can only be 2.
So let's factor out gcd(k2, k2 -4).
We have gcd(k2, k2 -4) = gcd(k2, 4).
If k is even, then gcd(k2,4) is 4 (if k is even, let k = 2m, then k2 = 4m2, so gcd(4m2,4)=4).
If k is odd, then gcd(k2,4)=1, since k2 is odd.
Therefore, let's consider two cases: k even and k odd.
Case 1: k is even.
Let k = 2m.
Then, k2 = 4m2, k2 -4 = 4(m2 -1).
Substitute into the expression for a:
a = 3*(4m2) / (4(m2 -1)) ) = (12m2)/(4(m2 -1)) )= (3m2)/(m2 -1)
So for a to be integer, (m2 -1) must divide 3m2.
But m2 -1 divides 3m2.
Let's write this as m2 -1 divides 3.
Because m2 -1 and m2 are coprime.
Because gcd(m2, m2 -1)=1.
Therefore, gcd(m2 -1, m2)=1, so m2 -1 divides 3.
Therefore, m2 -1 must be a divisor of 3.
The positive divisors of 3 are 1 and 3.
Therefore, m2 -1=1 or m2 -1=3.
If m2 -1=1, then m2=2, which is not possible for integer m.
If m2 -1=3, then m2=4, so m=2.
Therefore, only possible m=2.
Therefore, k=2m=4.
Then a = 3*(4)^2 / ( (4)^2 -4 )= 3*16 / (16 -4)=48 /12=4.
Which we found earlier.
So when k is even, the only possible k is 4, which gives a=4.
Case 2: k is odd.
Let k be an odd positive integer greater than 2 (since k≥3).
Then, gcd(k2, k2 -4)=1, as established earlier.
Therefore, in this case, k2 -4 must divide 3k2, but since k2 -4 and k2 are coprime, it follows that k2 -4 divides 3.
Therefore, k2 -4 must be a positive divisor of 3.
Since k is odd and >=3, k2 -4 can be 3*1=3 (when k=√(3+4)=√7, not integer), or k2 -4=1, which would mean k2=5 (k=√5, not integer), or k2-4=3, which as above, not integer.
Alternatively, perhaps considering k^2 -4 divides 3.
Wait, k is odd and >=3, so k2 -4 is odd and >=5.
But 3 is a prime.
Its positive divisors are 1 and 3.
But k2 -4 must divide 3, so k2 -4 =1 or 3.
If k2 -4=1, then k2=5, not integer.
If k2 -4=3, then k2=7, also not integer.
Therefore, there are no solutions for odd k.
Therefore, the only possible value is when k=4 (even), which gives a=4.
Wait, but earlier when I tried k=5, which is odd, a was 75/21=25/7, which is not integer, as expected.
So according to this reasoning, the only possible a is 4.
But when k=4, we get a=4, which is a positive integer greater than 3, and the sum S= 4a/(a-3)=4*4/(4-3)=16/1=16, which is a perfect square.
So that works.
But earlier when trying k=5, which is not possible, and other even ks like k=6, which gave a non-integer a.
Wait, but in case 1, when k is even, we concluded that the only possible m is 2, leading to k=4.
So that is the only solution.
But let me check for other possible m.
Wait, we had that m must satisfy m2 -1 divides 3.
So d = m2 -1 must divide 3.
The divisors d>0 are 1 and 3.
So m2 -1=1 → m2=2, nope.
m2 -1=3 → m2=4, m=2.
So indeed, only m=2.
Therefore, the only possible k is 4, leading to a=4.
Therefore, the minimal a is 4.
But wait, the problem says "the smallest possible value of a where a is a positive integer".
So according to this, the answer is 4.
Wait, but let's check if there could be other a values.
Wait, in the case when we considered k even, and the expression simplifies, but for k odd, even though k2-4 would need to divide 3, but since k is odd, k2 -4 is ≡ (1 -4) mod 2 ≡ (-3) mod 2 ≡ 1 mod 2, so it's odd.
The divisors of 3 are 1 and 3, so as above.
So since m had to be such that m2 -1 divides 3, but m=2 gives the only viable k=4.
Therefore, 4 is the minimal a.
But wait, when a=4, sum S=16, which is a perfect square.
So that works.
But let me check for other possible a.
Suppose I didn't do the parametrization.
Let me think again.
We have S = 4a/(a -3) must be a perfect square.
So 4a/(a -3) = n2 for some integer n.
Then, rearranged: 4a = n2(a -3)
Which is the same equation as before.
So, 4a = n2a - 3n2
Bring all terms to one side: 4a - n2a + 3n2 =0
Factor a: a(4 - n2) + 3n2 =0
So a= 3n2/(n2 -4).
Same as before, with n being a positive integer greater than 2.
But previously, n would correspond to k in the previous notation.
But here, n is sqrt(S), so if S is a square, n is its square root.
But in any case, same equation.
So, same conclusion: for a to be integer, n^2 -4 must divide 3.
So n2 -4 divides 3.
Therefore, n2 -4=1 or 3.
Thus, n2=5 or 7, neither of which are squares.
Unless... Wait, but here n must be an integer, so n2 must be integer.
But n2 -4 divides 3 and n is integer.
So n2 -4 ∈ {1,3}.
So n2=5 or 7, which are not squares.
Therefore, no solutions?
Wait, but earlier with k=4, we had n=4.
Wait, confusion between variables.
Wait, when we set n as sqrt(S), then S=16 when a=4, so n=4.
But according to the equation, n2= 4a/(a-3).
If a=4, n2=4*4/(4-3)=16/1=16, so n=4.
So how does this reconcile with the previous?
Ah, here n corresponds to k in previous steps.
Wait, perhaps the problem is in considering n as any integer causing confusion.
Let me rederive.
If S = 4a/(a -3) must be a perfect square, say S = m2 for integer m >=1.
Then 4a/(a -3) = m2 ⇒ 4a = m2(a -3)
Rearranging: 4a - m2 a + 3m2 =0 ⇒ a(4 -m2) +3m2 =0 ⇒ a = 3m2/(m2 -4)
Same as before.
So here m is any positive integer such that m2 >4 (so m >=3), and m2 -4 divides 3m2.
But m is arbitrary?
Wait, but again, m^2 -4 must divide 3m2.
Since m2 and m2 -4 are coprime (since gcd(m2, m2 -4) divides 4).
But m2 -4 divides 3m2, and gcd(m2, m2 -4) divides 4, so m2 -4 must divide 3*(m2 -4) + 4*(something).
Wait, perhaps another approach.
Let d = m2 -4.
Then d divides 3m2.
Since d = m2 -4, m2 ≡ 4 mod d.
So 3m2 ≡ 12 ≡ 0 mod d.
Therefore, d divides 12.
Therefore, m2 -4 divides 12.
So m2 -4 must be a positive divisor of 12.
Since m is integer, m >=3, so m2 -4 can be 5, 8, 9, 12, etc.
But m2 -4 divides 12, which has divisors 1,2,3,4,6,12.
So possible m2 -4 ∈ {1,2,3,4,6,12}.
Therefore, m2 is in {5,6,7,8,10,16}.
But m must be integer >=3.
So m >=3 implies m2 >=9.
So among the possible m2 listed above, only 16 is greater than or equal to 9.
So m2=16, which implies m=4.
Therefore, m=4.
Then d = m2 -4 = 16 -4 =12.
So d divides 12, which is correct.
Therefore, m=4.
Then a= 3m2/(m2 -4) = 3*16 /12 = 48/12=4.
So the only m that works is m=4, leading to a=4.
Therefore, 4 is the only possible a.
Thus, the minimal a is 4.
But wait, the problem says "the smallest possible value of a where a is a positive integer".
So 4 is the answer.
But let me check.
Wait, when a=4, the common ratio is 3/4, which is less than 1, so the series converges.
The sum is indeed 16, which is a perfect square.
Perfect.
But is there another a leading to S being a perfect square?
Suppose m2 -4 divides 12, but maybe m is not an integer.
Wait, m must be integer, as it's the square root of S.
So if S is a perfect square, m is integer.
So m must be 4.
So a=4 is the only solution.
Therefore, 4 is the smallest possible a.
Hence, the answer is 4.
Wait, but in my earlier trials, when I tried k=5, I got a=25/7≈3.57, which is not integer.
For k=6, a=27/8≈3.375, not integer.
k=7 gives a=3*49/(49−4)=147/45=49/15≈3.266, not integer.
k=8 gives a=3*(64)/(64−4)=192/60=16/5=3.2, not integer.
As k increases, a decreases towards 3, but since a must be >3 and integer, but all these values are fractional.
Wait, but hang on, when k=4, which is even, m=2, gives a=4.
If m is 3, which would make k even as 2m=6, leading to a=27/8, not integer.
So seems like indeed only a=4 is possible.
Alternatively, maybe there's a larger k where a is integer.
Let me check k= some higher value.
Suppose k= some value where k2−4 divides 3k2.
Wait, but previously, through the reasoning, only k=4 gives valid answer.
Alternatively, suppose n is some integer, and let's solve 4a/(a−3)=n2.
So 4a = n2(a−3)
Rearranged: 4a = an2 −3n2
⇒ 4a −an2 = −3n2
⇒ a(4 −n2) = −3n2
⇒ a(n2 −4) =3n2
⇒ a= 3n2/(n2−4)
So, for a to be positive integer, n2 −4 divides 3n2.
Let’s set d = n2 −4.
Then d divides 3(n2).
But since d divides n2 (because d divides 3n2 and gcd(d, n2) = ?).
Wait, let's compute gcd(d, n2).
Since d = n2 −4, then gcd(d, n2) = gcd(n2 −4, n2) = gcd(4, n2).
Because n2 ≡ 0 mod gcd(n2 −4, n2), and n2 = q*(n2 −4) + 4, so gcd(n2 −4, n2) = gcd(n2 −4, 4).
Therefore, if n is even, then gcd(n2 −4,4)=4 (if n is even, n=2m, so n2=4m2, so n2−4=4m2−4=4(m2−1), so gcd(4(m2−1),4)=4).
If n is odd, then gcd(n2 −4,4)= gcd(odd − even,4)= gcd(odd,4)=1.
Therefore, two cases:
Case 1: n even.
Let n=2p.
Then d = (2p)^2 −4 =4p2 −4=4(p2 −1).
Then, since d=4(p2 −1), and 3n2=3*4p2=12p2.
Therefore, d divides 12p2 ⇒ 4(p2 −1) divides 12p2 ⇒ (p2 −1) divides 3p2.
But (p2 −1) and p2 are coprime, since consecutive integers.
So gcd(p2 −1, p2)=1.
Therefore, p2 −1 divides 3.
Therefore, p2 −1=1 or 3.
If p2 −1=1, then p2=2, no integer p.
If p2 −1=3, then p2=4, p=2.
Therefore, only possible p=2.
Therefore, n=2p=4, leading to a=3*42/(42−4)=3*16/12=48/12=4.
So that's the same as before.
Case 2: n is odd.
Then d= n2 −4, and 3n2 must be divisible by d.
Since n is odd, d = n2 −4 ≡ 1 − 0 ≡1 mod 2 (odd).
gcd(d,3n2)= gcd(n2−4, 3n2).
Since n is odd, let's compute gcd(n2−4,3).
Since n is odd, n=2p+1, n2=4p2 +4p +1.
So n2−4=4p2 +4p +1 −4=4p2 +4p −3.
Therefore, gcd(4p2 +4p −3,3).
Since 4p2 +4p −3 ≡ (1)p2 +1p −0 ≡ p2 +p mod 3.
Therefore, gcd(4p2 +4p −3,3)= gcd(p2 +p,3).
Since p can be 0,1,2 mod3.
If p=0 mod3: then p=3q, then p2 +p=9q2 +3q≡0 mod3.
If p=1 mod3: p=3q+1, p2 +p=9q2 +6q +1 +3q +1=9q2 +9q +2≡2 mod3.
If p=2 mod3: p=3q+2, p2 +p=9q2 +12q +4 +3q +2=9q2 +15q +6≡0 mod3.
Therefore, if p ≡0 or 2 mod3, then gcd(p2 +p,3)=3, else if p≡1 mod3, gcd=1.
Therefore, in computing gcd(d,3n2), since d divides 3n2, and d is odd.
Let’s split into two subcases based on p mod3.
Subcase 1: p ≡0 or 2 mod3 (so p2 +p≡0 mod3):
Then gcd(d,3)=3, so d must divide 3n2, d is 3 times some divisor.
Let me write d=3d', so d'= (n2−4)/3.
Then d' divides n2.
But n and 3 are coprime?
Since n is odd, and 3 may or may not divide n.
Wait, n is odd, and p is part of n=2p+1, but p here is after assuming that p is such that n is odd.
Alternatively, perhaps this approach is getting too convoluted.
Let me try specific examples.
Let’s take n=5 (odd).
Then d=25−4=21.
Check if 21 divides 3n2=3*25=75?
21 divides75?
75 ÷21≈3.57, no.
So 21 doesn't divide75.
So a=3*25 /21=75/21=25/7, not integer.
n=5: no.
n=7 (odd).
d=49−4=45.
Does 45 divide3*49=147?
147 ÷45=3.266... No.
So a=3*49/45=147/15=49/5.
Not integer.
n=9.
d=81−4=77.
Divides3*81=243?
243 ÷77=3.15... No.
a=3*81/77=243/77.
Not integer.
Similarly, n=11.
d=121−4=117.
273 ÷117=2.333...
No.
Alternatively, n=odd and p= (n-1)/2.
For p=0 mod3.
If p=3, then n=2*3+1=7.
Which we tried, a= 3*49 /45=49/15, not integer.
If p=2 mod3.
For p=2, n=5, tried, not integer.
Alternatively, maybe n= some higher odd.
Alternatively, check divisors.
Since d=n2−4 must divide 3n2, and n is odd.
But n and d= n2−4 are coprime.
Because gcd(n, n2−4)= gcd(n, −4).
Since n is odd, gcd(n,−4)=1.
So n and d are coprime.
Therefore, d must divide 3.
Because d=n2−4 divides 3n2 and gcd(d,n2)=1, so d divides3.
Therefore, d=1 or 3.
So n2−4=1 →n2=5, no.
n2−4=3→n2=7, no.
So no solutions here.
Therefore, only possible when n is even, leading to case p=2, n=4, a=4.
Therefore, 4 is the only possible a, which is a positive integer.
Therefore, the minimal a is 4.
Thus, the answer is $\boxed{4}$.
**Final Answer**
The smallest possible value of \(a\) is \(\boxed{4}\).
</Think>

Answer: To solve the problem, we start by identifying the given geometric series \(4 + \frac{12}{a} + \frac{36}{a^2} + \cdots\). The first term \(a_1\) is 4, and the common ratio \(r\) is \(\frac{3}{a}\). For the series to converge, the common ratio must satisfy \(|r| < 1\), which implies \(\left|\frac{3}{a}\right| < 1\). Since \(a\) is a positive integer, we have \(\frac{3}{a} < 1\) or \(a > 3\).

The sum \(S\) of an infinite geometric series is given by \(S = \frac{\text{first term}}{1 - \text{common ratio}}\). Substituting the values, we get:
\[
S = \frac{4}{1 - \frac{3}{a}} = \frac{4a}{a - 3}
\]
We need this sum to be a perfect square. Let \(S = k^2\) for some integer \(k\). Thus, we have:
\[
\frac{4a}{a - 3} = k^2
\]
Rearranging this equation to solve for \(a\), we get:
\[
4a = k^2(a - 3) \implies 4a - k^2a + 3k^2 = 0 \implies a(4 - k^2) = -3k^2 \implies a = \frac{3k^2}{k^2 - 4}
\]
For \(a\) to be a positive integer, \(k^2 - 4\) must be a divisor of \(3k^2\). We analyze the cases where \(k\) is even and odd. 

For \(k\) even, let \(k = 2m\). Substituting \(k = 2m\) into the equation, we get:
\[
a = \frac{3(2m)^2}{(2m)^2 - 4} = \frac{12m^2}{4(m^2 - 1)} = \frac{3m^2}{m^2 - 1}
\]
For \(a\) to be an integer, \(m^2 - 1\) must divide \(3m^2\). The only solution occurs when \(m = 2\), leading to \(k = 4\) and:
\[
a = \frac{3 \cdot 4^2}{4^2 - 4} = \frac{48}{12} = 4
\]
For \(k\) odd, we find that \(k^2 - 4\) must divide 3, but no odd integer \(k > 2\) satisfies this condition. Thus, the only valid solution is \(a = 4\).

Verifying, the sum when \(a = 4\) is:
\[
S = \frac{4 \cdot 4}{4 - 3} = 16
\]
which is a perfect square. Therefore, the smallest possible value of \(a\) is \(\boxed{4}\).

the final answer is \boxed{4}

<think>
okay, so i need to solve this problem about a geometric series. let me read it again: the series is $4 + \frac{12}{a} + \frac{36}{a^2} + \cdots$, and we're told that the sum of this series is a perfect square. we need to find the smallest possible value of $a$, where $a$ is a positive integer.
alright, first, let's recall what a geometric series is. it's a series where each term after the first is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a constant ratio, right? so the general form is $s = \text{first term} + \text{first term} \times r + \text{first term} \times r^2 + \cdots$, where $r$ is the common ratio.
the sum of an infinite geometric series with |r| < 1 is given by $s = \frac{\text{first term}}{1 - r}$. so, for this series to converge, the common ratio must be between -1 and 1, not inclusive.
but in this problem, $a$ is a positive integer, so all terms are positive, and we need the common ratio to be between 0 and 1 so that the series converges.
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>
<goal>
<outline>
1: determine the common ratio of the given series.
</outline>
<outline>
2: determine the convergence condition for the series based on the common ratio.
</outline>
</goal>
<path>
1: the first term of the series is 4. the second term is 12/a, and the third term is 36/a². the common ratio, r, is found by dividing the second term by the first term. this calculation yields r = (12/a) / 4, which simplifies to r = 3/a.
</path>
<path>
2: the sum of the infinite geometric series is a perfect square. the series converges if the absolute value of the common ratio, |r|, is less than 1. since the common ratio r is positive (as 'a' is a positive integer), this convergence condition simplifies to r < 1, which is equivalent to 3/a < 1. the condition for convergence is that the common ratio r must be less than 1. given that r is positive, this implies 3/a < 1.
</path>
<conclusion>
the common ratio of the series is 3/a. the series converges if and only if the common ratio 3/a is less than 1, which is equivalent to the condition a > 3.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
therefore, $a$ must be greater than 3. since $a$ is a positive integer, the possible values for $a$ start from 4 upwards.
but we need the sum of the series to be a perfect square. so first, let's find the sum in terms of $a$.
the first term is 4, and the common ratio is $\frac{3}{a}$.
therefore, the sum $s$ is $\frac{4}{1 - \frac{3}{a}}$, provided that $\frac{3}{a} < 1$.
simplify the sum expression: s = 4 / (1 - 3/a) = 4 / ((a - 3)/a) = 4a/(a - 3).
so the sum $s = \frac{4a}{a - 3}$. this must be a perfect square.
we need to find the smallest positive integer $a > 3$ such that $\frac{4a}{a - 3}$ is a perfect square.
let me write that as an equation:
let $\frac{4a}{a - 3} = k^2$, where $k$ is a positive integer.
then solve for $a$ in terms of $k$:
multiply both sides by $(a - 3)$: $4a = k^2(a - 3)$
bring all terms to one side: $4a - k^2(a - 3) = 0$
expand: $4a - k^2a + 3k^2 = 0$
factor $a$: $a(4 - k^2) + 3k^2 = 0$
then, $a(4 - k^2) = -3k^2$
multiply both sides by -1: $a(k^2 - 4) = 3k^2$
therefore, $a = \frac{3k^2}{k^2 - 4}$
but $a$ must be a positive integer, so $k^2 - 4$ must divide $3k^2$.
moreover, since $a > 3$, as we concluded earlier from the convergence requirement, we have $\frac{3k^2}{k^2 - 4} > 3$
let me check that inequality:
$\frac{3k^2}{k^2 - 4} > 3$
dividing both sides by 3: $\frac{k^2}{k^2 - 4} > 1$
subtract 1 from both sides: $\frac{k^2 - (k^2 - 4)}{k^2 - 4} > 0 ⇒ \frac{4}{k^2 - 4} > 0$
which implies that $k^2 - 4 > 0 ⇒ k^2 > 4 ⇒ k > 2$, since $k$ is a positive integer.
therefore, $k ≥ 3$.
so $k$ starts from 3 upwards.
but we need $a = \frac{3k^2}{k^2 - 4}$ to be a positive integer.

wait, but maybe there's a better way than trial and error.
let me go back to the equation:
$a = \frac{3k^2}{k^2 - 4}$
for $a$ to be an integer, the denominator $k^2 - 4$ must divide $3k^2$.
since $k^2 - 4$ divides $3k^2$, let's write this as:
$k^2 - 4$ divides 3k2.
but since $k^2$ and $k^2 - 4$ are coprime except for possible common factors of 2.
because if a prime p divides $k^2$ and $k^2 - 4$, then p divides $(k^2 - 4) - k^2 = -4$.
therefore, the common prime factors can only be 2.
so let's factor out gcd(k2, k2 -4).
we have gcd(k2, k2 -4) = gcd(k2, 4).
if k is even, then gcd(k2,4) is 4 (if k is even, let k = 2m, then k2 = 4m2, so gcd(4m2,4)=4).
if k is odd, then gcd(k2,4)=1, since k2 is odd.
therefore, let's consider two cases: k even and k odd.
case 1: k is even.
let k = 2m.
then, k2 = 4m2, k2 -4 = 4(m2 -1).
substitute into the expression for a:
a = 3*(4m2) / (4(m2 -1)) ) = (12m2)/(4(m2 -1)) )= (3m2)/(m2 -1)
so for a to be integer, (m2 -1) must divide 3m2.
but m2 -1 divides 3m2.
let's write this as m2 -1 divides 3.
because m2 -1 and m2 are coprime.
because gcd(m2, m2 -1)=1.
therefore, gcd(m2 -1, m2)=1, so m2 -1 divides 3.
therefore, m2 -1 must be a divisor of 3.
the positive divisors of 3 are 1 and 3.
therefore, m2 -1=1 or m2 -1=3.
if m2 -1=1, then m2=2, which is not possible for integer m.
if m2 -1=3, then m2=4, so m=2.
therefore, only possible m=2.
therefore, k=2m=4.
then a = 3*(4)^2 / ( (4)^2 -4 )= 3*16 / (16 -4)=48 /12=4.
which we found earlier.
so when k is even, the only possible k is 4, which gives a=4.
case 2: k is odd.
let k be an odd positive integer greater than 2 (since k≥3).
then, gcd(k2, k2 -4)=1, as established earlier.
therefore, in this case, k2 -4 must divide 3k2, but since k2 -4 and k2 are coprime, it follows that k2 -4 divides 3.
therefore, k2 -4 must be a positive divisor of 3.
since k is odd and >=3, k2 -4 can be 3*1=3 (when k=√(3+4)=√7, not integer), or k2 -4=1, which would mean k2=5 (k=√5, not integer), or k2-4=3, which as above, not integer.
alternatively, perhaps considering k^2 -4 divides 3.
wait, k is odd and >=3, so k2 -4 is odd and >=5.
but 3 is a prime.
its positive divisors are 1 and 3.
but k2 -4 must divide 3, so k2 -4 =1 or 3.
if k2 -4=1, then k2=5, not integer.
if k2 -4=3, then k2=7, also not integer.
therefore, there are no solutions for odd k.
therefore, the only possible value is when k=4 (even), which gives a=4.
wait, but earlier when i tried k=5, which is odd, a was 75/21=25/7, which is not integer, as expected.
so according to this reasoning, the only possible a is 4.
but when k=4, we get a=4, which is a positive integer greater than 3, and the sum s= 4a/(a-3)=4*4/(4-3)=16/1=16, which is a perfect square.
so that works.
but earlier when trying k=5, which is not possible, and other even ks like k=6, which gave a non-integer a.
wait, but in case 1, when k is even, we concluded that the only possible m is 2, leading to k=4.
so that is the only solution.
but let me check for other possible m.
wait, we had that m must satisfy m2 -1 divides 3.
so d = m2 -1 must divide 3.
the divisors d>0 are 1 and 3.
so m2 -1=1 → m2=2, nope.
m2 -1=3 → m2=4, m=2.
so indeed, only m=2.
therefore, the only possible k is 4, leading to a=4.
therefore, the minimal a is 4.
but wait, the problem says "the smallest possible value of a where a is a positive integer".
so according to this, the answer is 4.
wait, but let's check if there could be other a values.
wait, in the case when we considered k even, and the expression simplifies, but for k odd, even though k2-4 would need to divide 3, but since k is odd, k2 -4 is ≡ (1 -4) mod 2 ≡ (-3) mod 2 ≡ 1 mod 2, so it's odd.
the divisors of 3 are 1 and 3, so as above.
so since m had to be such that m2 -1 divides 3, but m=2 gives the only viable k=4.
therefore, 4 is the minimal a.
but wait, when a=4, sum s=16, which is a perfect square.
so that works.
but let me check for other possible a.
suppose i didn't do the parametrization.
let me think again.
we have s = 4a/(a -3) must be a perfect square.
so 4a/(a -3) = n2 for some integer n.
then, rearranged: 4a = n2(a -3)
which is the same equation as before.
so, 4a = n2a - 3n2
bring all terms to one side: 4a - n2a + 3n2 =0
factor a: a(4 - n2) + 3n2 =0
so a= 3n2/(n2 -4).
same as before, with n being a positive integer greater than 2.
but previously, n would correspond to k in the previous notation.
but here, n is sqrt(s), so if s is a square, n is its square root.
but in any case, same equation.
so, same conclusion: for a to be integer, n^2 -4 must divide 3.
so n2 -4 divides 3.
therefore, n2 -4=1 or 3.
thus, n2=5 or 7, neither of which are squares.
unless... wait, but here n must be an integer, so n2 must be integer.
but n2 -4 divides 3 and n is integer.
so n2 -4 ∈ {1,3}.
so n2=5 or 7, which are not squares.
therefore, no solutions?
wait, but earlier with k=4, we had n=4.
wait, confusion between variables.
wait, when we set n as sqrt(s), then s=16 when a=4, so n=4.
but according to the equation, n2= 4a/(a-3).
if a=4, n2=4*4/(4-3)=16/1=16, so n=4.
so how does this reconcile with the previous?
ah, here n corresponds to k in previous steps.
wait, perhaps the problem is in considering n as any integer causing confusion.
let me rederive.
if s = 4a/(a -3) must be a perfect square, say s = m2 for integer m >=1.
then 4a/(a -3) = m2 ⇒ 4a = m2(a -3)
rearranging: 4a - m2 a + 3m2 =0 ⇒ a(4 -m2) +3m2 =0 ⇒ a = 3m2/(m2 -4)
same as before.
so here m is any positive integer such that m2 >4 (so m >=3), and m2 -4 divides 3m2.
but m is arbitrary?
wait, but again, m^2 -4 must divide 3m2.
since m2 and m2 -4 are coprime (since gcd(m2, m2 -4) divides 4).
but m2 -4 divides 3m2, and gcd(m2, m2 -4) divides 4, so m2 -4 must divide 3*(m2 -4) + 4*(something).
wait, perhaps another approach.
let d = m2 -4.
then d divides 3m2.
since d = m2 -4, m2 ≡ 4 mod d.
so 3m2 ≡ 12 ≡ 0 mod d.
therefore, d divides 12.
therefore, m2 -4 divides 12.
so m2 -4 must be a positive divisor of 12.
since m is integer, m >=3, so m2 -4 can be 5, 8, 9, 12, etc.
but m2 -4 divides 12, which has divisors 1,2,3,4,6,12.
so possible m2 -4 ∈ {1,2,3,4,6,12}.
therefore, m2 is in {5,6,7,8,10,16}.
but m must be integer >=3.
so m >=3 implies m2 >=9.
so among the possible m2 listed above, only 16 is greater than or equal to 9.
so m2=16, which implies m=4.
therefore, m=4.
then d = m2 -4 = 16 -4 =12.
so d divides 12, which is correct.
therefore, m=4.
then a= 3m2/(m2 -4) = 3*16 /12 = 48/12=4.
so the only m that works is m=4, leading to a=4.
therefore, 4 is the only possible a.
thus, the minimal a is 4.
but wait, the problem says "the smallest possible value of a where a is a positive integer".
so 4 is the answer.
but let me check.
wait, when a=4, the common ratio is 3/4, which is less than 1, so the series converges.
the sum is indeed 16, which is a perfect square.
perfect.
but is there another a leading to s being a perfect square?
suppose m2 -4 divides 12, but maybe m is not an integer.
wait, m must be integer, as it's the square root of s.
so if s is a perfect square, m is integer.
so m must be 4.
so a=4 is the only solution.
therefore, 4 is the smallest possible a.
hence, the answer is 4.
wait, but in my earlier trials, when i tried k=5, i got a=25/7≈3.57, which is not integer.
for k=6, a=27/8≈3.375, not integer.
k=7 gives a=3*49/(49−4)=147/45=49/15≈3.266, not integer.
k=8 gives a=3*(64)/(64−4)=192/60=16/5=3.2, not integer.
as k increases, a decreases towards 3, but since a must be >3 and integer, but all these values are fractional.
wait, but hang on, when k=4, which is even, m=2, gives a=4.
if m is 3, which would make k even as 2m=6, leading to a=27/8, not integer.
so seems like indeed only a=4 is possible.
alternatively, maybe there's a larger k where a is integer.
let me check k= some higher value.
suppose k= some value where k2−4 divides 3k2.
wait, but previously, through the reasoning, only k=4 gives valid answer.
alternatively, suppose n is some integer, and let's solve 4a/(a−3)=n2.
so 4a = n2(a−3)
rearranged: 4a = an2 −3n2
⇒ 4a −an2 = −3n2
⇒ a(4 −n2) = −3n2
⇒ a(n2 −4) =3n2
⇒ a= 3n2/(n2−4)
so, for a to be positive integer, n2 −4 divides 3n2.
let’s set d = n2 −4.
then d divides 3(n2).
but since d divides n2 (because d divides 3n2 and gcd(d, n2) = ?).
wait, let's compute gcd(d, n2).
since d = n2 −4, then gcd(d, n2) = gcd(n2 −4, n2) = gcd(4, n2).
because n2 ≡ 0 mod gcd(n2 −4, n2), and n2 = q*(n2 −4) + 4, so gcd(n2 −4, n2) = gcd(n2 −4, 4).
therefore, if n is even, then gcd(n2 −4,4)=4 (if n is even, n=2m, so n2=4m2, so n2−4=4m2−4=4(m2−1), so gcd(4(m2−1),4)=4).
if n is odd, then gcd(n2 −4,4)= gcd(odd − even,4)= gcd(odd,4)=1.
therefore, two cases:
case 1: n even.
let n=2p.
then d = (2p)^2 −4 =4p2 −4=4(p2 −1).
then, since d=4(p2 −1), and 3n2=3*4p2=12p2.
therefore, d divides 12p2 ⇒ 4(p2 −1) divides 12p2 ⇒ (p2 −1) divides 3p2.
but (p2 −1) and p2 are coprime, since consecutive integers.
so gcd(p2 −1, p2)=1.
therefore, p2 −1 divides 3.
therefore, p2 −1=1 or 3.
if p2 −1=1, then p2=2, no integer p.
if p2 −1=3, then p2=4, p=2.
therefore, only possible p=2.
therefore, n=2p=4, leading to a=3*42/(42−4)=3*16/12=48/12=4.
so that's the same as before.
case 2: n is odd.
then d= n2 −4, and 3n2 must be divisible by d.
since n is odd, d = n2 −4 ≡ 1 − 0 ≡1 mod 2 (odd).
gcd(d,3n2)= gcd(n2−4, 3n2).
since n is odd, let's compute gcd(n2−4,3).
since n is odd, n=2p+1, n2=4p2 +4p +1.
so n2−4=4p2 +4p +1 −4=4p2 +4p −3.
therefore, gcd(4p2 +4p −3,3).
since 4p2 +4p −3 ≡ (1)p2 +1p −0 ≡ p2 +p mod 3.
therefore, gcd(4p2 +4p −3,3)= gcd(p2 +p,3).
since p can be 0,1,2 mod3.
if p=0 mod3: then p=3q, then p2 +p=9q2 +3q≡0 mod3.
if p=1 mod3: p=3q+1, p2 +p=9q2 +6q +1 +3q +1=9q2 +9q +2≡2 mod3.
if p=2 mod3: p=3q+2, p2 +p=9q2 +12q +4 +3q +2=9q2 +15q +6≡0 mod3.
therefore, if p ≡0 or 2 mod3, then gcd(p2 +p,3)=3, else if p≡1 mod3, gcd=1.
therefore, in computing gcd(d,3n2), since d divides 3n2, and d is odd.
let’s split into two subcases based on p mod3.
subcase 1: p ≡0 or 2 mod3 (so p2 +p≡0 mod3):
then gcd(d,3)=3, so d must divide 3n2, d is 3 times some divisor.
let me write d=3d', so d'= (n2−4)/3.
then d' divides n2.
but n and 3 are coprime?
since n is odd, and 3 may or may not divide n.
wait, n is odd, and p is part of n=2p+1, but p here is after assuming that p is such that n is odd.
alternatively, perhaps this approach is getting too convoluted.
let me try specific examples.
let’s take n=5 (odd).
then d=25−4=21.
check if 21 divides 3n2=3*25=75?
21 divides75?
75 ÷21≈3.57, no.
so 21 doesn't divide75.
so a=3*25 /21=75/21=25/7, not integer.
n=5: no.
n=7 (odd).
d=49−4=45.
does 45 divide3*49=147?
147 ÷45=3.266... no.
so a=3*49/45=147/15=49/5.
not integer.
n=9.
d=81−4=77.
divides3*81=243?
243 ÷77=3.15... no.
a=3*81/77=243/77.
not integer.
similarly, n=11.
d=121−4=117.
273 ÷117=2.333...
no.
alternatively, n=odd and p= (n-1)/2.
for p=0 mod3.
if p=3, then n=2*3+1=7.
which we tried, a= 3*49 /45=49/15, not integer.
if p=2 mod3.
for p=2, n=5, tried, not integer.
alternatively, maybe n= some higher odd.
alternatively, check divisors.
since d=n2−4 must divide 3n2, and n is odd.
but n and d= n2−4 are coprime.
because gcd(n, n2−4)= gcd(n, −4).
since n is odd, gcd(n,−4)=1.
so n and d are coprime.
therefore, d must divide 3.
because d=n2−4 divides 3n2 and gcd(d,n2)=1, so d divides3.
therefore, d=1 or 3.
so n2−4=1 →n2=5, no.
n2−4=3→n2=7, no.
so no solutions here.
therefore, only possible when n is even, leading to case p=2, n=4, a=4.
therefore, 4 is the only possible a, which is a positive integer.
therefore, the minimal a is 4.
thus, the answer is $\boxed{4}$.
**final answer**
the smallest possible value of \(a\) is \(\boxed{4}\).

answer: to solve the problem, we start by identifying the given geometric series \(4 + \frac{12}{a} + \frac{36}{a^2} + \cdots\). the first term \(a_1\) is 4, and the common ratio \(r\) is \(\frac{3}{a}\). for the series to converge, the common ratio must satisfy \(|r| < 1\), which implies \(\left|\frac{3}{a}\right| < 1\). since \(a\) is a positive integer, we have \(\frac{3}{a} < 1\) or \(a > 3\).

the sum \(s\) of an infinite geometric series is given by \(s = \frac{\text{first term}}{1 - \text{common ratio}}\). substituting the values, we get:
\[
s = \frac{4}{1 - \frac{3}{a}} = \frac{4a}{a - 3}
\]
we need this sum to be a perfect square. let \(s = k^2\) for some integer \(k\). thus, we have:
\[
\frac{4a}{a - 3} = k^2
\]
rearranging this equation to solve for \(a\), we get:
\[
4a = k^2(a - 3) \implies 4a - k^2a + 3k^2 = 0 \implies a(4 - k^2) = -3k^2 \implies a = \frac{3k^2}{k^2 - 4}
\]
for \(a\) to be a positive integer, \(k^2 - 4\) must be a divisor of \(3k^2\). we analyze the cases where \(k\) is even and odd. 

for \(k\) even, let \(k = 2m\). substituting \(k = 2m\) into the equation, we get:
\[
a = \frac{3(2m)^2}{(2m)^2 - 4} = \frac{12m^2}{4(m^2 - 1)} = \frac{3m^2}{m^2 - 1}
\]
for \(a\) to be an integer, \(m^2 - 1\) must divide \(3m^2\). the only solution occurs when \(m = 2\), leading to \(k = 4\) and:
\[
a = \frac{3 \cdot 4^2}{4^2 - 4} = \frac{48}{12} = 4
\]
for \(k\) odd, we find that \(k^2 - 4\) must divide 3, but no odd integer \(k > 2\) satisfies this condition. thus, the only valid solution is \(a = 4\).

verifying, the sum when \(a = 4\) is:
\[
s = \frac{4 \cdot 4}{4 - 3} = 16
\]
which is a perfect square. therefore, the smallest possible value of \(a\) is \(\boxed{4}\).

the final answer is \boxed{4}
