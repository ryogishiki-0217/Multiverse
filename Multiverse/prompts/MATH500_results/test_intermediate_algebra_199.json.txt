<Think>
Okay, so I need to find the quotient when x9 + 1 is divided by x - 1.
Hmm, division of polynomials.
I think I can use either long division or synthetic division here.
But wait, synthetic division is easier when the divisor is a linear polynomial with a monic variable term.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: Determine if the divisor is linear.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: Determine if the divisor is monic.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The divisor x - 1 is identified as a linear polynomial.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The divisor x - 1 is checked for being monic. The polynomial x - 1 is confirmed as monic because its leading coefficient is 1.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The divisor x - 1 is both linear and monic.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So synthetic division is a good option here.
But before I jump into that, I remember that there's a theorem called the Remainder Theorem or maybe the Factor Theorem related to polynomial division.
Let me recall.
The Remainder Theorem says that if you divide a polynomial f(x) by x - c, the remainder is f(c).
But here, we're dividing x9 + 1 by x - 1, so the remainder should be f(1) where f(x) = x9 + 1.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: The remainder of the division.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: The confirmation of the remainder being zero.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The remainder is determined by evaluating f(1) = 1^9 + 1, which results in 2.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The remainder being zero confirms that x - 1 is a factor of x9 + 1.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The remainder of the division is 2, and consequently, x - 1 is not a factor of x9 + 1.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Wait, but the problem says "find the quotient", so the remainder is 2, which would mean when we divide x9 + 1 by x - 1, we get a quotient Q(x) such that x9 + 1 = (x - 1)Q(x) + 2.
But since we need the quotient, perhaps the problem expects the division to go through completely?
Wait, maybe the problem is in the context where even if there's a remainder, we just need the quotient part?
Let me check that.
The problem says "Find the quotient when x9 + 1 is divided by x - 1."
So, even though there's a remainder, the quotient is the polynomial part of the division.
So, for example, if you were to do polynomial division, the quotient would be a polynomial of degree 8 (since x9 divided by x gives x8, and the division would reduce the degree by 1 each step), and the remainder would be 2 as found.
So, the answer should be the quotient polynomial.
Therefore, to find it, I can use either long division or synthetic division.
Let me decide.
Since the divisor is x - 1, synthetic division is faster.

1: The divisor x - 1 is used with a root of 1 for synthetic division. The dividend polynomial is x^9 + 1, which is equivalent to x^9 + 0x^8 + 0x^7 + 0x^6 + 0x^5 + 0x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x + 1. The coefficients for the dividend are [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1].
</Path>
<Path>
2: The first coefficient of the quotient is determined to be 1. The first multiplication involves 1 multiplied by 1, yielding 1. This initial product is positioned below the subsequent coefficient, which is 0. The first addition step involves summing 0 and 1, resulting in 1.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
Synthetic division is performed using a root of 1 and the coefficient list [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1] for the dividend x^9 + 1. The initial coefficient of the quotient is 1, and the first multiplication step (1 * 1) yields 1, which is then added to the next coefficient (0 + 1) to obtain the next coefficient of the quotient, 1.

1: The remainder obtained from synthetic division is 2. The Remainder Theorem states that the remainder of the division of f(x) by x - c is f(c). For the polynomial f(x) = x^9 + 1 and the divisor x - 1, where c = 1, the remainder is calculated as f(1) = 1^9 + 1 = 2. The result from the Remainder Theorem, 2, matches the remainder obtained from the synthetic division.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The obtained quotient polynomial is verified by multiplying it by (x - 1) and adding the remainder. The product of (x - 1) and the quotient x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 is calculated as x*(x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1) - (x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1) = x^9 + x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x - x^8 - x^7 - x^6 - x^5 - x^4 - x^3 - x^2 - x - 1. The terms x^8, x^7, x^6, x^5, x^4, x^3, x^2, and x cancel out. The resulting sum is x^9 - 1. Adding the remainder 2 to this sum yields x^9 - 1 + 2 = x^9 + 1, which confirms the original dividend.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The remainder obtained from synthetic division is confirmed as 2, consistent with the Remainder Theorem. The quotient polynomial, when multiplied by (x - 1) and the remainder is added, correctly reconstructs the original dividend x^9 + 1.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Therefore, the quotient is x8 + x7 + x6 + x5 + x4 + x3 + x2 + x + 1, and the remainder is 2.
But the problem asks for the quotient, so that should be the answer.
Alternatively, maybe there is a way to express this using summation notation.
Since all the coefficients are 1, it's the sum from k=0 to 8 of x^k.
Yes, that's another way to write it.
So the quotient is the sum of x^k from k=0 to 8.
But maybe the problem expects the expanded form.
Hmm.
The problem doesn't specify, so either way is acceptable.
But since in the original problem, the dividend is x9 + 1 and the divisor is x - 1, and performing the division gives the quotient as the 8th degree polynomial with all ones.
Therefore, writing it out term by term might be expected, but perhaps using sigma notation is okay too.
But since the instructions say "solve the following math problem" and present the question as stated, I should check the answer format.
But the original problem is to "Find the quotient when x9 + 1 is divided by x - 1."
So, the answer is the quotient, which is that 8th-degree polynomial.
Therefore, I can write it either in expanded form or using summation notation.
Let me check if there's a standard formula here.
Wait, if we have x^n - 1 divided by x - 1, the quotient is the sum of x^{k} from k=0 to n-1.
But here, the dividend is x9 + 1.
But if we write x9 + 1 as x9 - (-1), so maybe it's related to the factorization of sums of powers.
For example, x^n + 1 is divisible by x + 1 if n is odd.
But here, n is 9, which is odd, so x^9 + 1 is divisible by x + 1, not by x - 1.
So, when dividing by x - 1, we get a remainder, which is what we saw.
But in any case, the quotient is as we found.
Alternatively, is there another method?
Maybe using the fact that dividing by x - 1, the quotient can be found using the relationship between the coefficients.
Alternatively, note that if we let f(x) = x9 + 1, then the division by x - 1 gives f(x) = (x - 1)Q(x) + R, where R is the remainder.
Since the divisor is degree 1, the remainder is a constant.
We found Q(x) and R using synthetic division.
Alternatively, to find Q(x), we can note that Q(x) is the derivative of some function related to f(x), but I don't think so.
Alternatively, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series.
Wait, since (x - 1)Q(x) + R = x9 + 1.
If we consider that (x - 1)Q(x) is equal to x9 + 1 - R = x9 - 1 + (1 + R).
Wait, perhaps not.
Alternatively, since we know that R = 2, then (x - 1)Q(x) = x9 + 1 - 2 = x9 - 1.
Wait, x9 - 1 is divisible by x - 1, right?
Let's think in parallel.

<Conclusion>
The polynomial x^9 - 1 is divisible by x - 1, whereas x^9 + 1 is not.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Therefore, in our case, x9 + 1 = (x - 1)Q(x) + 2.
Therefore, (x - 1)Q(x) = x9 + 1 - 2 = x9 - 1.
Therefore, Q(x) = (x9 - 1)/(x - 1).
But (x9 - 1)/(x - 1) is the sum from k=0 to 8 of x^k.
So that's the polynomial we found: x8 + x7 + ... + 1.
Therefore, this confirms our previous result.
Therefore, the quotient is indeed Q(x) = x8 + x7 + x6 + x5 + x4 + x3 + x2 + x + 1.
So this is correct.
Alternatively, maybe writing it as Q(x) = (x9 - 1)/(x - 1) is a valid representation, but the problem says "Find the quotient", so they might expect the explicit polynomial written out.
But since it's a finite sum, writing it as the sum from k=0 to 8 of x^k is also acceptable, but maybe they want the terms written explicitly.
Let me check the original problem again.
The original problem is: "Find the quotient when x9 + 1 is divided by x - 1."
So the problem is asking for the quotient, which is the polynomial Q(x) such that x9 + 1 = (x - 1)Q(x) + R, where R is the remainder.
We found Q(x) through synthetic division, and also confirmed that (x - 1)Q(x) = x9 - 1, so Q(x) is (x9 - 1)/(x - 1), which is the 8th-degree polynomial with all coefficients 1.
Therefore, the answer is Q(x) = x8 + x7 + x6 + x5 + x4 + x3 + x2 + x + 1.
To write this out in a box as requested:
the final answer is x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1
**Final Answer** 
The final answer is \boxed{x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1}.

Answer: To find the quotient when \( x^9 + 1 \) is divided by \( x - 1 \), we can use synthetic division. 

1. **Set up the synthetic division**: Since we are dividing by \( x - 1 \), the root is \( 1 \). The coefficients of the dividend \( x^9 + 1 \) are \( 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1 \).

2. **Perform the synthetic division**:
   - Bring down the leading coefficient \( 1 \).
   - Multiply \( 1 \) by \( 1 \) and add to the next coefficient, repeating this process for all coefficients.

3. **Result of synthetic division**:
   - The coefficients of the quotient are \( 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 \), and the remainder is \( 2 \).

4. **Form the quotient polynomial**: The coefficients \( 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 \) correspond to the polynomial \( x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 \).

5. **Verification**: Multiply the quotient by \( x - 1 \) and add the remainder \( 2 \) to confirm it equals the original dividend \( x^9 + 1 \).

Thus, the quotient when \( x^9 + 1 \) is divided by \( x - 1 \) is \(\boxed{x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1}\).<Path>
2: The expression x^9 + 1 is factored in the same straightforward manner as x^9 - 1.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The final answer is \boxed{x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1}.

wait, perhaps not.

therefore, in our case, x9 + 1 = (x - 1)q(x) + 2.

therefore, q(x) = (x9 - 1)/(x - 1).
but (x9 - 1)/(x - 1) is the sum from k=0 to 8 of x^k.
so that's the polynomial we found: x8 + x7 + ... + 1.

but since it's a finite sum, writing it as the sum from k=0 to 8 of x^k is also acceptable, but maybe they want the terms written explicitly.
let me check the original problem again.
the original problem is: "find the quotient when x9 + 1 is divided by x - 1."
so the problem is asking for the quotient, which is the polynomial q(x) such that x9 + 1 = (x - 1)q(x) + r, where r is the remainder.
we found q(x) through synthetic division, and also confirmed that (x - 1)q(x) = x9 - 1, so q(x) is (x9 - 1)/(x - 1), which is the 8th-degree polynomial with all coefficients 1.
therefore, the answer is q(x) = x8 + x7 + x6 + x5 + x4 + x3 + x2 + x + 1.
to write this out in a box as requested:
the final answer is x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1
**final answer** 
the final answer is \boxed{x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1}.

answer: to find the quotient when \( x^9 + 1 \) is divided by \( x - 1 \), we can use synthetic division. 

1. **set up the synthetic division**: since we are dividing by \( x - 1 \), the root is \( 1 \). the coefficients of the dividend \( x^9 + 1 \) are \( 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1 \).

2. **perform the synthetic division**:
   - bring down the leading coefficient \( 1 \).
   - multiply \( 1 \) by \( 1 \) and add to the next coefficient, repeating this process for all coefficients.

3. **result of synthetic division**:
   - the coefficients of the quotient are \( 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 \), and the remainder is \( 2 \).

4. **form the quotient polynomial**: the coefficients \( 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 \) correspond to the polynomial \( x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 \).

5. **verification**: multiply the quotient by \( x - 1 \) and add the remainder \( 2 \) to confirm it equals the original dividend \( x^9 + 1 \).

thus, the quotient when \( x^9 + 1 \) is divided by \( x - 1 \) is \(\boxed{x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1}\).<path>
2: the expression x^9 + 1 is factored in the same straightforward manner as x^9 - 1.
