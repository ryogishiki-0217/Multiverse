<Think>
Okay, so I need to find the quotient when x9 + 1 is divided by x - 1.
Let me think about how to approach this.
There's probably a few methods I can use here.
Let's see.
First, I remember that for dividing polynomials, we can use long division.
But that might be a bit tedious for this problem since the degree of the dividend is 9.
That would involve dividing step by step, multiplying, subtracting, bringing down terms.
It could get messy, but maybe it's doable.
Alternatively, there's synthetic division.
Wait, synthetic division is used when dividing by a linear factor of the form x - c.
Here, we're dividing by x - 1, so that is in the correct form.
That might be easier than long division.
Let me recall how synthetic division works.
We use the root of the divisor, which is x = 1 in this case, and then use the coefficients of the dividend.
But let's make sure.
The dividend is x9 + 1.
So in standard form, that's 1x9 + 0x8 + 0x7 + ... + 0x + 1.
Because all the other terms from x8 down to x are zero.
So if we were to set up synthetic division, we'd use 1 (the root) and the coefficients: 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.
But that seems like a lot of steps.
Let me remember that synthetic division will require adding the root multiplied by the coefficients to the next coefficients sequentially.
But with so many zeros, maybe a pattern will emerge.
Let's try.
In synthetic division, we take the coefficients of the dividend, starting with the leading coefficient, which is 1.
Then we bring down the 1.
Multiply by 1 (the root), which stays 1, and add to the next coefficient (which is 0).
So 0 + 1 = 1.
Then take that 1, multiply by 1, get 1, add to the next coefficient (0 again).
So 0 + 1 = 1.
Hmm, maybe a pattern here.
Each time, adding 1.
So let's see, let's map this out:
Bring down the first coefficient: 1.
Then:
First iteration: 1 * 1 = 1, add to next coefficient (0): total 1.
Second iteration: 1 * 1 = 1, add to next coefficient (0): total 1.
Third iteration: same thing.
Wait, but this would continue until the last coefficient.
Wait, but the last coefficient is 1.
So when we get to the last coefficient, which is the constant term, we add 1 to it.
So the remainder should be 2?
Wait, because the remainder is the last value added.
Wait, let's be careful here.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: Determine the number of rows and columns in the synthetic division setup.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: Determine the first coefficient to be brought down and the root value.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The degree of the dividend x^9 + 1 is 9, resulting in 10 coefficients. Consequently, the synthetic division setup will consist of 10 rows and 11 columns.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The first coefficient, 1, is brought down, and the root value is 1.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The synthetic division setup will have 10 rows and 11 columns, with the first coefficient 1 being brought down and the root value 1.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
First coefficient: 1.
Then each subsequent coefficient is 0 until the last one, which is 1.
So let's imagine the process:
Coefficients: 1 | 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
Bring down the 1.
Then:
1 * 1 = 1 → add to next coefficient (0 + 1 = 1)
1 * 1 = 1 → add to next coefficient (0 + 1 = 1)
Continue this 7 more times:
Coefficients become 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1.
Then we have the last coefficient, which is 1.
Adding the value from the previous step (1) to this last coefficient: 1 + 1 = 2.
So the remainder is 2.
But the division should be x9 + 1 = (x - 1)(quotient) + remainder.
So if the remainder is 2, then:
x9 + 1 = (x - 1)(quotient) + 2
Therefore, (x9 + 1) - 2 = (x - 1)(quotient)
So x9 - 1 = (x - 1)(quotient) - 1?
Wait, that doesn't make sense.
Wait, maybe I messed up the synthetic division.
Wait, maybe I need to check again.
Wait, perhaps another approach.
Let me recall that if we divide f(x) by (x - c), the remainder is f(c).
So if we divide x9 + 1 by x - 1, the remainder should be f(1) = 19 + 1 = 2.
So that is correct.
So according to the division algorithm, we have:
Dividend = (Divisor)(Quotient) + Remainder
So:
x9 + 1 = (x - 1)(Q(x)) + 2
Therefore, if we rearrange, (x9 + 1) - 2 = (x - 1)(Q(x))
So x9 - 1 = (x - 1)(Q(x))
Wait, but x9 - 1 is a difference of ninth powers.
Wait, actually, x9 - 1 can be factored as (x - 1)(x8 + x7 + x6 + ... + x + 1).
Wait, is that correct?
Let me think.
Yes, for a^n - b^n = (a - b)(a^{n-1} + a^{n-2}b + ... + ab^{n-2} + b^{n-1}).
So if we have x9 - 1, that's (x)^9 - (1)^9, so it factors as (x - 1)(x8 + x7 + x6 + x5 + x4 + x3 + x2 + x + 1).
Therefore, Q(x) would be x8 + x7 + x6 + x5 + x4 + x3 + x2 + x + 1, right?
But then in our previous equation:
x9 + 1 = (x - 1)(Q(x)) + 2
So if Q(x) is x8 + x7 + x6 + x5 + x4 + x3 + x2 + x + 1, then (x - 1) times Q(x) is x9 - 1.
Therefore:
(x - 1)(Q(x)) = x9 - 1
Therefore, x9 +1 = (x9 -1) + 2, which is correct.
Hence, x9 + 1 = (x -1)(Q(x)) + 2, so the quotient is Q(x) and the remainder is 2.
Therefore, when we divide x9 +1 by x -1, the quotient is x8 +x7 +x6 +x5 +x4 +x3 +x2 +x +1, and the remainder is 2.
But the problem asks only for the quotient, so the answer should be that sum of powers of x from 8 down to 0.
Wait, but hold on.
Let me verify with the synthetic division again.
If we perform synthetic division of x9 +1 by x -1, then as I started earlier, the coefficients would be all 1s because each step you multiply the previous coefficient (which is 1) by 1 (the root) and add to the next coefficient (which is 0).
So:
Coefficients:
1 | 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
Bring down 1:
1
Multiply by 1:
1
Add to next coefficient (0):
1
Multiply by 1:
1
Add to next coefficient (0):
1
...
Continue until the last coefficient.
So each coefficient in the quotient is 1, and the remainder is 1 + 1 = 2.
Therefore, the quotient is x8 + x7 + x6 + x5 + x4 + x3 + x2 + x + 1 and remainder 2.
Therefore, that's consistent with the factorization of x9 -1.
Therefore, the quotient is the sum of powers from x8 down to x0 with coefficients 1.
Therefore, the answer is x8 + x7 + x6 + x5 + x4 + x3 + x2 + x + 1.
Wait, but just to make sure, let's check the degrees.
The dividend is degree 9, divisor is degree 1, so the quotient should be degree 8, which this is, and the remainder is a constant, which is correct.
So that seems right.
Alternatively, another approach: polynomial long division.
Let me try dividing x9 +1 by x -1 using long division to confirm.
Set up the division:
____________
x -1 | x9 +0x8 +0x7 +0x6 +0x5 +0x4 +0x3 +0x2 +0x +1
First, divide x9 by x, get x8.
Multiply the divisor (x -1) by x8: x9 - x8
Subtract from the dividend:
(x9 +0x8 + ... ) - (x9 - x8) = 0x9 + x8 + ... = x8 + ...
Bring down the next term, which is 0x7.
So now we have x8 - x7?
Wait, no, actually, wait, let me do that step again.
After subtracting x9 - x8, we have:
0x9 + x8 + 0x7 +0x6...
So the next term is x8.
Divide x8 by x, get x7.
Multiply divisor by x7: x8 - x7
Subtract from the current polynomial:
(x8 +0x7 +...) - (x8 - x7) = 0x8 + x7 + ...
Bring down the next term, which is 0x6.
So now we have x7 - x6?
Wait, actually:
After subtraction, we have x7 +0x6 +..., so bringing down the next term is 0x6.
So repeating this step each time, dividing the leading term by x gives the next term in the quotient, which is x7, then x6, etc., each time subtracting (term * (x -1)) from the remaining polynomial.
Each step, the coefficient seems to be 1.
Let's see:
First term: x8
Second: x7
Third: x6
Continuing this way, each time the next term will be x^n where n decreases by 1 each time, and the coefficient is 1, because when you subtract (x^{k+1} - x^k), you get x^k, which then divided by x gives x^{k-1}, so the coefficient remains 1.
So after 8 steps, we would have terms x8 +x7 +x6 +x5 +x4 +x3 +x2 +x +1, and the remainder when dividing?
Let me check.
After the last subtraction, what's left?
The original polynomial was x9 +0x8 +... +0x +1
After performing the division, each step removes up to the next lower degree term, but all the terms we had in between were zero except the constant term 1.
So when we get to the constant term, we have:
Quotient so far: x8 +x7 +x6 +x5 +x4 +x3 +x2 +x +1
Multiply this by (x -1):
(x9 -x8) + (x8 -x7) + (x7 -x6) + ... + (x -1)
Notice that this telescopes:
x9 - x8 + x8 - x7 + x7 - x6 + ... + x -1
All the intermediate terms cancel, leaving x9 -1
Therefore, (x8 +x7 +x6 +x5 +x4 +x3 +x2 +x +1)(x -1) = x9 -1
But our original dividend is x9 +1, so if we have x9 +1, then:
x9 +1 = (x9 -1) + 2
Therefore, when divided by (x -1), the quotient is the polynomial above, x8 +x7 +x6 +x5 +x4 +x3 +x2 +x +1, and the remainder is 2.
Hence, the division gives Quotient = x8 +x7 +x6 +x5 +x4 +x3 +x2 +x +1, Remainder = 2.
Therefore, the answer should be that quotient.
So I think that's correct.
So the quotient is x8 + x7 + x6 + x5 + x4 + x3 + x2 + x + 1.
Wait, but just to make sure, let's check the sum of that geometric series.
The quotient is the sum from k=0 to 8 of x^k.
So if we have the sum of x^8 + x^7 + ... + x +1, that is indeed the sum of a geometric series with ratio x, 9 terms.
The formula for the sum is (x^9 - 1)/(x - 1).
Wait, but actually, the sum from k=0 to n-1 of x^k is (x^n - 1)/(x - 1).
Here, n would be 9, so sum from k=0 to 8 of x^k is (x^9 - 1)/(x -1).
But in our case, when we divide x^9 +1 by x -1, the quotient is that sum plus a remainder of 2.
Wait, but wait, (x^9 - 1)/(x -1) is exactly that sum.
So x^9 -1 = (x -1)*(sum from k=0 to 8 x^k).
So then, since our polynomial is x^9 +1, that's equal to (x^9 -1) + 2.
Hence, dividing by (x -1), we get (x^9 -1)/(x -1) + 2/(x -1).
So the quotient is (x^9 -1)/(x -1) which is the sum, and the remainder is 2 as the remainder term.
Therefore, quotient is sum from k=0 to8 x^k, which is x^8 +x^7 +...+x+1.
Perfect, that confirms it.
Therefore, I'm confident that the quotient is x8 +x7 +x6 +x5 +x4 +x3 +x2 +x +1.
So the problem is solved.
Wait, just to make extra sure, let's check with a small example.
Suppose we have x2 +1 divided by x -1.
The quotient should be x +1 with remainder 2, because (x -1)(x +1) = x2 -1, and x2 +1 = (x2 -1) +2.
So quotient is x +1, remainder 2.
Similarly, in our case, when we divide x9 +1 by x -1, the quotient is the sum of x^k from 0 to8, and remainder 2.
The pattern is similar.
Therefore, this makes sense.
Therefore, the answer should be x8 +x7 +x6 +x5 +x4 +x3 +x2 +x +1.
But let me check once more.
If I take the quotient, x8 +x7 +x6 +x5 +x4 +x3 +x2 +x +1, multiply by (x -1), what do I get?
(x8 +x7 +x6 +x5 +x4 +x3 +x2 +x +1)(x -1) =
x9 +x8 +x7 +x6 +x5 +x4 +x3 +x2 +x
-
x8 +x7 +x6 +x5 +x4 +x3 +x2 +x +1
= x9 - 1
Which is correct, so that difference gives x9 -1.
Then since our original polynomial is x9 +1, which is (x9 -1) +2, so when divided by (x -1), the quotient is the sum (x8 + ... +1) and the remainder is 2.
Therefore, that's all correct.
So the problem is asking for the quotient, which is the sum of powers from x8 down to x0, each with coefficient 1.
Hence, the final answer is x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1.
**Final Answer**
\boxed{x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1}
</Think>

Answer: To find the quotient when \( x^9 + 1 \) is divided by \( x - 1 \), we can use the fact that \( x^n - 1 \) can be factored as \( (x - 1)(x^{n-1} + x^{n-2} + \cdots + x + 1) \). 

Given the polynomial \( x^9 + 1 \), we can express it as:
\[
x^9 + 1 = (x^9 - 1) + 2
\]
We know that \( x^9 - 1 \) factors as:
\[
x^9 - 1 = (x - 1)(x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1)
\]
Thus, substituting back, we get:
\[
x^9 + 1 = (x - 1)(x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1) + 2
\]
This shows that the quotient when \( x^9 + 1 \) is divided by \( x - 1 \) is \( x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 \) and the remainder is 2. 

Therefore, the quotient is:
\[
\boxed{x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1}
\]

<think>
okay, so i need to find the quotient when x9 + 1 is divided by x - 1.
let me think about how to approach this.
there's probably a few methods i can use here.
let's see.
first, i remember that for dividing polynomials, we can use long division.
but that might be a bit tedious for this problem since the degree of the dividend is 9.
that would involve dividing step by step, multiplying, subtracting, bringing down terms.
it could get messy, but maybe it's doable.
alternatively, there's synthetic division.
wait, synthetic division is used when dividing by a linear factor of the form x - c.
here, we're dividing by x - 1, so that is in the correct form.
that might be easier than long division.
let me recall how synthetic division works.
we use the root of the divisor, which is x = 1 in this case, and then use the coefficients of the dividend.
but let's make sure.
the dividend is x9 + 1.
so in standard form, that's 1x9 + 0x8 + 0x7 + ... + 0x + 1.
because all the other terms from x8 down to x are zero.
so if we were to set up synthetic division, we'd use 1 (the root) and the coefficients: 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.
but that seems like a lot of steps.
let me remember that synthetic division will require adding the root multiplied by the coefficients to the next coefficients sequentially.
but with so many zeros, maybe a pattern will emerge.
let's try.
in synthetic division, we take the coefficients of the dividend, starting with the leading coefficient, which is 1.
then we bring down the 1.
multiply by 1 (the root), which stays 1, and add to the next coefficient (which is 0).
so 0 + 1 = 1.
then take that 1, multiply by 1, get 1, add to the next coefficient (0 again).
so 0 + 1 = 1.
hmm, maybe a pattern here.
each time, adding 1.
so let's see, let's map this out:
bring down the first coefficient: 1.
then:
first iteration: 1 * 1 = 1, add to next coefficient (0): total 1.
second iteration: 1 * 1 = 1, add to next coefficient (0): total 1.
third iteration: same thing.
wait, but this would continue until the last coefficient.
wait, but the last coefficient is 1.
so when we get to the last coefficient, which is the constant term, we add 1 to it.
so the remainder should be 2?
wait, because the remainder is the last value added.
wait, let's be careful here.
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>
<goal>
<outline>
1: determine the number of rows and columns in the synthetic division setup.
</outline>
<outline>
2: determine the first coefficient to be brought down and the root value.
</outline>
</goal>
<path>
1: the degree of the dividend x^9 + 1 is 9, resulting in 10 coefficients. consequently, the synthetic division setup will consist of 10 rows and 11 columns.
</path>
<path>
2: the first coefficient, 1, is brought down, and the root value is 1.
</path>
<conclusion>
the synthetic division setup will have 10 rows and 11 columns, with the first coefficient 1 being brought down and the root value 1.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
first coefficient: 1.
then each subsequent coefficient is 0 until the last one, which is 1.
so let's imagine the process:
coefficients: 1 | 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
bring down the 1.
then:
1 * 1 = 1 → add to next coefficient (0 + 1 = 1)
1 * 1 = 1 → add to next coefficient (0 + 1 = 1)
continue this 7 more times:
coefficients become 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1.
then we have the last coefficient, which is 1.
adding the value from the previous step (1) to this last coefficient: 1 + 1 = 2.
so the remainder is 2.
but the division should be x9 + 1 = (x - 1)(quotient) + remainder.
so if the remainder is 2, then:
x9 + 1 = (x - 1)(quotient) + 2
therefore, (x9 + 1) - 2 = (x - 1)(quotient)
so x9 - 1 = (x - 1)(quotient) - 1?
wait, that doesn't make sense.
wait, maybe i messed up the synthetic division.
wait, maybe i need to check again.
wait, perhaps another approach.
let me recall that if we divide f(x) by (x - c), the remainder is f(c).
so if we divide x9 + 1 by x - 1, the remainder should be f(1) = 19 + 1 = 2.
so that is correct.
so according to the division algorithm, we have:
dividend = (divisor)(quotient) + remainder
so:
x9 + 1 = (x - 1)(q(x)) + 2
therefore, if we rearrange, (x9 + 1) - 2 = (x - 1)(q(x))
so x9 - 1 = (x - 1)(q(x))
wait, but x9 - 1 is a difference of ninth powers.
wait, actually, x9 - 1 can be factored as (x - 1)(x8 + x7 + x6 + ... + x + 1).
wait, is that correct?
let me think.
yes, for a^n - b^n = (a - b)(a^{n-1} + a^{n-2}b + ... + ab^{n-2} + b^{n-1}).
so if we have x9 - 1, that's (x)^9 - (1)^9, so it factors as (x - 1)(x8 + x7 + x6 + x5 + x4 + x3 + x2 + x + 1).
therefore, q(x) would be x8 + x7 + x6 + x5 + x4 + x3 + x2 + x + 1, right?
but then in our previous equation:
x9 + 1 = (x - 1)(q(x)) + 2
so if q(x) is x8 + x7 + x6 + x5 + x4 + x3 + x2 + x + 1, then (x - 1) times q(x) is x9 - 1.
therefore:
(x - 1)(q(x)) = x9 - 1
therefore, x9 +1 = (x9 -1) + 2, which is correct.
hence, x9 + 1 = (x -1)(q(x)) + 2, so the quotient is q(x) and the remainder is 2.
therefore, when we divide x9 +1 by x -1, the quotient is x8 +x7 +x6 +x5 +x4 +x3 +x2 +x +1, and the remainder is 2.
but the problem asks only for the quotient, so the answer should be that sum of powers of x from 8 down to 0.
wait, but hold on.
let me verify with the synthetic division again.
if we perform synthetic division of x9 +1 by x -1, then as i started earlier, the coefficients would be all 1s because each step you multiply the previous coefficient (which is 1) by 1 (the root) and add to the next coefficient (which is 0).
so:
coefficients:
1 | 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
bring down 1:
1
multiply by 1:
1
add to next coefficient (0):
1
multiply by 1:
1
add to next coefficient (0):
1
...
continue until the last coefficient.
so each coefficient in the quotient is 1, and the remainder is 1 + 1 = 2.
therefore, the quotient is x8 + x7 + x6 + x5 + x4 + x3 + x2 + x + 1 and remainder 2.
therefore, that's consistent with the factorization of x9 -1.
therefore, the quotient is the sum of powers from x8 down to x0 with coefficients 1.
therefore, the answer is x8 + x7 + x6 + x5 + x4 + x3 + x2 + x + 1.
wait, but just to make sure, let's check the degrees.
the dividend is degree 9, divisor is degree 1, so the quotient should be degree 8, which this is, and the remainder is a constant, which is correct.
so that seems right.
alternatively, another approach: polynomial long division.
let me try dividing x9 +1 by x -1 using long division to confirm.
set up the division:
____________
x -1 | x9 +0x8 +0x7 +0x6 +0x5 +0x4 +0x3 +0x2 +0x +1
first, divide x9 by x, get x8.
multiply the divisor (x -1) by x8: x9 - x8
subtract from the dividend:
(x9 +0x8 + ... ) - (x9 - x8) = 0x9 + x8 + ... = x8 + ...
bring down the next term, which is 0x7.
so now we have x8 - x7?
wait, no, actually, wait, let me do that step again.
after subtracting x9 - x8, we have:
0x9 + x8 + 0x7 +0x6...
so the next term is x8.
divide x8 by x, get x7.
multiply divisor by x7: x8 - x7
subtract from the current polynomial:
(x8 +0x7 +...) - (x8 - x7) = 0x8 + x7 + ...
bring down the next term, which is 0x6.
so now we have x7 - x6?
wait, actually:
after subtraction, we have x7 +0x6 +..., so bringing down the next term is 0x6.
so repeating this step each time, dividing the leading term by x gives the next term in the quotient, which is x7, then x6, etc., each time subtracting (term * (x -1)) from the remaining polynomial.
each step, the coefficient seems to be 1.
let's see:
first term: x8
second: x7
third: x6
continuing this way, each time the next term will be x^n where n decreases by 1 each time, and the coefficient is 1, because when you subtract (x^{k+1} - x^k), you get x^k, which then divided by x gives x^{k-1}, so the coefficient remains 1.
so after 8 steps, we would have terms x8 +x7 +x6 +x5 +x4 +x3 +x2 +x +1, and the remainder when dividing?
let me check.
after the last subtraction, what's left?
the original polynomial was x9 +0x8 +... +0x +1
after performing the division, each step removes up to the next lower degree term, but all the terms we had in between were zero except the constant term 1.
so when we get to the constant term, we have:
quotient so far: x8 +x7 +x6 +x5 +x4 +x3 +x2 +x +1
multiply this by (x -1):
(x9 -x8) + (x8 -x7) + (x7 -x6) + ... + (x -1)
notice that this telescopes:
x9 - x8 + x8 - x7 + x7 - x6 + ... + x -1
all the intermediate terms cancel, leaving x9 -1
therefore, (x8 +x7 +x6 +x5 +x4 +x3 +x2 +x +1)(x -1) = x9 -1
but our original dividend is x9 +1, so if we have x9 +1, then:
x9 +1 = (x9 -1) + 2
therefore, when divided by (x -1), the quotient is the polynomial above, x8 +x7 +x6 +x5 +x4 +x3 +x2 +x +1, and the remainder is 2.
hence, the division gives quotient = x8 +x7 +x6 +x5 +x4 +x3 +x2 +x +1, remainder = 2.
therefore, the answer should be that quotient.
so i think that's correct.
so the quotient is x8 + x7 + x6 + x5 + x4 + x3 + x2 + x + 1.
wait, but just to make sure, let's check the sum of that geometric series.
the quotient is the sum from k=0 to 8 of x^k.
so if we have the sum of x^8 + x^7 + ... + x +1, that is indeed the sum of a geometric series with ratio x, 9 terms.
the formula for the sum is (x^9 - 1)/(x - 1).
wait, but actually, the sum from k=0 to n-1 of x^k is (x^n - 1)/(x - 1).
here, n would be 9, so sum from k=0 to 8 of x^k is (x^9 - 1)/(x -1).
but in our case, when we divide x^9 +1 by x -1, the quotient is that sum plus a remainder of 2.
wait, but wait, (x^9 - 1)/(x -1) is exactly that sum.
so x^9 -1 = (x -1)*(sum from k=0 to 8 x^k).
so then, since our polynomial is x^9 +1, that's equal to (x^9 -1) + 2.
hence, dividing by (x -1), we get (x^9 -1)/(x -1) + 2/(x -1).
so the quotient is (x^9 -1)/(x -1) which is the sum, and the remainder is 2 as the remainder term.
therefore, quotient is sum from k=0 to8 x^k, which is x^8 +x^7 +...+x+1.
perfect, that confirms it.
therefore, i'm confident that the quotient is x8 +x7 +x6 +x5 +x4 +x3 +x2 +x +1.
so the problem is solved.
wait, just to make extra sure, let's check with a small example.
suppose we have x2 +1 divided by x -1.
the quotient should be x +1 with remainder 2, because (x -1)(x +1) = x2 -1, and x2 +1 = (x2 -1) +2.
so quotient is x +1, remainder 2.
similarly, in our case, when we divide x9 +1 by x -1, the quotient is the sum of x^k from 0 to8, and remainder 2.
the pattern is similar.
therefore, this makes sense.
therefore, the answer should be x8 +x7 +x6 +x5 +x4 +x3 +x2 +x +1.
but let me check once more.
if i take the quotient, x8 +x7 +x6 +x5 +x4 +x3 +x2 +x +1, multiply by (x -1), what do i get?
(x8 +x7 +x6 +x5 +x4 +x3 +x2 +x +1)(x -1) =
x9 +x8 +x7 +x6 +x5 +x4 +x3 +x2 +x
-
x8 +x7 +x6 +x5 +x4 +x3 +x2 +x +1
= x9 - 1
which is correct, so that difference gives x9 -1.
then since our original polynomial is x9 +1, which is (x9 -1) +2, so when divided by (x -1), the quotient is the sum (x8 + ... +1) and the remainder is 2.
therefore, that's all correct.
so the problem is asking for the quotient, which is the sum of powers from x8 down to x0, each with coefficient 1.
hence, the final answer is x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1.
**final answer**
\boxed{x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1}
</think>

answer: to find the quotient when \( x^9 + 1 \) is divided by \( x - 1 \), we can use the fact that \( x^n - 1 \) can be factored as \( (x - 1)(x^{n-1} + x^{n-2} + \cdots + x + 1) \). 

given the polynomial \( x^9 + 1 \), we can express it as:
\[
x^9 + 1 = (x^9 - 1) + 2
\]
we know that \( x^9 - 1 \) factors as:
\[
x^9 - 1 = (x - 1)(x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1)
\]
thus, substituting back, we get:
\[
x^9 + 1 = (x - 1)(x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1) + 2
\]
this shows that the quotient when \( x^9 + 1 \) is divided by \( x - 1 \) is \( x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 \) and the remainder is 2. 

therefore, the quotient is:
\[
\boxed{x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1}
\]
