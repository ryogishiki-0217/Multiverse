1: The direction vector is derived from the slope. Given the direction vector (-7 for the x-component. The y-component is calculated as b = slope * (-7), which equals (-1/4) * (-7) = 7/4. The direction vector is therefore (-7, 7/4).
</Path>
<Path>
2: The direction vector (-7, b) is verified by calculating b using the slope. Given the slope m = -1/4, the relationship b / -7 = -1/4 is established, leading to the equation b = (-7) * (-1/4). The product of -7 and -1/4 is 7/4. Thus, b is determined to be 7/4.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The direction vector was derived from the slope, and its components were verified using the calculated slope, resulting in a value of 7/4 for b.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Wait, so if direction vector is of the form (-7, b), then the slope should be b/(-7) = -1/4.
So solving for b: b / (-7) = -1/4 => b = (-7) * (-1/4) = 7/4.
Therefore, b is 7/4.
Let me check again.
The line passes through (-5,4) and (-1,3).
The direction vector can be found as (-1 - (-5), 3 - 4) = (4, -1).
So the direction vector is (4, -1).
Let's think in parallel.

1: The slope of the direction vector (4, -1) is calculated as -1/4.

2: The line's slope, calculated as (3 - 4) / (-1 - (-5)), simplifies to (-1) / 4, yielding -1/4.

<Conclusion>
The slope of the direction vector (4, -1) was found to be -1/4, and the slope of the line itself was confirmed as -1/4.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So slope is -1/4.
Now, if another direction vector is given as (-7, b), then the slope should also be equal to b / (-7).
Therefore, setting up the equation:
b / (-7) = -1/4
Multiply both sides by -7:
b = (-1/4) * (-7) = 7/4 = 1.75
So, yes, b is 7/4.

2: The direction vector (4, -1) is considered. Multiplying this vector by 7/4 results in (4*(7/4), -1*(7/4)), which simplifies to (7, -7/4). This product vector is not (-7, b). Multiplying the vector (4, -1) by -7/4 yields (4*(-7/4), -1*(-7/4)), simplifying to (-7, 7/4). This product matches the direction vector form (-7, b). The resulting vector is (-7, 7/4). This confirms the value of b as 7/4.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The direction vector (-7, 7/4) was confirmed by its slope of -1/4, and by its derivation from the direction vector (4, -1) scaled by -7/4.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Therefore, the answer should be 7/4.
I think that's correct.
Let me just think again.
The direction vector can be scaled by any scalar and it would still be a direction vector of the line.
So if original direction vector is (4, -1), then scaling by (-7)/4 would give (-7, 7/4).
Because 4 * (-7)/4 = -7, and -1 * (-7)/4 = 7/4.
So yes, that's how you get the direction vector (-7, 7/4).
Therefore, b is 7/4.
the final answer is 7/4
</Think>

Answer: The problem requires finding the value of \( b \) such that the direction vector of the given line is \( \begin{pmatrix} -7 \\ b \end{pmatrix} \).

First, we determine the slope of the line. The line passes through the points \((-5, 4)\) and \((-1, 3)\). The slope \( m \) is calculated as:
\[
m = \frac{3 - 4}{-1 - (-5)} = \frac{-1}{4} = -\frac{1}{4}
\]

Next, we know that the direction vector of a line is proportional to \( \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ m \end{pmatrix} \). Given the direction vector \( \begin{pmatrix} -7 \\ b \end{pmatrix} \), the slope can also be expressed as \( \frac{b}{-7} \). Setting this equal to the calculated slope:
\[
\frac{b}{-7} = -\frac{1}{4}
\]

Solving for \( b \):
\[
b = (-7) \times \left( -\frac{1}{4} \right) = \frac{7}{4}
\]

Thus, the value of \( b \) is \(\boxed{\frac{7}{4}}\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{\frac{7}{4}}\).

answer: the problem requires finding the value of \( b \) such that the direction vector of the given line is \( \begin{pmatrix} -7 \\ b \end{pmatrix} \).

first, we determine the slope of the line. the line passes through the points \((-5, 4)\) and \((-1, 3)\). the slope \( m \) is calculated as:
\[
m = \frac{3 - 4}{-1 - (-5)} = \frac{-1}{4} = -\frac{1}{4}
\]

next, we know that the direction vector of a line is proportional to \( \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ m \end{pmatrix} \). given the direction vector \( \begin{pmatrix} -7 \\ b \end{pmatrix} \), the slope can also be expressed as \( \frac{b}{-7} \). setting this equal to the calculated slope:
\[
\frac{b}{-7} = -\frac{1}{4}
\]

solving for \( b \):
\[
b = (-7) \times \left( -\frac{1}{4} \right) = \frac{7}{4}
\]

thus, the value of \( b \) is \(\boxed{\frac{7}{4}}\).

the final answer is \(\boxed{\frac{7}{4}}\)
