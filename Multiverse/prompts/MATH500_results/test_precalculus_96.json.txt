Okay, so I need to find the value of b such that the direction vector of the line is (-7, b).
Let me look at the graph provided.
Hmm, the line is shown in red, and it passes through two points that are marked.
Let me try to identify the coordinates of those points.
Let's think in parallel.

Wait, actually, let me double-check.
The points where the line intersects the axes might not be integers.
Let me look closer.
The left intersection (with the y-axis) seems to be at x=-5, y=4?
Wait, the point A is at (-5, 4) and point B is at (-1, 3).
Let me check if the line connects these points.
From (-5,4) to (-1,3).

Wait, so direction vector from A to B is (4, -1).

Hmm.
If the direction vector is a multiple of (4, -1), because direction vectors can be scalar multiples.
So maybe (-7, b) is a multiple of (4, -1).

Answer: To find the value of \( b \) such that the direction vector of the line is \( \begin{pmatrix} -7 \\ b \end{pmatrix} \), we start by identifying two points on the line from the graph. These points are \( A = (-5, 4) \) and \( B = (-1, 3) \). 

Next, we determine the direction vector from point \( A \) to point \( B \). The direction vector is calculated as:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -1 - (-5) \\ 3 - 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

We need the direction vector \( \begin{pmatrix} -7 \\ b \end{pmatrix} \) to be a scalar multiple of \( \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \). Let \( k \) be the scalar such that:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\ b \end{pmatrix} = k \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Equating the components, we get:
\[
-7 = 4k \quad \text{and} \quad b = -k
\]

Solving for \( k \) from the first equation:
\[
k = -\frac{7}{4}
\]

Substituting \( k \) into the second equation to find \( b \):
\[
b = -\left(-\frac{7}{4}\right) = \frac{7}{4}
\]

Thus, the value of \( b \) is:
\[
\boxed{\dfrac{7}{4}}
\]

answer: to find the value of \( b \) such that the direction vector of the line is \( \begin{pmatrix} -7 \\ b \end{pmatrix} \), we start by identifying two points on the line from the graph. these points are \( a = (-5, 4) \) and \( b = (-1, 3) \). 

next, we determine the direction vector from point \( a \) to point \( b \). the direction vector is calculated as:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -1 - (-5) \\ 3 - 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

we need the direction vector \( \begin{pmatrix} -7 \\ b \end{pmatrix} \) to be a scalar multiple of \( \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \). let \( k \) be the scalar such that:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\ b \end{pmatrix} = k \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

equating the components, we get:
\[
-7 = 4k \quad \text{and} \quad b = -k
\]

solving for \( k \) from the first equation:
\[
k = -\frac{7}{4}
\]

substituting \( k \) into the second equation to find \( b \):
\[
b = -\left(-\frac{7}{4}\right) = \frac{7}{4}
\]

thus, the value of \( b \) is:
\[
\boxed{\dfrac{7}{4}}
\]
