Okay, so the problem is asking, "What power of 4 is equal to 8?" and they want the answer as a common fraction.
Hmm, let me think.
I need to find an exponent, right, such that 4 raised to that exponent equals 8.
Let me write that as an equation: 4^x = 8.
Now, how do I solve for x here?
I remember that when dealing with exponential equations, it's often helpful to express both sides with the same base.
Let me see if 4 and 8 can both be written as powers of 2.
Well, 4 is 2 squared (2^2) and 8 is 2 cubed (2^3).
So maybe I can rewrite the equation using base 2.
Let's try that.
If I rewrite 4 as 2^2, then (2^2)^x = 2^3.
Because 4^x is (2^2)^x, which is 2^(2x), and that equals 2^3.
If I have the same base, then the exponents must be equal.
So, 2x = 3.
Then solving for x, I divide both sides by 2: x = 3/2.
Let me verify that.
4^(3/2).
Let's see, 4 to the 3/2 power.
Since 4 is 2^2, this would be (2^2)^(3/2) = 2^(2*(3/2)) = 2^3 = 8.
Yes, that works.
So that's correct.
Therefore, the answer should be 3/2.
But let me check again.
The problem asks for "what power of 4 is equal to 8?"
So 4^(3/2) = 8, yes.
So as a common fraction, it's 3/2.
I don't think there's any other way to express this.
Alternatively, is there another way to solve this?
Maybe using logarithms?
Let's see.
Taking log of both sides: log(4^x) = log(8).
Then x * log(4) = log(8).
Therefore, x = log(8) / log(4).
Let's compute that.
log(8) is log(2^3) = 3 log(2), and log(4) is log(2^2) = 2 log(2).
So x = (3 log(2)) / (2 log(2)) ) = 3/2.
Same result.
So whether you use bases change or exponent properties, you end up with 3/2.
So that's correct.
Just to make sure there are no mistakes, let's think about this.
4 to the power of 1 is 4, 4 to the power of 2 is 16, so between 1 and 2, yeah, 8 is between 4 and 16, so 4 to the 3/2.
Since 4^(1/2) is 2, and 4^(3/2) is 4^(1 + 1/2) = 4^1 * 4^(1/2) = 4 * 2 = 8.
Perfect.
So that's another way to think about it.
So definitely, the answer is 3/2.
Just to confirm, no other fraction would satisfy 4^x=8.
So I think that's good.
**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{3}{2}}

Answer: To solve the problem of finding what power of 4 is equal to 8, we start by setting up the equation \(4^x = 8\). 

Next, we express both 4 and 8 as powers of 2:
- \(4\) can be written as \(2^2\)
- \(8\) can be written as \(2^3\)

Rewriting the equation \(4^x = 8\) using these expressions, we get:
\[
(2^2)^x = 2^3
\]

Simplifying the left side, we have:
\[
2^{2x} = 2^3
\]

Since the bases are the same, we can set the exponents equal to each other:
\[
2x = 3
\]

Solving for \(x\), we divide both sides by 2:
\[
x = \frac{3}{2}
\]

To verify, we check if \(4^{3/2} = 8\):
- \(4^{1/2} = 2\)
- \(4^{3/2} = 4^1 \cdot 4^{1/2} = 4 \cdot 2 = 8\)

The verification confirms our solution. Therefore, the power of 4 that equals 8 is \(\frac{3}{2}\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{\dfrac{3}{2}}\).
