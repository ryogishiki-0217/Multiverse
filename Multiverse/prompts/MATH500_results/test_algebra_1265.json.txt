Okay, so the problem is asking, "What power of 4 is equal to 8?" and they want the answer as a common fraction.
Hmm, let's think about this.
First, I need to translate this into a mathematical equation.
So, they're asking for an exponent x such that 4 raised to the power of x equals 8.
So, the equation is 4^x = 8.
Now, how do I solve for x here?
Well, since the bases are different but the exponents might be related, maybe I can express both 4 and 8 as powers of 2.
That could simplify things.
Let's try that.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: The expression of 4 as a power of 2.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: The expression of 8 as a power of 2.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The number 4 is expressed as 2^2.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The number 8 can be expressed as 2^3.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The numerical values 4 and 8 are equivalently represented as 2^2 and 2^3, respectively.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So substituting back into the equation: (2^2)^x = 2^3.
Then, when you raise a power to another power, you multiply the exponents.
So 2^(2x) = 2^3.
Then, since the bases are the same, I can set the exponents equal to each other.
So 2x = 3.
Solving for x, divide both sides by 2: x = 3/2.
Hmm, so that would mean 4^(3/2) is 8.
Let me check that.
4 to the 3/2 power.
Remember that exponent laws say that a^(m/n) is equivalent to the nth root of a to the m power.
So 4^(3/2) is the same as the square root of 4 to the 3rd.
Since the square root of 4 is 2, and 2^3 is 8.
Yep, that works.
So x = 3/2.
But the problem asks for the answer as a common fraction, which 3/2 already is.
So that's straightforward.
Alternatively, is there another way to confirm this?
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: Verification of the solution x = 3/2 by direct substitution into the original equation 4^x = 8.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: Verification of the solution x = 3/2 by rewriting the equation 4^x = 8 in logarithmic form and evaluating the logarithm.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The solution x = 3/2 is verified by direct substitution into the original equation 4^x = 8, yielding 4^(3/2). The expression 4^(3/2) simplifies to (4^(1/2))^3, which is 2^3, equaling 8. This confirms the solution is correct.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The equation 4^x = 8 is rewritten in logarithmic form as log base 4 of 8 = x. This logarithm is evaluated as x = log 8 / log 4, using the change of base formula. Calculating the logarithm values, log 8 (base 10) is approximately 0.9031 and log 4 (base 10) is approximately 0.6021. The division 0.9031 / 0.6021 is approximately 1.5. The fraction 3/2 is equivalent to 1.5, confirming the result. This method also confirms the solution.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The solution x = 3/2 is confirmed by direct substitution into the original equation, where 4^(3/2) evaluates to 8, and by rewriting the equation in logarithmic form and evaluating log base 4 of 8, which simplifies to 3/2.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Alternatively, if I think about powers of 4 and 8.
Let's list some powers of 4:
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: The value of 4^0.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: The value of 4^1.
</Outline>
<Outline>
3: The value of 4^2.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The value of 4^0 is 1.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The value of 4^1 is 4.
</Path>
<Path>
3: The square of 4, 4^2, equals 16.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The powers 4^0, 4^1, and 4^2 yield the values 1, 4, and 16, respectively.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Hmm, 4^0=1, 4^1=4, 4^2=16.
8 is between 4 and 16, so the exponent should be between 1 and 2.
Wait, but 8 is not a power of 4.
Hence, the exponent must be a fraction.
But we already found 3/2.
Let's see, 4^(1/2) is 2, which is correct.
Then 4^(3/2) is 4^(1 + 1/2) = 4^1 * 4^(1/2) = 4 * 2 = 8.
Yep, same as before.
Alternatively, maybe using exponents with the same base.
Since 4 and 8 can both be written as powers of 2.
So 4 is 2^2, 8 is 2^3.
So (2^2)^x = 2^3.
Which again leads to 2x = 3, so x = 3/2.
So all these methods confirm the same answer.
So the answer is 3/2.
Hmm.
Wait, the problem is asking "What power of 4 is equal to 8?" and my answer is 3/2.
Expressed as a common fraction, that's three-halves.
Is that it?
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: Confirmation of the final answer format.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: Confirmation of the problem statement interpretation.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The answer "three-halves" is a common fraction, and the problem requires the answer to be expressed as a common fraction.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The problem asks for "the power of 4 equal to 8," which means solving 4^x = 8. This requires finding the exponent x, which has been determined to be 3/2.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The answer 3/2 is a common fraction, fulfilling the problem's requirement. The interpretation of the problem as requiring the solution to 4^x = 8 is correct.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So, yeah, seems straightforward.
Let me just check if there's another possible answer or another way to interpret the question.
Alternatively, maybe if someone thought that 4 to the power of something equals 8, but perhaps by division?
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>

<Outline>
1: The result of 4 to the power of 1/3.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: The result of 4 to the power of 2/3.

</Goal>
<Path>
1: The expression 4^(1/3) is equivalent to the cube root of 4.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The value of 4^(2/3) is (4^(1/3))^2.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The values of 4^(1/3) and 4^(2/3) are the cube root of 4 and (4^(1/3))^2, respectively.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
But none of these would be 8.
So no, the only exponent is 3/2.
Another check: 4^(3/2) as (4^3)^(1/2).
4^3 is 64, square root of 64 is 8.
Yep, that works.
So, all checks out.
Therefore, the answer is 3/2.
the final answer is 3/2
</Think>

Answer: To solve the problem of finding what power of 4 is equal to 8, we start by setting up the equation \(4^x = 8\). 

Next, we express 4 and 8 as powers of 2:
- \(4 = 2^2\)
- \(8 = 2^3\)

Substituting these into the equation, we get:
\[
(2^2)^x = 2^3
\]

Using the property of exponents \((a^m)^n = a^{mn}\), we simplify the left side:
\[
2^{2x} = 2^3
\]

Since the bases are the same, we can set the exponents equal to each other:
\[
2x = 3
\]

Solving for \(x\), we divide both sides by 2:
\[
x = \frac{3}{2}
\]

We verify this solution by calculating \(4^{3/2}\):
- \(4^{1/2} = 2\)
- \(4^{3/2} = 4^1 \cdot 4^{1/2} = 4 \cdot 2 = 8\)

This confirms our solution. Therefore, the power of 4 that equals 8 is \(\frac{3}{2}\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{\frac{3}{2}}\).
