<Think>
Okay, so I need to solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\).
Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.
First, I remember that when dealing with rational inequalities, especially those involving absolute values, it's important to consider the critical points where the expression can change signs.
Also, the denominator can't be zero, so I need to note those values as points where the expression is undefined.
Let me break it down step by step.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: The condition under which a rational expression is negative.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: The impact of the absolute value in the numerator on its sign.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: A rational expression is negative if its numerator and denominator have opposite signs.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The numerator is an absolute value expression, \(|x^2 - 81|\), which by definition is always non-negative. Consequently, the numerator will be zero when the expression inside the absolute value is zero, and positive otherwise.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The inequality requires the numerator and denominator to have opposite signs. The numerator, being an absolute value, is non-negative, meaning it is zero at specific points and positive elsewhere.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So the numerator is zero when \(x^2 - 81 = 0\), which factors into \((x - 9)(x + 9) = 0\).
So x = 9 and x = -9 are the points where the numerator is zero.
But since it's an absolute value, those points are just going to be tangent to the x-axis, right?
Wait, but absolute value functions are always non-negative, so the numerator here is always ≥ 0, and equals zero at x = 9 and x = -9.
So, the numerator is non-negative everywhere else.
Now, the denominator is \(x^2 - 36x\).
Let me factor that: \(x(x - 36)\).
Wait, wait, actually \(x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36)\).
So the denominator is zero at x = 0 and x = 36.
Therefore, these two points, x = 0 and x = 36, are excluded from the domain because they make the denominator zero.
So the expression is undefined at x = 0 and x = 36.
Additionally, the original inequality is strictly less than 0, so we need the entire expression to be negative.
Since the numerator is an absolute value, which is always non-negative, the only way the fraction can be negative is if the denominator is negative.
Because a non-negative number divided by a negative number is negative.
But the numerator is zero at x = 9 and x = -9, so at those points, the entire expression would be 0/(denominator), which is zero.
But the inequality is strictly less than 0, so those points cannot be included in the solution set.
Therefore, the expression will be negative when the denominator is negative, excluding the points where the numerator is zero (x = 9 and x = -9) and where the denominator is zero (x = 0 and x = 36).
Therefore, first, identify where the denominator is negative.
The denominator is \(x(x - 36)\).
Let me determine where this product is negative.
The critical points are at x = 0 and x = 36.
These divide the real number line into three intervals: (-∞, 0), (0, 36), and (36, ∞).
Let me test each interval:
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: Determination of the sign of the denominator \(x(x-36)\) on the interval \((-∞, 0)\).
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: Determination of the sign of the denominator \(x(x-36)\) on the interval \((0, 36)\).
</Outline>
<Outline>
3: Determination of the sign of the denominator \(x(x-36)\) on the interval \((36, ∞)\).
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: For the interval \((-∞, 0)\), a test point \(x = -1\) is selected. Evaluating the denominator at this point yields \((-1)(-1-36) = (-1)(-37) = 37\), which is positive. Therefore, the denominator is positive on \((-∞, 0)\).
</Path>
<Path>
2: The sign of the denominator \(x(x - 36)\) on the interval \((0, 36)\) is determined by testing a value within this interval, such as x=18. For x=18, the product \(18(18 - 36)\) equals \(18 \times (-18) = -324\), which is negative.
</Path>
<Path>
3: For the interval (36, ∞), both factors x and (x - 36) are positive, leading to a positive product.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The sign of the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is positive on the interval \((-∞, 0)\), negative on the interval \((0, 36)\), and positive on the interval \((36, ∞)\).
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Therefore, the denominator is negative on (0, 36).
So the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) is negative when x is in (0, 36), but we have to exclude the points where the numerator is zero, which are x = 9 and x = -9.
However, x = -9 is not in the interval (0, 36).
So in the interval (0, 36), the only point where the numerator is zero is x = 9.
Therefore, we need to exclude x = 9 from the solution.
Wait, but x = 9 is in the interval (0, 36).
So the solution would be the interval (0, 36) without the point x = 9.
But wait, let me confirm again.
The numerator is zero at x = 9 and x = -9.
At these points, the expression equals zero, which is not less than 0, so they are excluded.
However, x = -9 is not in the interval where the denominator is negative (0, 36).
So only x = 9 is inside the interval (0, 36) where the denominator is negative, causing the expression to be zero there.
Therefore, the solution set should be (0, 9) union (9, 36).
Wait, but let me double-check.
Wait, if the denominator is negative on (0, 36), and the numerator is positive except at x = 9 and x = -9.
Since in the interval (0, 36), the numerator is positive except at x = 9 where it is zero.
So in (0, 9), the numerator is positive, denominator negative: so the fraction is negative.
At x = 9, the numerator is zero: fraction is zero.
In (9, 36), numerator is positive, denominator still negative: fraction is negative.
Therefore, the fraction is negative on (0, 9) and (9, 36).
But x = 9 makes it zero, so we exclude that point.
So the solution is (0, 9) U (9, 36).
But let me check the endpoints.
The original inequality is strict (< 0), so the endpoints are not included.
The denominator is zero at x = 0 and x = 36, so those are not included.
Numerator is zero at x = 9, which is included in the interval but must be excluded because the inequality is strict.
So yes, (0, 9) U (9, 36).
Wait, but let me think again.
Wait, when x is in (0, 36), denominator is negative.
Numerator is |x2 -81|.
Let's analyze the numerator.
The numerator is |x2 -81|, which is the absolute value of a number.
So, it's always non-negative, and it's zero at x = 9 and x = -9.
So in the interval (0, 36), the numerator is |x2 -81|.
Let's see, between x = 0 and x = 9, x2 is between 0 and 81, so x2 -81 is between -81 and 0.
Taking absolute value, it becomes 81 - x2, so positive.
Similarly, between x = 9 and x = 36, x2 is between 81 and 1296, so x2 -81 is positive, so absolute value is x2 -81.
So in the entire interval (0, 36), except x =9, the numerator is positive.
At x=9, numerator is zero.
Therefore, the expression is negative on (0, 9) U (9, 36), since numerator is positive and denominator is negative, making the fraction negative.
At x=9, the expression is zero, which does not satisfy the inequality.
Therefore, the solution set is (0, 9) U (9, 36).
But hold on, I need to make sure that there aren't any other intervals.
Wait, the numerator is non-negative everywhere, denominator is negative only on (0, 36).
Therefore, the only place where the expression is negative is when x is in (0, 36) excluding x=9.
Therefore, yes, (0,9) U (9,36).
Let me check with test values.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: The value of the expression at x=1.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: The value of the expression at x=9.
</Outline>
<Outline>
3: The value of the expression at x=10.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: A test value of x=1 is chosen, which is within the interval (0,9). The numerator, |1^2 - 81|, evaluates to |1 - 81|, which is |-80|, resulting in 80. The denominator, 1^2 - 36*1, calculates to 1 - 36, yielding -35. The expression's value is 80 / -35, which is approximately -2.285, a negative number.
</Path>
<Path>
2: At x=9, the numerator is |9^2 - 81| = |81 - 81| = 0, resulting in a value of 0.
</Path>
<Path>
3: At x=10, the numerator |10^2 - 81| evaluates to |100 - 81|, which is 19. The denominator 10^2 - 36*10 becomes 100 - 360, resulting in -260. The expression value is 19/-260, approximately -0.073, which is less than 0.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The expression evaluates to approximately -2.285 at x=1, 0 at x=9, and approximately -0.073 at x=10.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Similarly, at x = 35, numerator is |1225 -81| = 1144, denominator is 35^2 -36*35 = 35*(35 -36) = 35*(-1) = -35, so 1144 / (-35) ≈ -32.685, which is negative.
So, in the interval (0, 36), except x=9, the expression is negative.
At x=9, it's zero.
Therefore, solution is (0, 9) U (9, 36).
But let's check x values outside (0, 36).
For example, x = -1.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: The sign of the expression evaluated at x=-1.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: The sign of the expression evaluated at x=40.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) is evaluated at x=-1. The numerator, |(-1)^2 - 81|, simplifies to |1 - 81|, which is |-80|, resulting in 80. The denominator, (-1)^2 - 36*(-1), calculates to 1 + 36, yielding 37. The expression value is 80/37, approximately 2.162, a positive number, meaning it does not satisfy the inequality.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) is evaluated at x=40, resulting in \(\frac{|40^2 - 81|}{40^2 - 36*40}\), which simplifies to \(\frac{|1600 - 81|}{1600 - 1440}\) or \(\frac{1519}{160}\), a positive value. This confirms the expression is positive for x > 36.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The expression evaluates to a positive value at x=-1, indicating the inequality is not satisfied for x < 0. The expression also evaluates to a positive value at x=40, confirming the inequality is not satisfied for x > 36.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Therefore, outside of (0, 36), the expression is positive, so those intervals are not part of the solution.
Therefore, the solution set is (0, 9) U (9, 36).
But wait, the question is written as x2 -36x, which is x(x -36).
So, when x is between 0 and 36, that expression is negative.
So, yes, the fraction is negative there except where numerator is zero.
But just to make sure, let me check another point near x=9.
Let's take x=8.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: The value of the expression at x=8.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: The value of the expression at x=10.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: At x=8, the numerator is |8^2 - 81|, which evaluates to |64 - 81|, resulting in |-17|, or 17. The denominator is 8^2 - 36*8, calculated as 64 - 288, yielding -224. The expression value is 17/-224, approximately -0.0759, which is less than 0.
</Path>
<Path>
2: At x=10, the numerator |x^2 - 81| evaluates to |100 - 81|, which is 19. The denominator x^2 - 36x evaluates to 100 - 360, which is -260. The expression value is 19 / (-260), approximately -0.073, confirming it is negative.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The expression evaluates to approximately -0.0759 at x=8 and approximately -0.073 at x=10, both of which are negative values.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So, in both cases, negative.
So the expression is indeed negative on (0, 9) and (9, 36).
Therefore, the solution set is the union of these two intervals, not including 9, and not including 0 and 36, which are the points where the denominator is zero.
So, in interval notation, that would be (0, 9) U (9, 36).
Therefore, I think that's the answer.
But let me check once more if there's any mistake.
Wait, another way to approach absolute value inequalities.
Maybe I missed something?
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: The definition of the absolute value function \(|x^2 - 81|\).
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: The definition of the absolute value function \(|x^2 - 81|\) on the interval \(x \in (0, 9)\).
</Outline>
<Outline>
3: The definition of the absolute value function \(|x^2 - 81|\) on the interval \(x \in (9, 36)\).
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The absolute value function \(|x^2 - 81|\) can be expressed as a piecewise function: it equals \(x^2 - 81\) when \(x^2 - 81 \geq 0\), and equals \(81 - x^2\) otherwise.
</Path>
<Path>
2: For the interval \(x \in (0, 9)\), the expression \(x^2 - 81\) is negative, so the absolute value \(|x^2 - 81|\) is equivalent to \(-(x^2 - 81)\), which simplifies to \(81 - x^2\).
</Path>
<Path>
3: For values of \(x\) in the interval \((9, 36)\), the expression \(x^2 - 81\) is positive, resulting in \(|x^2 - 81| = x^2 - 81\).
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The function \(|x^2 - 81|\) is equivalent to \(81 - x^2\) for \(x \in (0, 9)\) and \(x^2 - 81\) for \(x \in (9, 36)\).
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Therefore, we can split the inequality into two cases based on the definition of absolute value.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: The inequality for the case \(x^2 \geq 81\).
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: The inequality for the case \(x^2 < 81\).
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The first case is when \(x^2 \geq 81\), which implies \(|x^2 - 81| = x^2 - 81\). The inequality then becomes \(\frac{x^2 - 81}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\). The numerator, \(x^2 - 81\), factors into \((x - 9)(x + 9)\), and the denominator, \(x^2 - 36x\), factors into \(x(x - 36)\). The critical points for this case are x = -9, 0, 9, and 36, which divide the real number line into intervals where the expression's sign can be determined. The condition \(x^2 \geq 81\) restricts the domain for this case to \(x \leq -9\) or \(x \geq 9\).
</Path>
<Path>
2: For the case \(x^2 < 81\), the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\) is equivalent to \(\frac{81 - x^2}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\).
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The inequality splits into two cases based on the definition of the absolute value numerator: \(\frac{x^2 - 81}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\) for \(x^2 \geq 81\), and \(\frac{81 - x^2}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\) for \(x^2 < 81\).
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Case 1: x ≤ -9 or x ≥ 9
Then the inequality is \(\frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)} < 0\)
We need to solve this inequality under the condition that x ≤ -9 or x ≥ 9.
So first, let's note all the critical points where numerator or denominator is zero.
Numerator is zero at x = 9 and x = -9.
Denominator is zero at x = 0 and x = 36.
So these points divide the real line into intervals.
But considering our case 1 is x ≤ -9 or x ≥ 9, so we need to analyze the sign of the expression in those regions.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: The sign analysis of the expression \(\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}\) for the condition \(x \leq -9\).
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: The sign analysis of the expression \(\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}\) for the condition \(x \geq 9\).
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: For \(x \leq -9\), the numerator \((x - 9)(x + 9)\) is positive since \(x \leq -9\) implies \(x+9 \leq 0\) and \(x-9 \leq -18 < 0\); the product of two negative terms is positive. The denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is positive because \(x \leq -9\) (negative) and \(x - 36 \leq -45\) (negative); the product of two negative terms is positive. The overall expression \(\frac{+}{+}\) is positive, which does not satisfy the inequality \(< 0\). The interval \(x \leq -9\) is therefore not part of the solution.
</Path>
<Path>
2: For \(x \geq 9\), the numerator \((x-9)(x+9)\) is non-negative since \(x \geq 9\). The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative for \(9 \leq x < 36\) and positive for \(x > 36\). The expression \(\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}\) is therefore negative for \(9 \leq x < 36\) and positive for \(x > 36\). When \(x = 9\), the numerator is zero, making the expression equal to 0, which is not less than 0. For \(9 < x < 36\), the numerator \((x-9)(x+9)\) is positive, and the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative, resulting in a negative expression. For \(x > 36\), the numerator is positive and the denominator is positive, making the expression positive. The solution for this case is the interval \(9 < x < 36\).
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The expression \(\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}\) is positive for \(x \leq -9\) and negative for \(9 < x < 36\). The inequality \(< 0\) is not satisfied for \(x \leq -9\), but is satisfied for \(9 < x < 36\).
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Case 2: When x2 < 81, which is when -9 < x < 9.
Then the inequality becomes \(\frac{81 - x^2}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\).
Which is \(\frac{-(x^2 - 81)}{x(x - 36)} < 0\), which is \(\frac{-(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)} < 0\), which is equivalent to \(\frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)} > 0\) after multiplying both sides by -1 and reversing the inequality sign.
So in this case, we need the expression \(\frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}\) to be positive.
Now, in the interval -9 < x < 9, let's analyze the sign of each factor.
Let's think in parallel.

</Path>
<Path>
2: For \(x \in (-9, 9)\), the factor \(x + 9\) is positive, as \(x > -9\).
</Path>
<Path>
3: The factor \(x\), for \(x \in (-9, 9)\), is negative when \(x \in (-9, 0)\) and positive when \(x \in (0, 9)\).

<Path>
4: The factor \(x - 36\) is negative for all values of \(x\) in the interval \((-9, 9)\).
</Path>
<Conclusion>
For \(x \in (-9, 9)\), the factors \(x-9\) and \(x-36\) are negative, and the factor \(x+9\) is positive. The sign of the factor \(x\) is negative for \(x \in (-9, 0)\) and positive for \(x \in (0, 9)\).

The expression \(\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}\) is negative for \(x \in (-9, 0)\) and positive for \(x \in (0, 9)\).
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So, in the interval (0, 9), the expression is positive, which satisfies the case 2 inequality (expression > 0).
But we need to remember that case 2 is when x is in (-9, 9).
Therefore, combining these, in the interval (0, 9), the expression is positive, so it satisfies case 2.
However, in (-9, 0), the expression is negative, so it does not satisfy the case 2 inequality (which requires expression > 0).
Therefore, in case 2 (when x is between -9 and 9), the inequality holds when x is in (0, 9).
But wait, also note that in case 2, x is in (-9, 9), and the denominator is x(x -36).
At x =0, the denominator is zero, which is undefined.
So in the interval (0, 9), we have to exclude x=0, but x=0 is not in (0,9), so it's already excluded.
Similarly, x=36 is not in this interval.
Therefore, from case 2, the solution is (0, 9).
Wait, but when x is in (-9, 0), the expression is negative, but case 2 requires the expression to be positive.
So (-9, 0) is not part of the solution.
Therefore, case 2 contributes (0, 9) to the solution.
Case 1 contributed (9, 36).
Therefore, combining both cases, we have (0, 9) U (9, 36).
Which matches what I concluded earlier.
Therefore, this seems correct.
Therefore, the solution set is (0, 9) U (9, 36).
Therefore, I can conclude that.
But just to double-check, take a test point in (0, 9), like x=1: as before, it's negative, satisfies the inequality.
Take a point in (9, 36), like x=10: also negative.
Points outside these intervals: x=-1, positive; x=9: zero; x=36: undefined.
All checks out.
Therefore, the answer is (0, 9) U (9, 36).
In interval notation, that's how it's written.
So, yes.
**Final Answer**
The solution is \(\boxed{(0, 9) \cup (9, 36)}\).

Answer: To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the critical points and intervals where the expression is negative.

1. **Numerator Analysis**:
   - The numerator is \(|x^2 - 81|\), which is always non-negative and zero at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\).

2. **Denominator Analysis**:
   - The denominator \(x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36)\) is zero at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\), making the expression undefined at these points.
   - The denominator is negative when \(0 < x < 36\).

3. **Critical Points and Intervals**:
   - The critical points are \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), \(x = 9\), and \(x = 36\).
   - These points divide the real line into intervals: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

4. **Sign Analysis**:
   - The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is non-negative and zero at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\).
   - The denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is negative for \(0 < x < 36\).

5. **Case Analysis**:
   - For \(x\) in \((0, 36)\), the denominator is negative. The numerator is zero at \(x = 9\) and positive otherwise.
   - The expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) is negative when the denominator is negative and the numerator is positive, i.e., in \((0, 9)\) and \((9, 36)\).

6. **Exclusion of Critical Points**:
   - At \(x = 9\), the expression is zero, which does not satisfy the inequality.
   - At \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\), the expression is undefined.

Combining these results, the solution to the inequality is \((0, 9) \cup (9, 36)\).

\(\boxed{(0, 9) \cup (9, 36)}\)

<think>
okay, so i need to solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\).
hmm, let me think about how to approach this.
first, i remember that when dealing with rational inequalities, especially those involving absolute values, it's important to consider the critical points where the expression can change signs.
also, the denominator can't be zero, so i need to note those values as points where the expression is undefined.
let me break it down step by step.
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>
<goal>
<outline>
1: the condition under which a rational expression is negative.
</outline>
<outline>
2: the impact of the absolute value in the numerator on its sign.
</outline>
</goal>
<path>
1: a rational expression is negative if its numerator and denominator have opposite signs.
</path>
<path>
2: the numerator is an absolute value expression, \(|x^2 - 81|\), which by definition is always non-negative. consequently, the numerator will be zero when the expression inside the absolute value is zero, and positive otherwise.
</path>
<conclusion>
the inequality requires the numerator and denominator to have opposite signs. the numerator, being an absolute value, is non-negative, meaning it is zero at specific points and positive elsewhere.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
so the numerator is zero when \(x^2 - 81 = 0\), which factors into \((x - 9)(x + 9) = 0\).
so x = 9 and x = -9 are the points where the numerator is zero.
but since it's an absolute value, those points are just going to be tangent to the x-axis, right?
wait, but absolute value functions are always non-negative, so the numerator here is always ≥ 0, and equals zero at x = 9 and x = -9.
so, the numerator is non-negative everywhere else.
now, the denominator is \(x^2 - 36x\).
let me factor that: \(x(x - 36)\).
wait, wait, actually \(x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36)\).
so the denominator is zero at x = 0 and x = 36.
therefore, these two points, x = 0 and x = 36, are excluded from the domain because they make the denominator zero.
so the expression is undefined at x = 0 and x = 36.
additionally, the original inequality is strictly less than 0, so we need the entire expression to be negative.
since the numerator is an absolute value, which is always non-negative, the only way the fraction can be negative is if the denominator is negative.
because a non-negative number divided by a negative number is negative.
but the numerator is zero at x = 9 and x = -9, so at those points, the entire expression would be 0/(denominator), which is zero.
but the inequality is strictly less than 0, so those points cannot be included in the solution set.
therefore, the expression will be negative when the denominator is negative, excluding the points where the numerator is zero (x = 9 and x = -9) and where the denominator is zero (x = 0 and x = 36).
therefore, first, identify where the denominator is negative.
the denominator is \(x(x - 36)\).
let me determine where this product is negative.
the critical points are at x = 0 and x = 36.
these divide the real number line into three intervals: (-∞, 0), (0, 36), and (36, ∞).
let me test each interval:
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>
<goal>
<outline>
1: determination of the sign of the denominator \(x(x-36)\) on the interval \((-∞, 0)\).
</outline>
<outline>
2: determination of the sign of the denominator \(x(x-36)\) on the interval \((0, 36)\).
</outline>
<outline>
3: determination of the sign of the denominator \(x(x-36)\) on the interval \((36, ∞)\).
</outline>
</goal>
<path>
1: for the interval \((-∞, 0)\), a test point \(x = -1\) is selected. evaluating the denominator at this point yields \((-1)(-1-36) = (-1)(-37) = 37\), which is positive. therefore, the denominator is positive on \((-∞, 0)\).
</path>
<path>
2: the sign of the denominator \(x(x - 36)\) on the interval \((0, 36)\) is determined by testing a value within this interval, such as x=18. for x=18, the product \(18(18 - 36)\) equals \(18 \times (-18) = -324\), which is negative.
</path>
<path>
3: for the interval (36, ∞), both factors x and (x - 36) are positive, leading to a positive product.
</path>
<conclusion>
the sign of the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is positive on the interval \((-∞, 0)\), negative on the interval \((0, 36)\), and positive on the interval \((36, ∞)\).
</conclusion>
</parallel>
therefore, the denominator is negative on (0, 36).
so the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) is negative when x is in (0, 36), but we have to exclude the points where the numerator is zero, which are x = 9 and x = -9.
however, x = -9 is not in the interval (0, 36).
so in the interval (0, 36), the only point where the numerator is zero is x = 9.
therefore, we need to exclude x = 9 from the solution.
wait, but x = 9 is in the interval (0, 36).
so the solution would be the interval (0, 36) without the point x = 9.
but wait, let me confirm again.
the numerator is zero at x = 9 and x = -9.
at these points, the expression equals zero, which is not less than 0, so they are excluded.
however, x = -9 is not in the interval where the denominator is negative (0, 36).
so only x = 9 is inside the interval (0, 36) where the denominator is negative, causing the expression to be zero there.
therefore, the solution set should be (0, 9) union (9, 36).
wait, but let me double-check.
wait, if the denominator is negative on (0, 36), and the numerator is positive except at x = 9 and x = -9.
since in the interval (0, 36), the numerator is positive except at x = 9 where it is zero.
so in (0, 9), the numerator is positive, denominator negative: so the fraction is negative.
at x = 9, the numerator is zero: fraction is zero.
in (9, 36), numerator is positive, denominator still negative: fraction is negative.
therefore, the fraction is negative on (0, 9) and (9, 36).
but x = 9 makes it zero, so we exclude that point.
so the solution is (0, 9) u (9, 36).
but let me check the endpoints.
the original inequality is strict (< 0), so the endpoints are not included.
the denominator is zero at x = 0 and x = 36, so those are not included.
numerator is zero at x = 9, which is included in the interval but must be excluded because the inequality is strict.
so yes, (0, 9) u (9, 36).
wait, but let me think again.
wait, when x is in (0, 36), denominator is negative.
numerator is |x2 -81|.
let's analyze the numerator.
the numerator is |x2 -81|, which is the absolute value of a number.
so, it's always non-negative, and it's zero at x = 9 and x = -9.
so in the interval (0, 36), the numerator is |x2 -81|.
let's see, between x = 0 and x = 9, x2 is between 0 and 81, so x2 -81 is between -81 and 0.
taking absolute value, it becomes 81 - x2, so positive.
similarly, between x = 9 and x = 36, x2 is between 81 and 1296, so x2 -81 is positive, so absolute value is x2 -81.
so in the entire interval (0, 36), except x =9, the numerator is positive.
at x=9, numerator is zero.
therefore, the expression is negative on (0, 9) u (9, 36), since numerator is positive and denominator is negative, making the fraction negative.
at x=9, the expression is zero, which does not satisfy the inequality.
therefore, the solution set is (0, 9) u (9, 36).
but hold on, i need to make sure that there aren't any other intervals.
wait, the numerator is non-negative everywhere, denominator is negative only on (0, 36).
therefore, the only place where the expression is negative is when x is in (0, 36) excluding x=9.
therefore, yes, (0,9) u (9,36).
let me check with test values.
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>
<goal>
<outline>
1: the value of the expression at x=1.
</outline>
<outline>
2: the value of the expression at x=9.
</outline>
<outline>
3: the value of the expression at x=10.
</outline>
</goal>
<path>
1: a test value of x=1 is chosen, which is within the interval (0,9). the numerator, |1^2 - 81|, evaluates to |1 - 81|, which is |-80|, resulting in 80. the denominator, 1^2 - 36*1, calculates to 1 - 36, yielding -35. the expression's value is 80 / -35, which is approximately -2.285, a negative number.
</path>
<path>
2: at x=9, the numerator is |9^2 - 81| = |81 - 81| = 0, resulting in a value of 0.
</path>
<path>
3: at x=10, the numerator |10^2 - 81| evaluates to |100 - 81|, which is 19. the denominator 10^2 - 36*10 becomes 100 - 360, resulting in -260. the expression value is 19/-260, approximately -0.073, which is less than 0.
</path>
<conclusion>
the expression evaluates to approximately -2.285 at x=1, 0 at x=9, and approximately -0.073 at x=10.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
similarly, at x = 35, numerator is |1225 -81| = 1144, denominator is 35^2 -36*35 = 35*(35 -36) = 35*(-1) = -35, so 1144 / (-35) ≈ -32.685, which is negative.
so, in the interval (0, 36), except x=9, the expression is negative.
at x=9, it's zero.
therefore, solution is (0, 9) u (9, 36).
but let's check x values outside (0, 36).
for example, x = -1.
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>
<goal>
<outline>
1: the sign of the expression evaluated at x=-1.
</outline>
<outline>
2: the sign of the expression evaluated at x=40.
</outline>
</goal>
<path>
1: the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) is evaluated at x=-1. the numerator, |(-1)^2 - 81|, simplifies to |1 - 81|, which is |-80|, resulting in 80. the denominator, (-1)^2 - 36*(-1), calculates to 1 + 36, yielding 37. the expression value is 80/37, approximately 2.162, a positive number, meaning it does not satisfy the inequality.
</path>
<path>
2: the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) is evaluated at x=40, resulting in \(\frac{|40^2 - 81|}{40^2 - 36*40}\), which simplifies to \(\frac{|1600 - 81|}{1600 - 1440}\) or \(\frac{1519}{160}\), a positive value. this confirms the expression is positive for x > 36.
</path>
<conclusion>
the expression evaluates to a positive value at x=-1, indicating the inequality is not satisfied for x < 0. the expression also evaluates to a positive value at x=40, confirming the inequality is not satisfied for x > 36.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
therefore, outside of (0, 36), the expression is positive, so those intervals are not part of the solution.
therefore, the solution set is (0, 9) u (9, 36).
but wait, the question is written as x2 -36x, which is x(x -36).
so, when x is between 0 and 36, that expression is negative.
so, yes, the fraction is negative there except where numerator is zero.
but just to make sure, let me check another point near x=9.
let's take x=8.
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>
<goal>
<outline>
1: the value of the expression at x=8.
</outline>
<outline>
2: the value of the expression at x=10.
</outline>
</goal>
<path>
1: at x=8, the numerator is |8^2 - 81|, which evaluates to |64 - 81|, resulting in |-17|, or 17. the denominator is 8^2 - 36*8, calculated as 64 - 288, yielding -224. the expression value is 17/-224, approximately -0.0759, which is less than 0.
</path>
<path>
2: at x=10, the numerator |x^2 - 81| evaluates to |100 - 81|, which is 19. the denominator x^2 - 36x evaluates to 100 - 360, which is -260. the expression value is 19 / (-260), approximately -0.073, confirming it is negative.
</path>
<conclusion>
the expression evaluates to approximately -0.0759 at x=8 and approximately -0.073 at x=10, both of which are negative values.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
so, in both cases, negative.
so the expression is indeed negative on (0, 9) and (9, 36).
therefore, the solution set is the union of these two intervals, not including 9, and not including 0 and 36, which are the points where the denominator is zero.
so, in interval notation, that would be (0, 9) u (9, 36).
therefore, i think that's the answer.
but let me check once more if there's any mistake.
wait, another way to approach absolute value inequalities.
maybe i missed something?
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>
<goal>
<outline>
1: the definition of the absolute value function \(|x^2 - 81|\).
</outline>
<outline>
2: the definition of the absolute value function \(|x^2 - 81|\) on the interval \(x \in (0, 9)\).
</outline>
<outline>
3: the definition of the absolute value function \(|x^2 - 81|\) on the interval \(x \in (9, 36)\).
</outline>
</goal>
<path>
1: the absolute value function \(|x^2 - 81|\) can be expressed as a piecewise function: it equals \(x^2 - 81\) when \(x^2 - 81 \geq 0\), and equals \(81 - x^2\) otherwise.
</path>
<path>
2: for the interval \(x \in (0, 9)\), the expression \(x^2 - 81\) is negative, so the absolute value \(|x^2 - 81|\) is equivalent to \(-(x^2 - 81)\), which simplifies to \(81 - x^2\).
</path>
<path>
3: for values of \(x\) in the interval \((9, 36)\), the expression \(x^2 - 81\) is positive, resulting in \(|x^2 - 81| = x^2 - 81\).
</path>
<conclusion>
the function \(|x^2 - 81|\) is equivalent to \(81 - x^2\) for \(x \in (0, 9)\) and \(x^2 - 81\) for \(x \in (9, 36)\).
</conclusion>
</parallel>
therefore, we can split the inequality into two cases based on the definition of absolute value.
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>
<goal>
<outline>
1: the inequality for the case \(x^2 \geq 81\).
</outline>
<outline>
2: the inequality for the case \(x^2 < 81\).
</outline>
</goal>
<path>
1: the first case is when \(x^2 \geq 81\), which implies \(|x^2 - 81| = x^2 - 81\). the inequality then becomes \(\frac{x^2 - 81}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\). the numerator, \(x^2 - 81\), factors into \((x - 9)(x + 9)\), and the denominator, \(x^2 - 36x\), factors into \(x(x - 36)\). the critical points for this case are x = -9, 0, 9, and 36, which divide the real number line into intervals where the expression's sign can be determined. the condition \(x^2 \geq 81\) restricts the domain for this case to \(x \leq -9\) or \(x \geq 9\).
</path>
<path>
2: for the case \(x^2 < 81\), the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\) is equivalent to \(\frac{81 - x^2}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\).
</path>
<conclusion>
the inequality splits into two cases based on the definition of the absolute value numerator: \(\frac{x^2 - 81}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\) for \(x^2 \geq 81\), and \(\frac{81 - x^2}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\) for \(x^2 < 81\).
</conclusion>
</parallel>
case 1: x ≤ -9 or x ≥ 9
then the inequality is \(\frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)} < 0\)
we need to solve this inequality under the condition that x ≤ -9 or x ≥ 9.
so first, let's note all the critical points where numerator or denominator is zero.
numerator is zero at x = 9 and x = -9.
denominator is zero at x = 0 and x = 36.
so these points divide the real line into intervals.
but considering our case 1 is x ≤ -9 or x ≥ 9, so we need to analyze the sign of the expression in those regions.
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>
<goal>
<outline>
1: the sign analysis of the expression \(\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}\) for the condition \(x \leq -9\).
</outline>
<outline>
2: the sign analysis of the expression \(\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}\) for the condition \(x \geq 9\).
</outline>
</goal>
<path>
1: for \(x \leq -9\), the numerator \((x - 9)(x + 9)\) is positive since \(x \leq -9\) implies \(x+9 \leq 0\) and \(x-9 \leq -18 < 0\); the product of two negative terms is positive. the denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is positive because \(x \leq -9\) (negative) and \(x - 36 \leq -45\) (negative); the product of two negative terms is positive. the overall expression \(\frac{+}{+}\) is positive, which does not satisfy the inequality \(< 0\). the interval \(x \leq -9\) is therefore not part of the solution.
</path>
<path>
2: for \(x \geq 9\), the numerator \((x-9)(x+9)\) is non-negative since \(x \geq 9\). the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative for \(9 \leq x < 36\) and positive for \(x > 36\). the expression \(\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}\) is therefore negative for \(9 \leq x < 36\) and positive for \(x > 36\). when \(x = 9\), the numerator is zero, making the expression equal to 0, which is not less than 0. for \(9 < x < 36\), the numerator \((x-9)(x+9)\) is positive, and the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative, resulting in a negative expression. for \(x > 36\), the numerator is positive and the denominator is positive, making the expression positive. the solution for this case is the interval \(9 < x < 36\).
</path>
<conclusion>
the expression \(\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}\) is positive for \(x \leq -9\) and negative for \(9 < x < 36\). the inequality \(< 0\) is not satisfied for \(x \leq -9\), but is satisfied for \(9 < x < 36\).
</conclusion>
</parallel>
case 2: when x2 < 81, which is when -9 < x < 9.
then the inequality becomes \(\frac{81 - x^2}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\).
which is \(\frac{-(x^2 - 81)}{x(x - 36)} < 0\), which is \(\frac{-(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)} < 0\), which is equivalent to \(\frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)} > 0\) after multiplying both sides by -1 and reversing the inequality sign.
so in this case, we need the expression \(\frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}\) to be positive.
now, in the interval -9 < x < 9, let's analyze the sign of each factor.
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>
<goal>
<outline>
1: the sign of the factor \(x-9\) for \(x \in (-9, 9)\).

2: the sign of the factor \(x+9\) for \(x \in (-9, 9)\).
</outline>
<outline>
3: the sign of the factor \(x\) for \(x \in (-9, 9)\).
</outline>
<outline>
4: the sign of the factor \(x-36\) for \(x \in (-9, 9)\).
</outline>
</goal>
<path>
1: for \(x\) in the interval \((-9, 9)\), the factor \(x - 9\) is negative.
</path>
<path>
2: for \(x \in (-9, 9)\), the factor \(x + 9\) is positive, as \(x > -9\).
</path>
<path>
3: the factor \(x\), for \(x \in (-9, 9)\), is negative when \(x \in (-9, 0)\) and positive when \(x \in (0, 9)\).
</path>
<path>
4: the factor \(x - 36\) is negative for all values of \(x\) in the interval \((-9, 9)\).
</path>
<conclusion>
for \(x \in (-9, 9)\), the factors \(x-9\) and \(x-36\) are negative, and the factor \(x+9\) is positive. the sign of the factor \(x\) is negative for \(x \in (-9, 0)\) and positive for \(x \in (0, 9)\).
</conclusion>
</parallel>
let's think in parallel.

</goal>
<path>
1: for \(x \in (-9, 0)\), the numerator \((x-9)(x+9)\) is negative, as \((x-9)\) is negative and \((x+9)\) is positive. the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is positive, because \(x\) is negative and \((x-36)\) is negative, resulting in a product of two negative terms. the expression \(\frac{-}{+}\) is negative, which is less than 0.
</path>
<path>
2: for \(x \in (0, 9)\), the numerator \((x-9)(x+9)\) is negative (since \(x-9 < 0\) and \(x+9 > 0\)), and the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is also negative (since \(x > 0\) and \(x-36 < 0\)). the product of two negative terms results in a positive expression.
</path>
<conclusion>
the expression \(\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}\) is negative for \(x \in (-9, 0)\) and positive for \(x \in (0, 9)\).
</conclusion>
</parallel>
so, in the interval (0, 9), the expression is positive, which satisfies the case 2 inequality (expression > 0).
but we need to remember that case 2 is when x is in (-9, 9).
therefore, combining these, in the interval (0, 9), the expression is positive, so it satisfies case 2.
however, in (-9, 0), the expression is negative, so it does not satisfy the case 2 inequality (which requires expression > 0).
therefore, in case 2 (when x is between -9 and 9), the inequality holds when x is in (0, 9).
but wait, also note that in case 2, x is in (-9, 9), and the denominator is x(x -36).
at x =0, the denominator is zero, which is undefined.
so in the interval (0, 9), we have to exclude x=0, but x=0 is not in (0,9), so it's already excluded.
similarly, x=36 is not in this interval.
therefore, from case 2, the solution is (0, 9).
wait, but when x is in (-9, 0), the expression is negative, but case 2 requires the expression to be positive.
so (-9, 0) is not part of the solution.
therefore, case 2 contributes (0, 9) to the solution.
case 1 contributed (9, 36).
therefore, combining both cases, we have (0, 9) u (9, 36).
which matches what i concluded earlier.
therefore, this seems correct.
therefore, the solution set is (0, 9) u (9, 36).
therefore, i can conclude that.
but just to double-check, take a test point in (0, 9), like x=1: as before, it's negative, satisfies the inequality.
take a point in (9, 36), like x=10: also negative.
points outside these intervals: x=-1, positive; x=9: zero; x=36: undefined.
all checks out.
therefore, the answer is (0, 9) u (9, 36).
in interval notation, that's how it's written.
so, yes.
**final answer**
the solution is \(\boxed{(0, 9) \cup (9, 36)}\).
</think>

answer: to solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the critical points and intervals where the expression is negative.

1. **numerator analysis**:
   - the numerator is \(|x^2 - 81|\), which is always non-negative and zero at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\).

2. **denominator analysis**:
   - the denominator \(x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36)\) is zero at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\), making the expression undefined at these points.
   - the denominator is negative when \(0 < x < 36\).

3. **critical points and intervals**:
   - the critical points are \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), \(x = 9\), and \(x = 36\).
   - these points divide the real line into intervals: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

4. **sign analysis**:
   - the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is non-negative and zero at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\).
   - the denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is negative for \(0 < x < 36\).

5. **case analysis**:
   - for \(x\) in \((0, 36)\), the denominator is negative. the numerator is zero at \(x = 9\) and positive otherwise.
   - the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) is negative when the denominator is negative and the numerator is positive, i.e., in \((0, 9)\) and \((9, 36)\).

6. **exclusion of critical points**:
   - at \(x = 9\), the expression is zero, which does not satisfy the inequality.
   - at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\), the expression is undefined.

combining these results, the solution to the inequality is \((0, 9) \cup (9, 36)\).

\(\boxed{(0, 9) \cup (9, 36)}\)

参考答案: (0,9) \cup (9,36)
