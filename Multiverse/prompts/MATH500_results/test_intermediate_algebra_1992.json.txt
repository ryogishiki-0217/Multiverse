Okay, so I need to solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\).
Hmm, let's break this down step by step.
First, inequalities involving absolute values and rational expressions can be a bit tricky, so I need to be careful.
Let me recall that the absolute value expression \(|x^2 - 81|\) will always be non-negative, meaning it's either zero or positive.
But since it's in the numerator, and we have a fraction less than zero, that means the entire fraction must be negative.
A fraction is negative when the numerator and denominator have opposite signs.
However, since the numerator here is an absolute value, which is non-negative, the only way the fraction can be negative is if the denominator is negative.
Because then the numerator (which is non-negative) divided by a negative denominator gives a non-positive result.
Wait, but we need the fraction to be strictly less than zero, so the numerator must not be zero when the denominator is negative.
If the numerator is zero, the entire fraction would be zero, which doesn't satisfy the inequality (since zero is not less than zero).
So, actually, the fraction will be negative if and only if the denominator is negative and the numerator is positive.
But the numerator here is an absolute value, so the numerator is zero when \(x^2 - 81 = 0\), which is when \(x = \pm9\).
At all other points, the numerator is positive.
Therefore, the fraction is negative when the denominator is negative, except at the points where the numerator is zero (since at those points, the fraction is zero, which doesn't satisfy the inequality).
So, first, let's factor the denominator to understand where it's negative.
The denominator is \(x^2 - 36x\).
Let me factor that: \(x(x - 36)\).
So, the denominator is \(x(x - 36)\).
Now, I need to determine where this denominator is negative.
Let's think in parallel.

</Path>
<Path>
2: The denominator is positive if x is between 0 and 36. This is because for 0 < x < 36, the term x is positive and (x-36) is negative. The product of a positive and a negative term is negative, which means the denominator x(x-36) is negative for 0 < x < 36.
</Path>
<Path>
3: For x values greater than 36, both factors x and (x-36) are positive, resulting in a positive denominator.

The denominator x(x-36) is positive when x < 0, negative when 0 < x < 36, and positive again when x > 36.

<Conclusion>
The denominator x(x-36) is positive when x < 0, negative when 0 < x < 36, and positive again when x > 36.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So denominator is negative when 0 < x < 36.
But we must also ensure that the numerator is not zero.
The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is zero at x = ±9.
So at x = 9, the numerator is zero, which would make the fraction zero, and at x = -9, the numerator is also zero.
However, x = -9 is not in the interval where the denominator is negative (0 < x < 36).
So only x = 9 is in that interval.
Therefore, we need to exclude x = 9 from the solution.
Also, the original expression has a denominator, so we must exclude any points where the denominator is zero, which are x = 0 and x = 36.
But x = 0 is not in the interval 0 < x < 36, but x = 36 is an endpoint.
So the denominator is zero at x = 0 and x = 36, which are already excluded from the interval where the denominator is negative.
Therefore, putting this all together: the fraction is negative when 0 < x < 36, excluding the points where the numerator is zero (x = 9) and the points where the denominator is zero (x = 0 and x = 36).
But since x = -9 is not in the interval 0 < x < 36, we don't need to worry about that.
Therefore, the solution should be the interval 0 < x < 36, excluding x = 9.
Wait, but let me check with specific values to make sure.
Let's think in parallel.

1: For x=1, the numerator |1^2 - 81| evaluates to 80, and the denominator 1^2 - 36*1 evaluates to -35. The fraction 80/(-35) simplifies to -16/7, which is less than 0, satisfying the inequality.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The numerator |x^2-81| evaluates to |81-81| = 0 when x=9, making the fraction 0, which does not satisfy the inequality. This point is therefore not included in the solution.
</Path>
<Path>
3: The value x=10, which is within the interval (0,36) and not equal to 9, is selected for testing. The numerator is |10^2 - 81| = |100 - 81| = |19| = 19. The denominator is 10^2 - 36*10 = 100 - 360 = -260. The fraction is 19 / (-260) = -19/260, which is less than 0. This confirms that x=10 satisfies the inequality.
</Path>
<Path>
4: When x=36, the denominator x(x-36) becomes zero, rendering the expression undefined. Therefore, x=36 is not part of the solution set.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The value x=1 satisfies the inequality, x=9 does not, x=10 satisfies the inequality, and x=36 is undefined, confirming that the inequality holds for values in (0,36) except x=9.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So the solution set is all x such that 0 < x < 9 or 9 < x < 36.
So in interval notation, that would be (0, 9) union (9, 36).
But let me double-check if there's any other critical points.
The absolute value in the numerator doesn't cause sign changes, since it's always non-negative.
But maybe I need to consider where the expression inside the absolute value changes sign?
Wait, the numerator is |x^2 -81|, which is |(x-9)(x+9)|.
So the expression inside the absolute value changes sign at x = -9 and x = 9.
But since we are only considering the intervals where the denominator is negative, which is 0 < x < 36, except x = 0 and x = 36.
Within this interval, the key points are x = 9, where the numerator is zero, and x = 0 and 36 where denominator is zero.
So within 0 < x < 36, the numerator |x^2 -81| is zero at x = 9, positive elsewhere.
So in the interval 0 < x < 9, the numerator is positive, denominator is negative (as established earlier), so the fraction is negative.
Similarly, in 9 < x < 36, numerator is positive, denominator is negative, fraction is negative.
At x = 9, the fraction is zero.
At x = 0 and 36, the fraction is undefined.
Therefore, combining these, the solution is 0 < x < 9 or 9 < x < 36.
So (0,9) U (9,36).
Yes, that seems right.
Let me check with another value in the interval 0 < x < 9.
Let's take x = 1.
Let's think in parallel.

</Path>
<Conclusion>
The value x=1 satisfies the inequality, confirming the interval (0,9) is part of the solution set.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Now, let's check x = 10, which is in (9,36).
Let's think in parallel.

</Path>
<Conclusion>
The value x=10 satisfies the inequality, confirming the interval (9,36) is part of the solution set.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So both intervals work.
Let's think in parallel.

1: For x=9, the numerator |x^2 - 81| evaluates to |81 - 81|, which is 0. Consequently, the fraction becomes 0, and since the inequality requires the expression to be less than 0, x=9 is not included in the solution set.
</Path>
<Path>
2: When x=36, the denominator x^2 - 36x evaluates to 0, rendering the fraction undefined. Consequently, x=36 is not included in the solution set.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The value x=9 is excluded from the solution set because the fraction equals 0, and x=36 is excluded because the fraction is undefined.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Therefore, the solution is (0,9) U (9,36).
Let me confirm once more.
The fraction is negative when denominator is negative and numerator is positive.
Numerator is positive except at x=9 and x=-9.
Denominator is negative when 0 < x < 36.
So intersection of where denominator is negative and numerator is positive is 0 < x <36 except x=9 and x=-9.
But since x=-9 is not in 0 <x <36, the only point to exclude is x=9.
Therefore, the solution is (0,9) U (9,36).
Yes, that makes sense.
No other intervals to consider.
So final answer should be \(\boxed{(0, 9) \cup (9, 36)}\).
**Final Answer** 
The final answer is \boxed{(0, 9) \cup (9, 36)}.
</Think>

Answer: To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to determine where the fraction is negative. 

1. **Numerator Analysis**:
   - The numerator is \(|x^2 - 81|\), which is always non-negative. It is zero when \(x = \pm 9\) and positive otherwise.

2. **Denominator Analysis**:
   - The denominator is \(x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36)\). We need to determine where this expression is negative.
   - The roots of the denominator are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). The denominator is negative when \(0 < x < 36\).

3. **Combining Conditions**:
   - The fraction is negative if the denominator is negative and the numerator is positive.
   - The numerator is positive except at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). Since \(x = -9\) is not in the interval \(0 < x < 36\), we only need to exclude \(x = 9\) from this interval.

4. **Exclusion Points**:
   - At \(x = 9\), the numerator is zero, making the fraction zero. This point is excluded.
   - The denominator is zero at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\), which are already excluded from the interval \(0 < x < 36\).

5. **Solution Intervals**:
   - The fraction is negative for \(0 < x < 9\) and \(9 < x < 36\).

Thus, the solution to the inequality is \(\boxed{(0, 9) \cup (9, 36)}\).

answer: to solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to determine where the fraction is negative. 

1. **numerator analysis**:
   - the numerator is \(|x^2 - 81|\), which is always non-negative. it is zero when \(x = \pm 9\) and positive otherwise.

2. **denominator analysis**:
   - the denominator is \(x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36)\). we need to determine where this expression is negative.
   - the roots of the denominator are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). the denominator is negative when \(0 < x < 36\).

3. **combining conditions**:
   - the fraction is negative if the denominator is negative and the numerator is positive.
   - the numerator is positive except at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). since \(x = -9\) is not in the interval \(0 < x < 36\), we only need to exclude \(x = 9\) from this interval.

4. **exclusion points**:
   - at \(x = 9\), the numerator is zero, making the fraction zero. this point is excluded.
   - the denominator is zero at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\), which are already excluded from the interval \(0 < x < 36\).

5. **solution intervals**:
   - the fraction is negative for \(0 < x < 9\) and \(9 < x < 36\).

thus, the solution to the inequality is \(\boxed{(0, 9) \cup (9, 36)}\)
