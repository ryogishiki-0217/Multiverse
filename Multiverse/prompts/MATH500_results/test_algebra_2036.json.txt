Okay, so I need to find the distance between the points (2, -6) and (-4, 3). I remember that the distance formula for two points in a coordinate plane is kind of like the Pythagorean theorem. Let me think... If the two points are (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), the distance between them is sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2). Yeah, that sounds right. It's similar to finding the hypotenuse of a right triangle where the legs are the differences in the x-coordinates and y-coordinates.
Alright, so first I should identify the coordinates of the two points. Let's call the first point (x1, y1) = (2, -6) and the second point (x2, y2) = (-4, 3). Then plug these into the formula.
So, computing the differences first: x2 - x1 would be -4 - 2 = -6. And y2 - y1 would be 3 - (-6) = 3 + 6 = 9. Then, I square each of these differences: (-6)^2 is 36, and 9^2 is 81. Adding those together: 36 + 81 = 117. Then, take the square root of 117. So the distance is sqrt(117).
Wait, but the problem says to express the answer in simplest radical form. Hmm, is sqrt(117) simplified? Let me check. I need to see if 117 has any square factors. Let's think in parallel.

2: 117 divided by 3 is 39, so 117 = 3 * 39. Then 39 is 3 * 13. So, 117 factors into 3 * 3 * 13, which is 3^2 * 13. Therefore, sqrt(117) can be simplified by extracting the square factor. This is because 117 can be expressed as 9 multiplied by 13, where 9 is a perfect square. The square root of 9 is 3, so sqrt(117) equals sqrt(9 * 13), which simplifies to 3 * sqrt(13).

4: The divisibility of 117 by 5 is considered. A number divisible by 5 ends with 0 or 5, 117 does not end with 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

5: The divisibility of 117 by 9 is checked. The sum of the digits of 117 is 1 + 1 + 7, which equals 9. Since 9 is divisible by 9, 117 is divisible by 9. The division of 117 by 9 yields 13.
</Path>
<Path>
6: The number 117 is checked for divisibility by 13. Dividing 117 by 13 yields approximately 9, with a remainder of 0. The division 13 * 9 = 117 confirms that 117 is divisible by 13. The quotient is 9, which is not a perfect square. Consequently, 13 is not a square factor.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The number 117 is not divisible by 2, 4, or 5. It is divisible by 3, 9, and 13. The factorization 117 = 3^2 * 13 confirms that 3 is a square factor.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So, sqrt(117) = sqrt(9 * 13) = sqrt(9) * sqrt(13) = 3*sqrt(13). Therefore, the simplified radical form is 3*sqrt(13). Let me verify that again. 9*13=117, yes. And since 13 is prime and doesn't have any square factors, that's as simple as it gets.
Therefore, the distance between the points (2, -6) and (-4, 3) is 3*sqrt(13) units. I should probably recheck my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So coordinates: (2, -6) and (-4, 3). Compute x2 - x1: -4 - 2 = -6; absolute value is 6, but since we square it, sign doesn't matter. Similarly, y2 - y1: 3 - (-6) = 9. Then (-6)^2 = 36, 9^2 = 81. 36 + 81 = 117. sqrt(117) = 3*sqrt(13). Yeah, that all checks out. Another thing to check—sometimes if the points are switched, but no, distance is commutative, so it's the same. Also, making sure that 117 doesn't have other square factors besides 9. Let's see, does 117 divided by 4? No. 117 divided by 9 is 13, as we saw. 13 is prime. So factor of 9 and 13. So, 3*sqrt(13) is good. So, I believe that's correct. The answer is 3*sqrt(13).
the final answer is 3\sqrt{13}

Answer: To find the distance between the points \((2, -6)\) and \((-4, 3)\), we use the distance formula:
\[
\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]
Substituting the given coordinates \((x_1, y_1) = (2, -6)\) and \((x_2, y_2) = (-4, 3)\):
\[
\sqrt{((-4) - 2)^2 + (3 - (-6))^2}
\]
Simplifying the differences:
\[
\sqrt{(-6)^2 + 9^2}
\]
Calculating the squares:
\[
\sqrt{36 + 81} = \sqrt{117}
\]
Simplifying \(\sqrt{117}\) by factoring out the perfect square:
\[
\sqrt{9 \times 13} = \sqrt{9} \times \sqrt{13} = 3\sqrt{13}
\]
Thus, the distance between the points is \(\boxed{3\sqrt{13}}\).

the final answer is \boxed{3\sqrt{13}}
