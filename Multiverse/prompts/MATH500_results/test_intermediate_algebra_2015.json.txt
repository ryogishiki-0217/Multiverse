Okay, so I need to find the set of all possible unordered pairs of the form αiαj + αkαl where α1, α2, α3, α4 are the roots of the equation x4 + 2x3 + 2 = 0.
Since the problem is asking for an unordered set, the order of the elements doesn't matter, but each element in the set is one of those combinations.
First, maybe I should recall Vieta's formulas.
For a quartic equation x4 + ax3 + bx2 + cx + d = 0, the sums and products of roots can be related to the coefficients.
Let me write down what Vieta's formulas tell us here.
Given the equation x4 + 2x3 + 0x2 + 0x + 2 = 0, comparing with the general form, we have:
a = 2, b = 0, c = 0, d = 2.
Then, Vieta's formulas say:
1. α1 + α2 + α3 + α4 = -a = -2
2. α1α2 + α1α3 + α1α4 + α2α3 + α2α4 + α3α4 = b = 0
3. α1α2α3 + α1α2α4 + α1α3α4 + α2α3α4 = -c = 0
4. α1α2α3α4 = d = 2
So, the sum of roots is -2, the sum of pairwise products is 0, the sum of triple products is 0, and the product of all roots is 2.
The problem is asking for the set {α1α2 + α3α4, α1α3 + α2α4, α1α4 + α2α3}.
Each of these terms is a sum of two products of pairs of roots.
Since the original sum of all pairwise products is 0, maybe these three terms are related to each other?
Let me think.
Let's denote S1 = α1α2 + α3α4, S2 = α1α3 + α2α4, S3 = α1α4 + α2α3.
Then, the set we need is {S1, S2, S3}.
Note that S1 + S2 + S3 = (α1α2 + α3α4) + (α1α3 + α2α4) + (α1α4 + α2α3) = α1α2 + α1α3 + α1α4 + α2α3 + α2α4 + α3α4 = 0, from Vieta's formula.
So the sum of these three terms is 0.
Therefore, if we can find two of them, the third is determined.
But the problem is to find all three.
Alternatively, perhaps we can find the polynomial equation with roots S1, S2, S3?
Since the roots are symmetric, maybe these S's are roots of a cubic equation.
To form the cubic equation, we need the sums S1 + S2 + S3, which is 0, the sum of products S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3, and the product S1S2S3.
We already know the sum is 0.
Let's compute the sum of the products of two at a time.
Let's think in parallel.

1: The product S1S2, defined as (α1α2 + α3α4)(α1α3 + α2α4), is expanded to α1^2α2α3 + α1α2^2α4 + α1α3α4^2 + α2α3α4^2. This expression is recognized as the sum of terms corresponding to the product of two distinct roots multiplied by the squares of the other two roots.

2: The product S1S3 is (α1α2 + α3α4)(α1α4 + α2α3). Expanding this product yields α1α2α1α4 + α1α2α2α3 + α3α4α1α4 + α3α4α2α3. This expression simplifies to α1²α2α4 + α1α2²α3 + α1α3α4² + α2α3²α4.

The expansions for the pairwise products S1S2, S1S3, and S2S3, each resulting in four terms, have been derived.

Therefore, S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 is equal to:
[α12α2α3 + α1α22α3 + α1α2α32 + α1α2α3α4] + [α12α3α4 + α1α22α4 + α1α32α4 + α23α4] + [α12α2α4 + α1α22α3 + α1α3α42 + α2α32α4] + [α1α2α3α4]
Wait, actually, no.
Wait, let's look at each S1S2, S1S3, S2S3:
From S1S2:
α12α2α3 + α1α22α4 + α1α32α4 + α2α3α42
From S1S3:

From S2S3:
α12α3α4 + α1α22α4 + α1α32α4 + α23α4

Wait, maybe this approach is getting too complicated.
Maybe there's a smarter way.
Alternatively, note that each of S1, S2, S3 can be considered as (sum of products of roots two at a time) minus the product of a specific pair.
For example, S1 = α1α2 + α3α4 = (α1α2 + α1α3 + α1α4 + α2α3 + α2α4 + α3α4) - (α1α3 + α1α4 + α2α3 + α2α4).
But since the total sum of pairwise products is 0, S1 = - (α1α3 + α1α4 + α2α3 + α2α4).
Wait, but then S1 would be related to other sums.
Hmm, but maybe not.
Alternatively, perhaps express S1, S2, S3 in terms of elementary symmetric polynomials.
Wait, the elementary symmetric polynomials here are:
e1 = α1 + α2 + α3 + α4 = -2
e2 = α1α2 + α1α3 + ... + α3α4 = 0
e3 = α1α2α3 + ... + α2α3α4 = 0
e4 = α1α2α3α4 = 2
We need to express each S1, S2, S3 in terms of these.
For example, S1 = α1α2 + α3α4.
But since e2 = 0, we have α1α2 + α1α3 + α1α4 + α2α3 + α2α4 + α3α4 = 0.
Therefore, α1α2 + α3α4 = - (α1α3 + α1α4 + α2α3 + α2α4).
But α1α3 + α1α4 + α2α3 + α2α4 = (α1 + α2)(α3 + α4).
Let me see:
Let’s denote (α1 + α2)(α3 + α4) = α1α3 + α1α4 + α2α3 + α2α4.
Therefore, S1 = - (α1 + α2)(α3 + α4).
Similarly, maybe S2 = - (α1 + α3)(α2 + α4), and S3 = - (α1 + α4)(α2 + α3).
Therefore, the set {S1, S2, S3} is equal to the set {- (α1 + α2)(α3 + α4), - (α1 + α3)(α2 + α4), - (α1 + α4)(α2 + α3)}.
Therefore, if we can find the possible values of (α_i + α_j)(α_k + α_l) for distinct i, j, k, l, then the required set is the negatives of those.
Alternatively, perhaps these products are related to the elementary symmetric polynomials.
Let’s see.
Let me denote s1 = α1 + α2, s2 = α1 + α3, s3 = α1 + α4, s4 = α2 + α3, s5 = α2 + α4, s6 = α3 + α4.
Then, the S1, S2, S3 correspond to -s1*s2 something?
Wait, maybe not.
Wait, S1 = -(sum of products of roots taken two at a time excluding α1α2 and α3α4).
Wait, actually, S1 is defined as α1α2 + α3α4.
But in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials, maybe we can write S1 + S2 + S3 = 0, which we already know.
But maybe we can compute (for example) the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.
Alternatively, note that (s1 + s2 + s3 + s4 + s5 + s6)^2 would be equal to something.
Wait, actually, each of s1 to s6 is the sum of two roots.
Since the sum of all roots is -2, if we take s1 = α1 + α2, then the sum of the other two roots is -2 - s1.
But maybe that can help.
Wait, let's compute all pairwise sums.
If we denote S = α1 + α2 + α3 + α4 = -2.
Then, if we take any two roots, say α1 and α2, then (α1 + α2) + (α3 + α4) = S = -2.
So if we let t1 = α1 + α2, then t2 = α3 + α4 = -2 - t1.
Similarly, if we take other pairs, the same relationship holds.
Therefore, perhaps the products (α1 + α2)(α3 + α4) can be written as t*(-2 - t), where t is α1 + α2.
So then, each term like (α1 + α2)(α3 + α4) is equal to -t^2 - 2t.
But if we can find the possible values of t, which is the sum of two roots.
Let's think in parallel.

The square of the sum of all roots, (α1 + α2 + α3 + α4)², is equal to S², which is (-2)² = 4. The expansion of this square is α1² + α2² + α3² + α4² + 2(α1α2 + α1α3 + α1α4 + α2α3 + α2α4 + α3α4). This expansion can be written as the sum of the squares of the roots plus twice the sum of the pairwise products of the roots, which is 4.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The sum of the products (α_i + α_j)(α_k + α_l) for distinct i, j, k, l can be found using two distinct methods: one involving the sum of the products directly, and the other using the expansion of the square of the sum of all roots.

But the sum of pairwise products is e2 = 0.
Therefore:
4 = α12 + α22 + α32 + α42 + 2*0
So sum of squares of roots is 4.
Let’s note that.
Sum α12 + α22 + α32 + α42 = 4.
Now, let's compute the sum of all (αi + αj)(αk + αl) where {i,j,k,l} is a permutation of 1,2,3,4.
How many such terms are there?
For four roots, the number of ways to partition them into two pairs is 3.
For example, the pairs can be (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23).
So there are three such terms, which correspond to our S1, S2, S3.
But we can compute the sum of these three terms, which is 0, as we saw earlier.
But maybe we can compute the sum of their squares, i.e., S12 + S22 + S32.
Wait, but since S1 + S2 + S3 = 0, then (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = 0 = S12 + S22 + S32 + 2(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3).
Therefore, 0 = S12 + S22 + S32 + 2(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3).
But we need to find S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.
Wait, maybe another approach.
Let’s note that each of S1, S2, S3 is equal to (αi + αj)(αk + αl) = αiαk + αiαl + αjαk + αjαl.
But since the sum of all pairwise products is 0, then each S1, S2, S3 must be equal to the negative of the remaining pairwise products.
Wait, maybe not sure.
Alternatively, note that S1 = α1α2 + α3α4.
Let’s compute S12:
S12 = (α1α2 + α3α4)^2 = α12α22 + α32α42 + 2α1α2α3α4.
Similarly for S22 and S32.
Therefore, S12 + S22 + S32 = (α12α22 + α32α42 + 2α1α2α3α4) + (α12α32 + α22α42 + 2α1α2α3α4) + (α12α42 + α22α32 + 2α1α2α3α4)
But since each S1, S2, S3 contributes two terms for the product α1α2α3α4.
Since the product of all roots is 2, so α1α2α3α4 = 2.
Therefore, each 2α1α2α3α4 = 2*2 = 4.
Since there are three such terms, the total for those is 3*4 = 12.
Then, the sum S12 + S22 + S32 = (sum of the squares terms) + 12.
Now, compute the sum of squares terms:
α12α22 + α32α42 + α12α32 + α22α42 + α12α42 + α22α32.
Hmm, how can we compute this?
Let’s note that the product of all roots is 2, so α1α2α3α4 = 2.
Therefore, (α1α2α3α4)^2 = 4.
So α12α22α32α42 = 4.
Therefore, for example, α12α22 = 4 / (α32α42).
But not sure if that helps.
Alternatively, we can use the squared sums.
Wait, let's recall that (e2)^2 = (α1α2 + α1α3 + ... + α3α4)^2 = 0.
Expanding that, we get:
sum_{i < j} αi2αj2 + 2 sum_{i < j < k < l} αiαjαkαl = 0.
But the sum of all pairwise products squared plus twice the sum over all distinct quadruplets.
But in our case, the sum of pairwise products squared is e22, which is 0.
But the sum over the quadruplet products, which is the sum over all αiαjαkαl for distinct i,j,k,l.
But each of these products is equal to (α1α2α3α4) * (1/(αm)) where m is the excluded root.
Wait, not sure.
Alternatively, since α1α2α3α4 = 2, so if we have a product missing one root, it's 2 / αm.
Therefore, the sum sum_{i < j < k < l} αiαjαkαl would be equal to sum_{m=1 to 4} 2/αm.
But that is 2 sum_{m=1 to 4} 1/αm.
But let's denote that.
However, to compute this, perhaps we can use the original equation.
The equation is x4 + 2x3 + 0x2 + 0x + 2 = 0.
If we divide both sides by x, we get x3 + 2x2 + 0x + 2 = 0.
But reciprocal roots might help here.
If we let y = 1/x, then the equation in terms of y is:
(1/y)4 + 2(1/y)3 + 0(1/y)2 + 0(1/y) + 2 = 0
Multiply both sides by y4:
1 + 2y + 0y2 + 0y3 + 2y4 = 0
Or, 2y4 + 2y + 1 = 0.
Therefore, the equation for the reciprocals of the roots is 2y4 + 2y + 1 = 0.
But the sum of the reciprocals of the roots is sum_{i=1}^4 1/αi, which by Vieta on the reciprocal equation is - coefficient of y3 / coefficient of y4.
But in the equation 2y4 + 0y3 + 0y2 + 2y +1 = 0, the coefficient of y3 is 0, so sum 1/αi = 0.
Therefore, sum_{i=1}^4 1/αi = 0.
Therefore, sum_{i < j < k < l} αiαjαkαl = 2 sum_{m=1}^4 1/αm = 2 * 0 = 0.
Therefore, going back to (e2)^2 = 0.
Therefore, sum_{i < j} αi2αj2 + 2 * 0 = 0, so sum_{i < j} αi2αj2 = 0.
Therefore, sum of squares of pairwise products of roots is 0.
But how does this help us?
Wait, sum_{i < j} αi2αj2 = 0.
But in our previous computation, the sum S12 + S22 + S32 = (sum of terms like α12α22 + α32α42 + ...) + 12.
But how many terms are in the sum?
Let's list all terms:
The six pairwise products are α1α2, α1α3, α1α4, α2α3, α2α4, α3α4.
When we square S1, S2, S3, each S squared gives two of these products squared and cross terms.
Wait, but maybe a better way is to note that:
We have three terms S12, S22, S32.
Each S1 is a sum of two terms, so S12 has two squared terms and a cross term.
But when we sum over all S12 + S22 + S32, the cross terms will be all the mixed products.
Wait, let's do it manually.
Given S1 = α1α2 + α3α4, S2 = α1α3 + α2α4, S3 = α1α4 + α2α3.
Compute S12 + S22 + S32:
= (α12α22 + α32α42 + 2α1α2α3α4) + (α12α32 + α22α42 + 2α1α3α2α4) + (α12α42 + α22α32 + 2α1α4α2α3)
Simplify:
= (α12α22 + α12α32 + α12α42 + α22α32 + α22α42 + α32α42) + 2(α1α2α3α4 + α1α2α3α4 + α1α2α3α4)
But note that in the cross terms, each term 2α1α2α3α4 appears three times, since there are three S's.
Therefore, the cross terms sum to 6α1α2α3α4.
But since α1α2α3α4 = 2, this is 6*2=12.
The first part is the sum of all possible squares of pairwise products.
Earlier, we found that the sum of (α1α2)^2 + (α1α3)^2 + ... + (α3α4)^2 = 0.
Wait, but that conflicts with the idea that sum of squares is zero only if each term is zero, but the roots are complex.
But since the equation is x4 + 2x3 + 2 = 0, which has complex roots, but products of complex roots can result in complex numbers.
However, since the polynomial has real coefficients, the roots come in conjugate pairs.
Suppose roots are a, b, c, d which can be two pairs of complex conjugates or split into real and complex.
But 4th degree equation with real coefficients: either four real roots (possibly) but in this case, the polynomial is x4 + 2x3 + 2.
Let's check for real roots.
Let f(x) = x4 + 2x3 + 2.
f'(x) = 4x3 +6x2 = 4x2(x + 1.5).
Critical points at x=0 and x=-1.5.
Evaluate f(0) = 2, f(-1.5) = (1.5)^4 + 2*(-1.5)^3 +2 = 5.0625 + 2*(-3.375) +2 = 5.0625 -6.75 + 2 = 0.3125.
So the function has local maximum at x=-1.5 of 0.3125 and local minimum at x=0 of 2.
As x approaches -infty, f(x) approaches +infty, and as x approaches +infty, f(x) also approaches +infty.
Therefore, the function crosses the x-axis once between -infty and -1.5, then has a local maximum of 0.3125 (above the x-axis), then decreases to a local minimum of 2 at x=0 (above x-axis), then increases to infinity.
Therefore, only one real root between -infty and -1.5, and three complex roots (since complex roots come in pairs, it's one real root and three complex roots, but complex roots of a polynomial with real coefficients come in conjugate pairs, so actually, two complex conjugate pairs.
Wait, maybe the user wrote the problem with four distinct roots, but according to the polynomial, perhaps it has one real root and three complex roots, but complex roots can't necessarily form four distinct roots?
Wait, but the problem states "the four distinct roots".
Hmm, maybe I made an error.
Wait, maybe the polynomial is x4 +2x3 + 2.
Let me check if perhaps Descartes' rule of signs can tell us.
For f(x), there is one sign change, so one positive real root.
But wait, f(0)=2, and as x approaches infinity, it's positive, but derivative shows it's increasing after x=0.
Wait, maybe my earlier analysis was wrong.
Wait, derivative f'(x)=4x3 +6x2= x2(4x +6).
Critical points at x=0 and x=-6/4= -1.5.
At x=-1.5, f(-1.5)= (-1.5)^4 + 2*(-1.5)^3 +2= 5.0625 +2*(-3.375) ) +2=5.0625 -6.75 +2=0.3125, as before.
At x=0, f(0)=2.
So function decreases from x=-1.5 to x=0, where it reaches 2, then increases.
So the function approaches infinity as x approaches infinity and as x approaches -infinity.
But since there is a local minimum at x=0 with f(0)=2, which is above the x-axis, and local maximum at x=-1.5 with f(-1.5)=0.3125, also above the x-axis.
Therefore, the function only crosses the x-axis once between -infty and -1.5, since it goes from infinity to 0.3125.
So only one real root, and the other three roots must be complex.
But the problem states "the four distinct roots", but according to this analysis, three of the roots are complex.
So perhaps they are two pairs of complex conjugate roots?
Wait, complex roots come in conjugate pairs for polynomials with real coefficients.
So if there is one real root, then the other three roots must be a pair of complex conjugates and another real root.
But the problem states four distinct roots.
Wait, maybe the real root is distinct and the other three roots are a pair of complex conjugates and another single complex number, but that would violate the conjugate root theorem.
Therefore, unless the polynomial is not set up with real coefficients, but it is.
Therefore, contradiction.
Therefore, perhaps my analysis is wrong.
Wait, maybe I made a mistake.
Let me check again.
The polynomial is x4 + 2x3 + 2.
Let me check f(-2)= (-2)^4 +2*(-2)^3 +2=16 + 2*(-8) +2=16 -16 +2=2.
So at x=-2, f(-2)=2.
So between x=-infty and x=-1.5, the function decreases from infinity to 0.3125.
Then between x=-1.5 and x=0, it decreases to 2, then between x=0 and x= infinity, it increases from 2 to infinity.
Therefore, since at x=-2, f(-2)=2, which is above the x-axis, and at x=-3, f(-3)= (-3)^4 + 2*(-3)^3 +2=81 -54 +2=29.
So still above.
Wait, so when does it cross the x-axis?
Wait, seems like my earlier conclusion is wrong.
Wait, as x approaches -infty, the term x^4 dominates and goes to +infty.
As x approaches -infty, x^4 is very large positive, 2x^3 is also very large positive (since x^3 is negative, but multiplied by 2, but x^4 term dominates).
Wait, no.
Wait, x^4 term dominates as x approaches -infty, so the function goes to +infty.
At x=-1.5, the function is 0.3125.
So between x=-infty and x=-1.5, the function decreases from +infty to 0.3125, so it must cross the x-axis once in that interval.
Wait, but if at x=-2, f(-2)=2, which is higher.
Wait, wait, perhaps my calculus is wrong.
Wait, f(x)=x4 +2x3 +2.
Let's compute derivative f'(x)=4x3 +6x2=x2(4x +6).
So critical points at x=0 and x=-6/4= -1.5.
At x=-1.5, second derivative f''(x)=12x2 + 12x.
At x=-1.5, f''(-1.5)=12*(-1.5)^2 +12*(-1.5)=12*2.25 -18=27 -18=9>0, so it's a local minimum.
Wait, but earlier, I thought x=-1.5 was a local maximum.
Wait, no.
Wait, first derivative test.
To the left of x=-1.5, let's test x=-2: f'(-2)= (-2)^2*(4*(-2) +6)=4*(-8+6)=4*(-2)=-8 <0.
Between x=-1.5 and x=0, f'(x) is x2(4x +6), so 4x +6 is positive because x > -1.5.
So 4x +6 >0, and x2 >=0, so f'(x) >=0, so function is increasing from x=-1.5 to x=0.
Therefore, at x=-1.5, since the function is decreasing before and increasing after, it's a local minimum.
So f(-1.5)=0.3125 is a local minimum.
Then at x=0, which was f(0)=2, and since after x=0, derivative f'(0)=0 (since x=0 is a critical point), but for x>0, 4x +6>0, so f'(x)=x2(4x +6)>0 for x>0, so function is increasing for x>0.
Therefore, the function decreases from -infty to x=-1.5 (local minimum 0.3125), then increases to x=0 (f(0)=2), then continues increasing for x>0.
Therefore, the function crosses the x-axis only once, between -infty and x=-1.5.
Therefore, only one real root, and the other three roots are complex.
But the problem states four distinct roots.
But three of them would have to be complex.
Wait, but complex roots come in pairs.
So if there is one real root, there must be another real root, unless the remaining three roots form a complex conjugate pair and a single root, which is not possible.
Wait, unless the three roots are a triple root, but the problem states four distinct roots.
Therefore, this suggests that maybe all roots are real, but my analysis shows only one real root.
Therefore, contradiction.
Therefore, perhaps my analysis is incorrect.
Wait, maybe the polynomial was written differently.
Wait, user wrote x4 +2x3 +2=0.
Yes, that's the polynomial.
Wait, maybe my mistake is in the derivative.
Wait, f(x)=x4 +2x3 +2.
Then f'(x)=4x3 +6x2.
Yes.
So critical points are at 4x3 +6x3=0 → 10x3=0 → x=0.
Wait, wait, 4x3 +6x2=0 → x2(4x +6)=0 → x=0 or x=-6/4=-1.5.
So critical points at x=-1.5 and x=0.
Wait, then as before, but my earlier conclusion was that there is one real root, but graphs suggest only one real root.
However, the problem states four distinct roots.
Therefore, either the problem is incorrect, or my analysis is wrong.
Alternatively, maybe the polynomial does have four real roots but I miscalculated.
Wait, let's test some values.
Let's compute f(-2)=16 + 16 + 2=34.
f(-1.5)=5.0625 + 2*(-3.375) +2=5.0625 -6.75 +2=0.3125.
f(-1)=1 + (-2) +2=1.
f(0)=2.
So between x=-2 and x=-1.5, function goes from 34 to 0.3125.
Then at x=-1, it's 1, then at x=0, 2.
So still, only crossing once at x < -1.5.
Wait, so maybe there's only one real root.
Then the other three roots are complex.
But the problem says four distinct roots.
Hmmm.
Alternatively, maybe the problem is misstated, or perhaps they are considering multiple roots but the polynomial is square-free.
Let's check if the polynomial is separable.
Compute gcd(f, f').
f is x4 +2x3 +2.
f' is 4x3 +6x2 = x2(4x +6).
The polynomial x4 +2x3 +2 is primitive ( coefficients have gcd 1).

okay, so i need to find the set of all possible unordered pairs of the form αiαj + αkαl where α1, α2, α3, α4 are the roots of the equation x4 + 2x3 + 2 = 0.
since the problem is asking for an unordered set, the order of the elements doesn't matter, but each element in the set is one of those combinations.
first, maybe i should recall vieta's formulas.
for a quartic equation x4 + ax3 + bx2 + cx + d = 0, the sums and products of roots can be related to the coefficients.
let me write down what vieta's formulas tell us here.
given the equation x4 + 2x3 + 0x2 + 0x + 2 = 0, comparing with the general form, we have:
a = 2, b = 0, c = 0, d = 2.
then, vieta's formulas say:
1. α1 + α2 + α3 + α4 = -a = -2
2. α1α2 + α1α3 + α1α4 + α2α3 + α2α4 + α3α4 = b = 0
3. α1α2α3 + α1α2α4 + α1α3α4 + α2α3α4 = -c = 0
4. α1α2α3α4 = d = 2
so, the sum of roots is -2, the sum of pairwise products is 0, the sum of triple products is 0, and the product of all roots is 2.
the problem is asking for the set {α1α2 + α3α4, α1α3 + α2α4, α1α4 + α2α3}.
each of these terms is a sum of two products of pairs of roots.
since the original sum of all pairwise products is 0, maybe these three terms are related to each other?
let me think.
let's denote s1 = α1α2 + α3α4, s2 = α1α3 + α2α4, s3 = α1α4 + α2α3.
then, the set we need is {s1, s2, s3}.
note that s1 + s2 + s3 = (α1α2 + α3α4) + (α1α3 + α2α4) + (α1α4 + α2α3) = α1α2 + α1α3 + α1α4 + α2α3 + α2α4 + α3α4 = 0, from vieta's formula.
so the sum of these three terms is 0.
therefore, if we can find two of them, the third is determined.
but the problem is to find all three.
alternatively, perhaps we can find the polynomial equation with roots s1, s2, s3?
since the roots are symmetric, maybe these s's are roots of a cubic equation.
to form the cubic equation, we need the sums s1 + s2 + s3, which is 0, the sum of products s1s2 + s1s3 + s2s3, and the product s1s2s3.
we already know the sum is 0.
let's compute the sum of the products of two at a time.
let's think in parallel.

1: the product s1s2, defined as (α1α2 + α3α4)(α1α3 + α2α4), is expanded to α1^2α2α3 + α1α2^2α4 + α1α3α4^2 + α2α3α4^2. this expression is recognized as the sum of terms corresponding to the product of two distinct roots multiplied by the squares of the other two roots.
</path>

2: the product s1s3 is (α1α2 + α3α4)(α1α4 + α2α3). expanding this product yields α1α2α1α4 + α1α2α2α3 + α3α4α1α4 + α3α4α2α3. this expression simplifies to α1²α2α4 + α1α2²α3 + α1α3α4² + α2α3²α4.

wait, actually, no.
wait, let's look at each s1s2, s1s3, s2s3:
from s1s2:
α12α2α3 + α1α22α4 + α1α32α4 + α2α3α42
from s1s3:
α12α2α4 + α1α22α3 + α1α3α42 + α2α32α4
from s2s3:
α12α3α4 + α1α22α4 + α1α32α4 + α23α4

wait, maybe this approach is getting too complicated.
maybe there's a smarter way.
alternatively, note that each of s1, s2, s3 can be considered as (sum of products of roots two at a time) minus the product of a specific pair.
for example, s1 = α1α2 + α3α4 = (α1α2 + α1α3 + α1α4 + α2α3 + α2α4 + α3α4) - (α1α3 + α1α4 + α2α3 + α2α4).
but since the total sum of pairwise products is 0, s1 = - (α1α3 + α1α4 + α2α3 + α2α4).
wait, but then s1 would be related to other sums.
hmm, but maybe not.
alternatively, perhaps express s1, s2, s3 in terms of elementary symmetric polynomials.
wait, the elementary symmetric polynomials here are:
e1 = α1 + α2 + α3 + α4 = -2
e2 = α1α2 + α1α3 + ... + α3α4 = 0
e3 = α1α2α3 + ... + α2α3α4 = 0
e4 = α1α2α3α4 = 2
we need to express each s1, s2, s3 in terms of these.
for example, s1 = α1α2 + α3α4.
but since e2 = 0, we have α1α2 + α1α3 + α1α4 + α2α3 + α2α4 + α3α4 = 0.
therefore, α1α2 + α3α4 = - (α1α3 + α1α4 + α2α3 + α2α4).
but α1α3 + α1α4 + α2α3 + α2α4 = (α1 + α2)(α3 + α4).
let me see:
let’s denote (α1 + α2)(α3 + α4) = α1α3 + α1α4 + α2α3 + α2α4.
therefore, s1 = - (α1 + α2)(α3 + α4).
similarly, maybe s2 = - (α1 + α3)(α2 + α4), and s3 = - (α1 + α4)(α2 + α3).
therefore, the set {s1, s2, s3} is equal to the set {- (α1 + α2)(α3 + α4), - (α1 + α3)(α2 + α4), - (α1 + α4)(α2 + α3)}.
therefore, if we can find the possible values of (α_i + α_j)(α_k + α_l) for distinct i, j, k, l, then the required set is the negatives of those.
alternatively, perhaps these products are related to the elementary symmetric polynomials.
let’s see.
let me denote s1 = α1 + α2, s2 = α1 + α3, s3 = α1 + α4, s4 = α2 + α3, s5 = α2 + α4, s6 = α3 + α4.
then, the s1, s2, s3 correspond to -s1*s2 something?
wait, maybe not.
wait, s1 = -(sum of products of roots taken two at a time excluding α1α2 and α3α4).
wait, actually, s1 is defined as α1α2 + α3α4.
but in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials, maybe we can write s1 + s2 + s3 = 0, which we already know.
but maybe we can compute (for example) the sum s1s2 + s1s3 + s2s3.
alternatively, note that (s1 + s2 + s3 + s4 + s5 + s6)^2 would be equal to something.
wait, actually, each of s1 to s6 is the sum of two roots.
since the sum of all roots is -2, if we take s1 = α1 + α2, then the sum of the other two roots is -2 - s1.
but maybe that can help.
wait, let's compute all pairwise sums.
if we denote s = α1 + α2 + α3 + α4 = -2.
then, if we take any two roots, say α1 and α2, then (α1 + α2) + (α3 + α4) = s = -2.
so if we let t1 = α1 + α2, then t2 = α3 + α4 = -2 - t1.
similarly, if we take other pairs, the same relationship holds.
therefore, perhaps the products (α1 + α2)(α3 + α4) can be written as t*(-2 - t), where t is α1 + α2.
so then, each term like (α1 + α2)(α3 + α4) is equal to -t^2 - 2t.
but if we can find the possible values of t, which is the sum of two roots.
let's think in parallel.

</path>
<conclusion>
the sum of the products (α_i + α_j)(α_k + α_l) for distinct i, j, k, l can be found using two distinct methods: one involving the sum of the products directly, and the other using the expansion of the square of the sum of all roots.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
but the sum of pairwise products is e2 = 0.
therefore:
4 = α12 + α22 + α32 + α42 + 2*0
so sum of squares of roots is 4.
let’s note that.
sum α12 + α22 + α32 + α42 = 4.
now, let's compute the sum of all (αi + αj)(αk + αl) where {i,j,k,l} is a permutation of 1,2,3,4.
how many such terms are there?
for four roots, the number of ways to partition them into two pairs is 3.
for example, the pairs can be (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23).
so there are three such terms, which correspond to our s1, s2, s3.
but we can compute the sum of these three terms, which is 0, as we saw earlier.
but maybe we can compute the sum of their squares, i.e., s12 + s22 + s32.
wait, but since s1 + s2 + s3 = 0, then (s1 + s2 + s3)^2 = 0 = s12 + s22 + s32 + 2(s1s2 + s1s3 + s2s3).
therefore, 0 = s12 + s22 + s32 + 2(s1s2 + s1s3 + s2s3).
but we need to find s1s2 + s1s3 + s2s3.
wait, maybe another approach.
let’s note that each of s1, s2, s3 is equal to (αi + αj)(αk + αl) = αiαk + αiαl + αjαk + αjαl.
but since the sum of all pairwise products is 0, then each s1, s2, s3 must be equal to the negative of the remaining pairwise products.
wait, maybe not sure.
alternatively, note that s1 = α1α2 + α3α4.
let’s compute s12:
s12 = (α1α2 + α3α4)^2 = α12α22 + α32α42 + 2α1α2α3α4.
similarly for s22 and s32.
therefore, s12 + s22 + s32 = (α12α22 + α32α42 + 2α1α2α3α4) + (α12α32 + α22α42 + 2α1α2α3α4) + (α12α42 + α22α32 + 2α1α2α3α4)
but since each s1, s2, s3 contributes two terms for the product α1α2α3α4.
since the product of all roots is 2, so α1α2α3α4 = 2.
therefore, each 2α1α2α3α4 = 2*2 = 4.
since there are three such terms, the total for those is 3*4 = 12.
then, the sum s12 + s22 + s32 = (sum of the squares terms) + 12.
now, compute the sum of squares terms:
α12α22 + α32α42 + α12α32 + α22α42 + α12α42 + α22α32.
hmm, how can we compute this?
let’s note that the product of all roots is 2, so α1α2α3α4 = 2.
therefore, (α1α2α3α4)^2 = 4.
so α12α22α32α42 = 4.
therefore, for example, α12α22 = 4 / (α32α42).
but not sure if that helps.
alternatively, we can use the squared sums.
wait, let's recall that (e2)^2 = (α1α2 + α1α3 + ... + α3α4)^2 = 0.
expanding that, we get:
sum_{i < j} αi2αj2 + 2 sum_{i < j < k < l} αiαjαkαl = 0.
but the sum of all pairwise products squared plus twice the sum over all distinct quadruplets.
but in our case, the sum of pairwise products squared is e22, which is 0.
but the sum over the quadruplet products, which is the sum over all αiαjαkαl for distinct i,j,k,l.
but each of these products is equal to (α1α2α3α4) * (1/(αm)) where m is the excluded root.
wait, not sure.
alternatively, since α1α2α3α4 = 2, so if we have a product missing one root, it's 2 / αm.
therefore, the sum sum_{i < j < k < l} αiαjαkαl would be equal to sum_{m=1 to 4} 2/αm.
but that is 2 sum_{m=1 to 4} 1/αm.
but let's denote that.
however, to compute this, perhaps we can use the original equation.
the equation is x4 + 2x3 + 0x2 + 0x + 2 = 0.
if we divide both sides by x, we get x3 + 2x2 + 0x + 2 = 0.
but reciprocal roots might help here.
if we let y = 1/x, then the equation in terms of y is:
(1/y)4 + 2(1/y)3 + 0(1/y)2 + 0(1/y) + 2 = 0
multiply both sides by y4:
1 + 2y + 0y2 + 0y3 + 2y4 = 0
or, 2y4 + 2y + 1 = 0.
therefore, the equation for the reciprocals of the roots is 2y4 + 2y + 1 = 0.
but the sum of the reciprocals of the roots is sum_{i=1}^4 1/αi, which by vieta on the reciprocal equation is - coefficient of y3 / coefficient of y4.
but in the equation 2y4 + 0y3 + 0y2 + 2y +1 = 0, the coefficient of y3 is 0, so sum 1/αi = 0.
therefore, sum_{i=1}^4 1/αi = 0.
therefore, sum_{i < j < k < l} αiαjαkαl = 2 sum_{m=1}^4 1/αm = 2 * 0 = 0.
therefore, going back to (e2)^2 = 0.
therefore, sum_{i < j} αi2αj2 + 2 * 0 = 0, so sum_{i < j} αi2αj2 = 0.
therefore, sum of squares of pairwise products of roots is 0.
but how does this help us?
wait, sum_{i < j} αi2αj2 = 0.
but in our previous computation, the sum s12 + s22 + s32 = (sum of terms like α12α22 + α32α42 + ...) + 12.
but how many terms are in the sum?
let's list all terms:
the six pairwise products are α1α2, α1α3, α1α4, α2α3, α2α4, α3α4.
when we square s1, s2, s3, each s squared gives two of these products squared and cross terms.
wait, but maybe a better way is to note that:
we have three terms s12, s22, s32.
each s1 is a sum of two terms, so s12 has two squared terms and a cross term.
but when we sum over all s12 + s22 + s32, the cross terms will be all the mixed products.
wait, let's do it manually.
given s1 = α1α2 + α3α4, s2 = α1α3 + α2α4, s3 = α1α4 + α2α3.
compute s12 + s22 + s32:
= (α12α22 + α32α42 + 2α1α2α3α4) + (α12α32 + α22α42 + 2α1α3α2α4) + (α12α42 + α22α32 + 2α1α4α2α3)
simplify:
= (α12α22 + α12α32 + α12α42 + α22α32 + α22α42 + α32α42) + 2(α1α2α3α4 + α1α2α3α4 + α1α2α3α4)
but note that in the cross terms, each term 2α1α2α3α4 appears three times, since there are three s's.
therefore, the cross terms sum to 6α1α2α3α4.
but since α1α2α3α4 = 2, this is 6*2=12.
the first part is the sum of all possible squares of pairwise products.
earlier, we found that the sum of (α1α2)^2 + (α1α3)^2 + ... + (α3α4)^2 = 0.
wait, but that conflicts with the idea that sum of squares is zero only if each term is zero, but the roots are complex.
but since the equation is x4 + 2x3 + 2 = 0, which has complex roots, but products of complex roots can result in complex numbers.
however, since the polynomial has real coefficients, the roots come in conjugate pairs.
suppose roots are a, b, c, d which can be two pairs of complex conjugates or split into real and complex.
but 4th degree equation with real coefficients: either four real roots (possibly) but in this case, the polynomial is x4 + 2x3 + 2.
let's check for real roots.
let f(x) = x4 + 2x3 + 2.
f'(x) = 4x3 +6x2 = 4x2(x + 1.5).
critical points at x=0 and x=-1.5.
evaluate f(0) = 2, f(-1.5) = (1.5)^4 + 2*(-1.5)^3 +2 = 5.0625 + 2*(-3.375) +2 = 5.0625 -6.75 + 2 = 0.3125.
so the function has local maximum at x=-1.5 of 0.3125 and local minimum at x=0 of 2.
as x approaches -infty, f(x) approaches +infty, and as x approaches +infty, f(x) also approaches +infty.
therefore, the function crosses the x-axis once between -infty and -1.5, then has a local maximum of 0.3125 (above the x-axis), then decreases to a local minimum of 2 at x=0 (above x-axis), then increases to infinity.
therefore, only one real root between -infty and -1.5, and three complex roots (since complex roots come in pairs, it's one real root and three complex roots, but complex roots of a polynomial with real coefficients come in conjugate pairs, so actually, two complex conjugate pairs.
wait, maybe the user wrote the problem with four distinct roots, but according to the polynomial, perhaps it has one real root and three complex roots, but complex roots can't necessarily form four distinct roots?
wait, but the problem states "the four distinct roots".
hmm, maybe i made an error.
wait, maybe the polynomial is x4 +2x3 + 2.
let me check if perhaps descartes' rule of signs can tell us.
for f(x), there is one sign change, so one positive real root.
but wait, f(0)=2, and as x approaches infinity, it's positive, but derivative shows it's increasing after x=0.
wait, maybe my earlier analysis was wrong.
wait, derivative f'(x)=4x3 +6x2= x2(4x +6).
critical points at x=0 and x=-6/4= -1.5.
at x=-1.5, f(-1.5)= (-1.5)^4 + 2*(-1.5)^3 +2= 5.0625 +2*(-3.375) ) +2=5.0625 -6.75 +2=0.3125, as before.
at x=0, f(0)=2.
so function decreases from x=-1.5 to x=0, where it reaches 2, then increases.
so the function approaches infinity as x approaches infinity and as x approaches -infinity.
but since there is a local minimum at x=0 with f(0)=2, which is above the x-axis, and local maximum at x=-1.5 with f(-1.5)=0.3125, also above the x-axis.
therefore, the function only crosses the x-axis once between -infty and -1.5, since it goes from infinity to 0.3125.
so only one real root, and the other three roots must be complex.
but the problem states "the four distinct roots", but according to this analysis, three of the roots are complex.
so perhaps they are two pairs of complex conjugate roots?
wait, complex roots come in conjugate pairs for polynomials with real coefficients.
so if there is one real root, then the other three roots must be a pair of complex conjugates and another real root.
but the problem states four distinct roots.
wait, maybe the real root is distinct and the other three roots are a pair of complex conjugates and another single complex number, but that would violate the conjugate root theorem.
therefore, unless the polynomial is not set up with real coefficients, but it is.
therefore, contradiction.
therefore, perhaps my analysis is wrong.
wait, maybe i made a mistake.
let me check again.
the polynomial is x4 + 2x3 + 2.
let me check f(-2)= (-2)^4 +2*(-2)^3 +2=16 + 2*(-8) +2=16 -16 +2=2.
so at x=-2, f(-2)=2.
so between x=-infty and x=-1.5, the function decreases from infinity to 0.3125.
then between x=-1.5 and x=0, it decreases to 2, then between x=0 and x= infinity, it increases from 2 to infinity.
therefore, since at x=-2, f(-2)=2, which is above the x-axis, and at x=-3, f(-3)= (-3)^4 + 2*(-3)^3 +2=81 -54 +2=29.
so still above.
wait, so when does it cross the x-axis?
wait, seems like my earlier conclusion is wrong.
wait, as x approaches -infty, the term x^4 dominates and goes to +infty.
as x approaches -infty, x^4 is very large positive, 2x^3 is also very large positive (since x^3 is negative, but multiplied by 2, but x^4 term dominates).
wait, no.
wait, x^4 term dominates as x approaches -infty, so the function goes to +infty.
at x=-1.5, the function is 0.3125.
so between x=-infty and x=-1.5, the function decreases from +infty to 0.3125, so it must cross the x-axis once in that interval.
wait, but if at x=-2, f(-2)=2, which is higher.
wait, wait, perhaps my calculus is wrong.
wait, f(x)=x4 +2x3 +2.
let's compute derivative f'(x)=4x3 +6x2=x2(4x +6).
so critical points at x=0 and x=-6/4= -1.5.
at x=-1.5, second derivative f''(x)=12x2 + 12x.
at x=-1.5, f''(-1.5)=12*(-1.5)^2 +12*(-1.5)=12*2.25 -18=27 -18=9>0, so it's a local minimum.
wait, but earlier, i thought x=-1.5 was a local maximum.
wait, no.
wait, first derivative test.
to the left of x=-1.5, let's test x=-2: f'(-2)= (-2)^2*(4*(-2) +6)=4*(-8+6)=4*(-2)=-8 <0.
between x=-1.5 and x=0, f'(x) is x2(4x +6), so 4x +6 is positive because x > -1.5.
so 4x +6 >0, and x2 >=0, so f'(x) >=0, so function is increasing from x=-1.5 to x=0.
therefore, at x=-1.5, since the function is decreasing before and increasing after, it's a local minimum.
so f(-1.5)=0.3125 is a local minimum.
then at x=0, which was f(0)=2, and since after x=0, derivative f'(0)=0 (since x=0 is a critical point), but for x>0, 4x +6>0, so f'(x)=x2(4x +6)>0 for x>0, so function is increasing for x>0.
therefore, the function decreases from -infty to x=-1.5 (local minimum 0.3125), then increases to x=0 (f(0)=2), then continues increasing for x>0.
therefore, the function crosses the x-axis only once, between -infty and x=-1.5.
therefore, only one real root, and the other three roots are complex.
but the problem states four distinct roots.
but three of them would have to be complex.
wait, but complex roots come in pairs.
so if there is one real root, there must be another real root, unless the remaining three roots form a complex conjugate pair and a single root, which is not possible.
wait, unless the three roots are a triple root, but the problem states four distinct roots.
therefore, this suggests that maybe all roots are real, but my analysis shows only one real root.
therefore, contradiction.
therefore, perhaps my analysis is incorrect.
wait, maybe the polynomial was written differently.
wait, user wrote x4 +2x3 +2=0.
yes, that's the polynomial.
wait, maybe my mistake is in the derivative.
wait, f(x)=x4 +2x3 +2.
then f'(x)=4x3 +6x2.
yes.
so critical points are at 4x3 +6x3=0 → 10x3=0 → x=0.
wait, wait, 4x3 +6x2=0 → x2(4x +6)=0 → x=0 or x=-6/4=-1.5.
so critical points at x=-1.5 and x=0.
wait, then as before, but my earlier conclusion was that there is one real root, but graphs suggest only one real root.
however, the problem states four distinct roots.
therefore, either the problem is incorrect, or my analysis is wrong.
alternatively, maybe the polynomial does have four real roots but i miscalculated.
wait, let's test some values.
let's compute f(-2)=16 + 16 + 2=34.
f(-1.5)=5.0625 + 2*(-3.375) +2=5.0625 -6.75 +2=0.3125.
f(-1)=1 + (-2) +2=1.
f(0)=2.
so between x=-2 and x=-1.5, function goes from 34 to 0.3125.
then at x=-1, it's 1, then at x=0, 2.
so still, only crossing once at x < -1.5.
wait, so maybe there's only one real root.
then the other three roots are complex.
but the problem says four distinct roots.
hmmm.
alternatively, maybe the problem is misstated, or perhaps they are considering multiple roots but the polynomial is square-free.
let's check if the polynomial is separable.
compute gcd(f, f').
f is x4 +2x3 +2.
f' is 4x3 +6x2 = x2(4x +6).
the polynomial x4 +2x3 +2 is primitive ( coefficients have gcd 1).
let's think in parallel.

1: the value of f(-3/2) is calculated as (-3/2)^4 + 2(-3/2)^3 + 2, which equals 5.0625 - 13.5 + 2, resulting in -6.4375. the value of f(-2) is determined to be 34.

2: the evaluation of f(-1) yields 1, and the evaluation of f(0) yields 2.

the evaluations of f(x) at x = -3/2, -2, -1, and 0 yield the respective results -6.4375, 34, 1, and 2.

so there's a sign change between x=-3/2 and x=-1, where f(-3/2)=-6.4375 and f(-1)=1.
therefore, there is at
