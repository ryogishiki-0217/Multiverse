<Think>
Okay, so I need to find the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x - 7}{\sqrt{x^2 - 5x + 6}} \).
The domain is all the x-values where the function is defined, right?

So, the denominator is \( \sqrt{x^2 - 5x + 6} \).
First, the expression inside the square root must be non-negative because you can't take the square root of a negative number in real-valued functions.
But also, since the entire square root term is in the denominator, it can't be zero either because division by zero is undefined.
So two conditions:
1. \( x^2 - 5x + 6 > 0 \) (strictly greater because denominator can't be zero)

2: The expression under the square root, \( x^2 - 5x + 6 \), must be positive because it is under a square root in the denominator. A square root is defined for non-negative numbers, but since it is in the denominator, the expression must be strictly positive.

<Conclusion>
The function is defined when the denominator is not zero and the expression under the square root is positive.
</Conclusion>

So, the denominator is \( \sqrt{x^2 - 5x + 6} \).
First, the expression inside the square root must be non-negative because you can't take the square root of a negative number in real-valued functions.
But also, since the entire square root term is in the denominator, it can't be zero either because division by zero is undefined.
So two conditions:
1. \( x^2 - 5x + 6 > 0 \) (strictly greater because denominator can't be zero)

solve the following math problem: what is the domain of the real-valued function $f(x)=\frac{2x-7}{\sqrt{x^2-5x+6}}$?
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
<think>
okay, so i need to find the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x - 7}{\sqrt{x^2 - 5x + 6}} \).
the domain is all the x-values where the function is defined, right?
