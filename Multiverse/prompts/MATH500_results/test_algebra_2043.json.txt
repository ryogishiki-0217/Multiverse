Okay, let's see. I need to find the domain of the function f(x) = (2x - 7) / sqrt(x2 - 5x + 6). The domain is the set of all x-values for which the function is defined, right? So, I need to figure out for which real numbers x this function makes sense.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: Determine the condition that the denominator must not be zero.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: Determine the condition that the expression inside the square root must be non-negative.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The denominator of the function is a square root, sqrt(x2 - 5x + 6). Since division by zero is undefined, the denominator must not be zero. Therefore, sqrt(x2 - 5x + 6) ≠ 0. This implies that the expression inside the square root, x2 - 5x + 6, must not be zero. The condition for the denominator is x2 - 5x + 6 ≠ 0.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The expression inside the square root, x2 - 5x + 6, must be positive. This is because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers, and the denominator cannot be zero.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The denominator must not be zero, which requires x2 - 5x + 6 ≠ 0. The expression inside the square root must be positive, which requires x2 - 5x + 6 > 0.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So, we need to solve x2 - 5x + 6 > 0. Hmm, let's factor that quadratic expression.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: Determine the roots of the quadratic equation x2 - 5x + 6 = 0.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: Determine the factored form of the quadratic expression x2 - 5x + 6.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The quadratic expression x2 - 5x + 6 is factored by identifying two numbers that multiply to 6 and add to -5, which are -2 and -3. This leads to the factored form (x - 2)(x - 3). Setting the factored form equal to zero, (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0, yields the roots x = 2 and x = 3.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The quadratic expression x2 - 5x + 6 is factored into (x - 2)(x - 3).
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The roots of the quadratic equation x2 - 5x + 6 = 0 are x = 2 and x = 3. The quadratic expression x2 - 5x + 6 factors into (x - 2)(x - 3).
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So, x2 -5x +6 >0 becomes (x -2)(x -3) >0. Now, I remember that for a quadratic like this, the sign of the product depends on the intervals determined by the roots. The roots are at x=2 and x=3, so these points divide the real line into three intervals: (-∞, 2), (2, 3), and (3, ∞). I need to test the sign of (x -2)(x -3) in each interval.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: Determine the sign of (x - 2)(x - 3) in the interval (-∞, 2).
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: Determine the sign of (x - 2)(x - 3) in the interval (2, 3).
</Outline>
<Outline>
3: Determine the sign of (x - 2)(x - 3) in the interval (3, ∞).
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The interval (-∞, 2) is considered, with x < 2. For x < 2, (x - 2) is negative (denoted as -), and (x - 3) is also negative (denoted as -). The product of two negative numbers is positive, so (x - 2)(x - 3) is positive in this interval.
</Path>
<Path>
2: A test point x=2.5 is chosen for the interval (2, 3). The sign of (x - 2) is positive because 2.5 - 2 = 0.5 > 0. The sign of (x - 3) is negative because 2.5 - 3 = -0.5 < 0. The product of a positive and a negative value is negative. Therefore, (x - 2)(x - 3) is negative in the interval (2, 3).
</Path>
<Path>
3: For the interval (3, ∞), a test point x = 4 is chosen. The expression (4 - 2)(4 - 3) equals (2)(1) = 2, which is positive. The expression (x - 2)(x - 3) is positive for x in (3, ∞).
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The expression (x - 2)(x - 3) is positive in the interval (-∞, 2). It is negative in the interval (2, 3). It is positive in the interval (3, ∞).
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So, the quadratic expression is positive when x <2 or x >3. Therefore, the inequality x2 -5x +6 >0 is satisfied when x is in (-∞, 2) U (3, ∞). Therefore, the expression under the square root is positive in these intervals, so the square root is defined there. However, we also need to ensure that the denominator is not zero, but since we're requiring the expression under the square root to be strictly positive, that automatically takes care of the denominator not being zero, because sqrt(something positive) is non-zero. So, the domain of the function is where the expression under the square root is positive, which is x in (-∞, 2) U (3, ∞). But just to double-check, let's think about the denominator again. The denominator is sqrt(x2 -5x +6). Since square root is always non-negative, and since we cannot divide by zero, we must have sqrt(x2 -5x +6) ≠ 0. That happens when x2 -5x +6 ≠0. But x2 -5x +6 is zero at x=2 and x=3, but as we have already excluded these points when we required the expression under the square root to be positive (since at x=2 and x=3, the expression under the square root is zero, which is not positive). So by requiring the expression under the square root to be positive, we've already excluded the points where the denominator would be zero. Therefore, the domain is indeed x ∈ (-∞, 2) U (3, ∞). Let me check with specific values. Let's test x=1, which is in (-∞, 2). Then x2 -5x +6 = 1 -5 +6 = 2 >0. Good. x=2.5, which is in (2,3). Then x2 -5x +6 = 6.25 -12.5 +6 = -0.25 <0. So square root is undefined here. And x=4, which is in (3, ∞). Then x2 -5x +6 = 16 -20 +6 = 2 >0. Perfect. So, the function is defined for x <2 and x >3. Therefore, the domain is all real numbers except when x is between 2 and 3, inclusive. So in interval notation, (-∞, 2) U (3, ∞). Just to confirm, let's check if there's any other restrictions. The numerator is just 2x -7; since it's a linear function, it's defined everywhere, so no additional restrictions from the numerator. The only restrictions come from the denominator. Therefore, I'm confident with the domain being (-∞, 2) U (3, ∞). So in interval notation, we write: (-∞, 2) U (3, ∞). The final answer is \boxed{(-\infty, 2) \cup (3, \infty)}

Answer: To find the domain of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x - 7}{\sqrt{x^2 - 5x + 6}} \), we need to ensure that the expression inside the square root is positive (since the square root of a negative number is undefined in real numbers and the denominator cannot be zero).

1. **Factor the quadratic expression inside the square root:**
   \[
   x^2 - 5x + 6 = (x - 2)(x - 3)
   \]
   So, the inequality becomes:
   \[
   (x - 2)(x - 3) > 0
   \]

2. **Determine the intervals where the inequality holds:**
   - The roots of the equation \((x - 2)(x - 3) = 0\) are \(x = 2\) and \(x = 3\).
   - These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, 2)\), \((2, 3)\), and \((3, \infty)\).

3. **Test the sign of \((x - 2)(x - 3)\) in each interval:**
   - For \(x \in (-\infty, 2)\), choose \(x = 1\):
     \[
     (1 - 2)(1 - 3) = (-1)(-2) = 2 > 0
     \]
   - For \(x \in (2, 3)\), choose \(x = 2.5\):
     \[
     (2.5 - 2)(2.5 - 3) = (0.5)(-0.5) = -0.25 < 0
     \]
   - For \(x \in (3, \infty)\), choose \(x = 4\):
     \[
     (4 - 2)(4 - 3) = (2)(1) = 2 > 0
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The expression \((x - 2)(x - 3)\) is positive in the intervals \((-\infty, 2)\) and \((3, \infty)\).

Therefore, the domain of the function \( f(x) \) is all real numbers except those in the interval \([2, 3]\). In interval notation, the domain is:
\[
\boxed{(-\infty, 2) \cup (3, \infty)}
\]
