Okay, let me try to solve this equation: \(2^3 \cdot 3^x = 72\).
Hmm, I need to find the value of \(x\).
Let's see.
First, let's simplify whatever we can.
I know that \(2^3\) is 8, so the left side becomes \(8 \cdot 3^x\).
So the equation is \(8 \cdot 3^x = 72\).
Then, I can divide both sides by 8 to isolate the \(3^x\).
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: The result of dividing the left side of the equation \(8 \cdot 3^x = 72\) by 8.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: The result of dividing the right side of the equation \(8 \cdot 3^x = 72\) by 8.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: Dividing the left side of the equation \(8 \cdot 3^x = 72\) by 8 yields \(3^x\).
</Path>
<Path>
2: Dividing the right side of the equation \(8 \cdot 3^x = 72\) by 8 yields 9.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The division operation results in the equation \(3^x = 9\).
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So now we have \(3^x = 9\).
Hmm, okay.
Now, I need to solve for \(x\) where 3 raised to the power of \(x\) equals 9.
Since 9 is a power of 3, this should be straightforward.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: The expression of 9 as a power of 3.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: The value of x obtained by equating the exponents of the same base in the equation \(3^x = 3^2\).
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The number 9 can be expressed as \(3^2\), which means the equation \(3^x = 9\) can be rewritten as \(3^x = 3^2\).
</Path>
<Path>
2: Equating the exponents of the common base 3 in the equation \(3^x = 3^2\) yields \(x = 2\).
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The expression of 9 as \(3^2\) allows the equation \(3^x = 9\) to be rewritten as \(3^x = 3^2\), from which the solution \(x = 2\) is derived.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Wait, that seems simple.
Let me verify if that's correct.

Yep, that works.
So x is 2.
But maybe there's another way to check?

The solution x=2 is confirmed by substitution into the original equation and by the prime factorization of 72.

Alternatively, if the equation was more complex and the bases weren't the same, maybe I could take the logarithm of both sides.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: The logarithmic form of the equation \(3^x = 9\).
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: The calculation of the logarithm \(\log_3(9)\).

</Goal>
<Path>
1: The equation \(3^x = 9\) can be expressed in logarithmic form as \(x = \log_3(9)\).
</Path>
<Path>
2: The calculation \(\log_3(9)\) yields 2, because \(3^2 = 9\).
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The logarithmic equation \(x = \log_3(9)\) holds, and its solution is 2.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So again, x=2.
All these methods confirm the answer is 2.
Therefore, I can conclude that x equals 2.
But wait, just to make sure, let me consider if there's any other possible solutions.
Since the exponential function is one-to-one, meaning each output corresponds to exactly one input, so x=2 is the only solution.
Also, since 3^x is always positive and increasing, so the equation 3^x = 9 has only one real solution.
Therefore, definitely, x=2.
the final answer is \boxed{2}
</Think>

Answer: To solve the equation \(2^3 \cdot 3^x = 72\), we start by simplifying the left side. 

First, calculate \(2^3\):
\[2^3 = 8\]
So the equation becomes:
\[8 \cdot 3^x = 72\]

Next, we isolate \(3^x\) by dividing both sides by 8:
\[3^x = \frac{72}{8}\]
\[3^x = 9\]

We recognize that 9 can be written as a power of 3:
\[3^x = 3^2\]

Since the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents:
\[x = 2\]

To verify, we substitute \(x = 2\) back into the original equation:
\[2^3 \cdot 3^2 = 8 \cdot 9 = 72\]

The solution is confirmed to be correct. Therefore, the value of \(x\) is \(\boxed{2}\).
