Okay, so I need to solve for x in the equation 2^3 * 3^x = 72.
Hmm, let me think.
Alright, first, 2^3 is 8, right?
So I can rewrite the equation as 8 * 3^x = 72.
Then, I want to isolate 3^x.
Let me divide both sides by 8.
That gives me 3^x = 72 / 8.
Let me compute 72 divided by 8.
72 divided by 8 is 9.
So, 3^x = 9.
Now, I need to figure out what power of 3 gives 9.
Since 3^2 is 9, x should be 2.
But let me confirm that.
Let's think in parallel.

1: The left-hand side (LHS) of the original equation is evaluated using the derived value x=2.

1: The left-hand side (LHS) of the original equation, 2^3 * 3^x, is evaluated using the derived value x=2. This results in 2^3 * 3^2, which simplifies to 8 * 9, yielding a value of 72.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The right-hand side of the original equation is 72.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The evaluation of the left-hand side (LHS) of the original equation with x=2 results in 72, which matches the stated right-hand side (RHS) value of 72.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Wait, that works.
So x is 2.
But maybe there's another way to approach this problem, like using logarithms?
Let's see.
Alternatively, take the natural logarithm of both sides: ln(2^3 * 3^x) = ln(72).
Using logarithm properties, that would be ln(2^3) + ln(3^x) = ln(72), which simplifies to 3 ln2 + x ln3 = ln72.
Then, solving for x: x ln3 = ln72 - 3 ln2
Then, x = (ln72 - 3 ln2) / ln3
Let me compute that.
First, ln72.
72 is 8*9, so ln(8*9) = ln8 + ln9 = 3ln2 + 2ln3.
So substituting back into x: x = (3 ln2 + 2 ln3 - 3 ln2) / ln3
Simplify numerator: 3 ln2 -3 ln2 cancels out, leaving 2 ln3.
So x = (2 ln3)/ln3 = 2.
So same answer.
That's good.
So regardless of the method, x equals 2.
Hmm, so even though using logarithms is a more general approach, in this case, it simplifies to the same answer.
I think both methods are valid.
The first method is probably more straightforward because the numbers are nice and manageable.
Let me just check if there's any other possible solutions.
Since 3^x is a one-to-one function, strictly increasing, so there should be only one solution.
So x=2 is the only solution.
Yes, that makes sense.
Therefore, the answer is x=2.
**Final Answer** 
the final answer is \boxed{2}

Answer: To solve the equation \(2^3 \cdot 3^x = 72\), we start by simplifying the left side. 

First, calculate \(2^3\):
\[2^3 = 8\]

This simplifies the equation to:
\[8 \cdot 3^x = 72\]

Next, isolate \(3^x\) by dividing both sides by 8:
\[3^x = \frac{72}{8}\]
\[3^x = 9\]

We recognize that 9 can be written as \(3^2\), so:
\[3^x = 3^2\]

Since the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents:
\[x = 2\]

To verify, substitute \(x = 2\) back into the original equation:
\[2^3 \cdot 3^2 = 8 \cdot 9 = 72\]

The solution is confirmed to be correct. Therefore, the value of \(x\) is \(\boxed{2}\).
