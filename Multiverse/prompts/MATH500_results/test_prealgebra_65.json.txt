Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step.
The question is: Let N be the units digit of the number 21420N.
Which nonzero value of N makes this number divisible by 6?
Hmm, so we need to find a nonzero digit N (so N can be from 1 to 9) such that when we place N as the units digit of 21420N, the entire number becomes divisible by 6.
First, let me recall that a number is divisible by 6 if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 3.
That's a key point here.
So, we need 21420N to satisfy two conditions: it must be divisible by 2 and by 3.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: Determine the divisibility by 2 of the number 21420N.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: Determine the divisibility by 3 of the number 21420N.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: Divisibility by 2 requires the number's units digit to be even. The units digit of 21420N is N, necessitating N to be an even digit. Since N is a non-zero digit, the possible values for N are 2, 4, 6, or 8.
</Path>
<Path>
2: Divisibility by 3 is assessed by the sum of the number's digits. The sum of the digits of 21420N is calculated as 2 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 0 + N, which equals 9 + N. For the number 21420N to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits, 9 + N, must also be divisible by 3. Given that 9 is itself divisible by 3, it follows that N must also be divisible by 3. Therefore, the digit N must be a multiple of 3.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
Divisibility by 2 necessitates that N is an even digit (2, 4, 6, or 8). Divisibility by 3 necessitates that N is a digit divisible by 3.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
But since the number must be divisible by both 2 and 3, N must satisfy both conditions.
Therefore, N needs to be an even digit that's also a multiple of 3.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: Determine the intersection of even non-zero digits (2, 4, 6, 8) and digits divisible by 3.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: Evaluate N=6 as a potential solution by checking the divisibility conditions.
</Outline>
<Outline>
3: Evaluate N=2, N=4, N=8 as potential solutions by checking the divisibility conditions.

<Path>
1: The digits satisfying both conditions of being even and a multiple of 3 are identified. The set of even digits is {2, 4, 6, 8}. The set of digits divisible by 3 is {3, 6, 9}. The intersection of these sets, representing digits that are both even and divisible by 3, is {6}.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The digit 6 is a multiple of both 2 and 3, making it a candidate. The number 214206 is formed with N=6. The sum of its digits is 2+1+4+2+0+6 = 15, which is divisible by 3. The units digit 6 is even, so 214206 is divisible by 2. The number 214206 meets both divisibility criteria. The question specifies "which nonzero value of N", suggesting a unique solution. The possibility of other valid N values is considered.
</Path>
<Path>
3: The remaining candidate values for N are 2, 4, and 8. These values are to be tested against the divisibility conditions. The sum of the digits of the number 21420N is 9 + N. For N=2, the sum is 9 + 2| = 11. Since 11 is not divisible by 3, the number 214202 is not divisible by 3, and consequently, not divisible by 6. For N=4, the sum of the digits is 9 + 4 = 13. As 13 is not divisible by 3, the number 214204 is not divisible by 3, and thus not divisible by 6. For N=8, the sum of the digits is 9 + 8 = 17. Since 17 is not divisible by 3, the number 214208 is not divisible by 3, and therefore not divisible by 6.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The analysis shows that only N=6 satisfies the dual conditions of being an even digit and a multiple of 3. Testing this value confirms its validity. Other even digits (2, 4, 8) do not satisfy the divisibility by 3 condition because the sum of digits (9+N) is not divisible by 3 for these values.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Therefore, the only nonzero value of N that makes 21420N divisible by 6 is 6.
Let's think in parallel.

1: The number 214206 is verified for divisibility by 2. Its units digit is 6, which is even, satisfying the divisibility by 2 condition. The sum of its digits, 2+1+4+2+0+6, is 15. Since 15 is divisible by 3, the number 214206 satisfies the divisibility by 3 condition.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The reasoning is re-confirmed. The sum of the digits (2+1+4+2+0+N) equals 9+N. For 9+N to be divisible by 3, N must be divisible by 3. N must also be an even digit to satisfy divisibility by 2. The even digits are 2, 4, 6, and 8. The digits divisible by 3 are 3, 6, and 9. The only digit common to both sets is 6. N=6 is the only viable option. The sum 9+6=15 is divisible by 3, confirming the number is divisible by 3. The number 214206 ends with 6, making it divisible by 2. The number 214206 meets the criteria for divisibility by 6.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The number 214206 is confirmed to be divisible by both 2 and 3. The reasoning process, which identifies 6 as the only digit common to even numbers and multiples of 3, is validated as correct, confirming N=6 as the unique solution.

Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the nonzero value of \( N \) such that the number \( 21420N \) is divisible by 6. A number is divisible by 6 if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 3.

1. **Divisibility by 2**: The units digit \( N \) must be even. Therefore, \( N \) can be 2, 4, 6, or 8.
2. **Divisibility by 3**: The sum of the digits of the number must be divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of \( 21420N \) is \( 2 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 0 + N = 9 + N \). Since 9 is already divisible by 3, \( N \) must also be divisible by 3.

Combining both conditions, \( N \) must be an even digit that is also a multiple of 3. The only digit satisfying both conditions is 6. 

Verification:
- For \( N = 6 \), the number is \( 214206 \).
- Check divisibility by 2: The units digit is 6 (even) → divisible by 2.
- Check divisibility by 3: Sum of digits \( 2 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 0 + 6 = 15 \), which is divisible by 3 → divisible by 3.

Thus, the nonzero value of \( N \) that makes \( 21420N \) divisible by 6 is \(\boxed{6}\).

answer: to solve the problem, we need to determine the nonzero value of \( n \) such that the number \( 21420n \) is divisible by 6. a number is divisible by 6 if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 3.

1. **divisibility by 2**: the units digit \( n \) must be even. therefore, \( n \) can be 2, 4, 6, or 8.
2. **divisibility by 3**: the sum of the digits of the number must be divisible by 3. the sum of the digits of \( 21420n \) is \( 2 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 0 + n = 9 + n \). since 9 is already divisible by 3, \( n \) must also be divisible by 3.

combining both conditions, \( n \) must be an even digit that is also a multiple of 3. the only digit satisfying both conditions is 6. 

verification:
- for \( n = 6 \), the number is \( 214206 \).
- check divisibility by 2: the units digit is 6 (even) → divisible by 2.
- check divisibility by 3: sum of digits \( 2 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 0 + 6 = 15 \), which is divisible by 3 → divisible by 3.

thus, the nonzero value of \( n \) that makes \( 21420n \) divisible by 6 is \(\boxed{6}\)
