Okay, so I have this problem where I need to compute the cross product of (2b - a) and (3c + a). The given information includes the cross products of vectors a, b, and c. Specifically, a × b, a × c, and b × c are provided. Hmm, let me write them down:
a × b = [6, -7, 3]^T,
a × c = [4, 7, 2]^T,
b × c = [1, -7, 18]^T.
I need to find (2b - a) × (3c + a).
First, I remember that the cross product is linear in each vector, meaning it distributes over addition. So maybe I can expand this expression using the distributive property.
Let me try that:
(2b - a) × (3c + a) = 2b × 3c + 2b × a - a × 3c - a × a.
Let's compute each term separately.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: Determination of the value of the term 2b × 3c.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: Determination of the value of the term 2b × a.
</Outline>
<Outline>
3: Determination of the value of the term -a × 3c.
</Outline>
<Outline>
4: Determination of the value of the term -a × a.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The term 2b × 3c is evaluated by factoring out the scalars, resulting in 2*3*(b × c) = 6(b × c). Substituting the given value for b × c, this becomes 6*[1, -7, 18]^T. The computation of 6*[1, -7, 18]^T yields the vector [6, -42, 108]^T.
The value of the term 2b × 3c is therefore [6, -42, 108]^T.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The term 2b × a is equivalent to 2(b × a).
The cross product is antisymmetric, so b × a equals -a × b.
Therefore, 2(b × a) equals -2(a × b).
</Path>
<Path>
3: The term -a × 3c is simplified by factoring out the scalar 3, resulting in -3(a × c). The given value for a × c is [4, 7, 2], so the term becomes -3
<Path>
4: The term -a × a is simplified using the property that the cross product of any vector with itself is the zero vector. Therefore, -a × a] is [0, 0, 0], and the entire term is [0, 0, 0].
</Path>
<Path>
4: The cross product of a vector with itself is zero, so -a × a equals -0, which is 0.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The individual terms were computed as: 2b × 3c = [6, -42, 108], 2b × a = -2(a × b), -a × 3c = -3(a × c), and -a × a = [0, 0, 0].
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Now, substituting the given values:
First term: 6*[1, -7, 18]^T = [6, -42, 108].
Second term: -2(a × b) = -2*[6, -7, 3]^T = [-12, 14, -6].
Third term: -3(a × c) = -3*[4, 7, 2]^T = [-12, -21, -6].
Fourth term: [0, 0, 0].
So now, adding all these terms together:
First term: [6, -42, 108]
Second term: [-12, 14, -6]
Third term: [-12, -21, -6]
Fourth term: [0, 0, 0]
Let me add them component-wise.
Starting with the x-component:
6 + (-12) + (-12) + 0 = 6 - 12 -12 = -18.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: Determination of the y-component of the sum.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: Determination of the z-component of the sum.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The y-component is calculated by summing -42, 14, and -21. The intermediate sum of -42 and 14 is -28, and adding -21 yields a total y-component of -49.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The z-components, 108, -6, -6, and 0, are summed to yield 108 - 6 - 6 = 96.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The y-component of the sum is -49, and the z-component is 96.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So the resulting vector is [-18, -49, 96].
Wait, let me verify that:
First component: 6 (from first term) -12 (second term) -12 (third term) = 6 -24 = -18. Correct.
Second component: -42 (first term) +14 (second) -21 (third) = -42 +14 = -28; -28 -21 = -49. Correct.
Third component: 108 (first) -6 (second) -6 (third) = 108 -12 = 96. Correct.
So the final vector is [-18, -49, 96].
But let me check once more because these numbers seem a bit large. But if I compute each term correctly and add them up, seems okay.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: Verification of the calculation for the first term, 6(b × c).
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: Verification of the calculation for the second term, -2(a × b).
</Outline>
<Outline>
3: Verification of the calculation for the third term, -3(a × c).
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The first term is 6 multiplied by the vector [1, -7, 18], resulting in the vector [6, -42, 108].
</Path>
<Path>
2: The second term, -2(a × b), is re-evaluated. The value of a × b is [6, -7, 3]. Multiplying by -2 yields [-12, 14, -6], confirming the previous calculation.
</Path>
<Path>
3: The third term, -3(a × c), is confirmed by calculating -3 * [4, 7, 2], which equals [-12, -21, -6]. The correctness of this result is verified.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The calculations for the individual terms are confirmed as correct: the first term is [6, -42, 108], the second term is [-12, 14, -6], and the third term is [-12, -21, -6].
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Adding all terms:
Term1 components: 6, -42, 108
Term2: -12, 14, -6
Term3: -12, -21, -6
Term4: 0, 0, 0
Adding x-components: 6 -12 -12 +0 = -18
y-components: -42 +14 -21 +0 = -49
z-components: 108 -6 -6 +0 = 96
So yes, the result is [-18, -49, 96].
Wait, but the problem is asking to solve for something? Wait, no, the problem is just to compute (2b -a) × (3c +a) given the three cross products. And we did that. So the answer is that vector.
But the answer should be written in the form the problem expects. Let me check the original problem again.
Oh, okay, it says "Solve the following math problem", and then presents the vectors. So the problem is to compute that cross product, and the given cross products are data to use. So our calculation is correct?
Wait, but in our calculation, we used the given cross products directly. We didn't have any other vectors given, just the three cross products. So using linearity is the correct approach here. So I believe that's correct.
Just to double-check, let me see if there is another approach.
Alternatively, perhaps express (2b -a) × (3c +a) in terms of the given cross products. Let me see.
But through expansion, which is what I did above. But maybe there's a smarter way. Let's see.
Wait, another thought: since we know a × b, a × c, and b × c, we could try to express (2b -a) × (3c +a) in terms of these known cross products. Let me try that.
First, (2b -a) × (3c +a). Let me distribute:
= 2b × 3c + 2b × a - a × 3c - a × a.
Which is the same as before. Then substituting 6(b × c), -2(a × b), -3(a × c), and zero. So same as above.
So no shortcut here. So the answer is indeed [-18, -49, 96].
But let's just check one more time. Suppose the answer is a vector with components -18, -49, 96.
But maybe the problem expects the answer in another form? No, cross products are vectors, so this is the answer.
Wait, but let me check for possible miscalculations:
First term: 6*(b × c) = 6*[1, -7, 18] = [6, -42, 108].
Second term: -2*(a × b) = -2*[6, -7, 3] = [-12, 14, -6].
Third term: -3*(a × c) = -3*[4, 7, 2] = [-12, -21, -6].
Adding all terms:
x-components: 6 + (-12) + (-12) = 6 - 12 -12 = -18.
y-components: -42 +14 + (-21) = -42 +14 = -28; -28 -21 = -49.
z-components: 108 + (-6) + (-6) = 108 -12 = 96.
Correct. So the final answer is [ -18, -49, 96 ].
But in the original problem, the vectors are written as column vectors. So maybe we need to write the answer as a column vector? The original cross products are written as column vectors too. So probably yes.
Let me check the problem again. Yes, the given cross products are written as column vectors, e.g., "begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}". So the answer should also be a column vector.
So in the box, it should be written as a column vector.
But wait, the question says "Solve the following math problem:" and then the problem. So perhaps they just want the components in a box, but following their syntax.
Wait, but the user instruction says to put the answer in a specific phrase. Let me check.
The user says: "Solve the following math problem: Let ... be three vectors such that a × b = ..., a × c = ..., b × c = .... Solve: (2b -a) × (3c +a)."
Then the user says "please show your reasoning process first, then provide the final answer in a fixed format: 'the final answer is ...' Replace ... with the actual answer. Ensure this exact phrase is included at the end of your response."
Therefore, I need to provide the answer as "the final answer is [-18, -49, 96]" but in the column vector form. Wait, but how is the answer formatted? Since the given vectors are in column vector notation (with begin{pmatrix} ... \end{pmatrix}), then probably the answer should also be in that form.
Wait, but the system here may not support LaTeX. Wait, no, the user's message has LaTeX delimiters. Wait, the original problem is written in LaTeX delimiters, but I'm typing in a text box. The final answer should be written in a way that, when the assistant sends it, it's enclosed in \boxed{} and in LaTeX. Wait, but the user said "Replace ... with the actual answer. Ensure this exact phrase is included at the end of your response."
Hmm. Wait, the original problem was presented as:
"Solve the following math problem: Let $\mathbf{a},$ $\mathbf{b},$ $\mathbf{c}$ be three vectors such that
\[\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}.\]
Solve: $(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})$."
So the answer should be in the form of a column vector within a pmatrix environment, enclosed in boxes. But since I'm writing in text, the user will format it properly. Wait, no, the user specified that I should write the answer in the response, replacing the ellipsis with the actual answer. Given the original problem uses LaTeX column vectors with pmatrix, so likely the answer should be written in the same way.
Therefore, the answer is:
\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}}
But let me confirm. The problem is from linear algebra, likely, and the answer is a vector, so column vector is appropriate. Thus, yes.
Therefore, after writing the reasoning, the final answer is boxed as above.
**Final Answer**
\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}}
</Think>

Answer: Given the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\), \(\mathbf{b}\), and \(\mathbf{c}\) with the cross products:
\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix},
\]
we need to find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\).

Using the distributive property of the cross product, we expand the expression:
\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}.
\]

Calculating each term separately:
1. \(2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix}\),
2. \(2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -2 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) = -2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}\),
3. \(-\mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} = -3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) = -3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}\),
4. \(-\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}\).

Adding these results component-wise:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 - 12 - 12 + 0 \\ -42 + 14 - 21 + 0 \\ 108 - 6 - 6 + 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}}
\]

okay, so i have this problem where i need to compute the cross product of (2b - a) and (3c + a). the given information includes the cross products of vectors a, b, and c. specifically, a × b, a × c, and b × c are provided. hmm, let me write them down:
a × b = [6, -7, 3]^t,
a × c = [4, 7, 2]^t,
b × c = [1, -7, 18]^t.
i need to find (2b - a) × (3c + a).
first, i remember that the cross product is linear in each vector, meaning it distributes over addition. so maybe i can expand this expression using the distributive property.
let me try that:
(2b - a) × (3c + a) = 2b × 3c + 2b × a - a × 3c - a × a.
let's compute each term separately.
let's think in parallel.

3: determination of the value of the term -a × 3c.
</outline>
<outline>
4: determination of the value of the term -a × a.
</outline>
</goal>
<path>
1: the term 2b × 3c is evaluated by factoring out the scalars, resulting in 2*3*(b × c) = 6(b × c). substituting the given value for b × c, this becomes 6*[1, -7, 18]^t. the computation of 6*[1, -7, 18]^t yields the vector [6, -42, 108]^t.
the value of the term 2b × 3c is therefore [6, -42, 108]^t.
</path>
<path>
2: the term 2b × a is equivalent to 2(b × a).
the cross product is antisymmetric, so b × a equals -a × b.
therefore, 2(b × a) equals -2(a × b).
</path>
<path>
3: the term -a × 3c is simplified by factoring out the scalar 3, resulting in -3(a × c). the given value for a × c is [4, 7, 2], so the term becomes -3
<path>
4: the term -a × a is simplified using the property that the cross product of any vector with itself is the zero vector. therefore, -a × a] is [0, 0, 0], and the entire term is [0, 0, 0].
</path>
<path>
4: the cross product of a vector with itself is zero, so -a × a equals -0, which is 0.
</path>
<conclusion>
the individual terms were computed as: 2b × 3c = [6, -42, 108], 2b × a = -2(a × b), -a × 3c = -3(a × c), and -a × a = [0, 0, 0].
</conclusion>
</parallel>
now, substituting the given values:
first term: 6*[1, -7, 18]^t = [6, -42, 108].
second term: -2(a × b) = -2*[6, -7, 3]^t = [-12, 14, -6].
third term: -3(a × c) = -3*[4, 7, 2]^t = [-12, -21, -6].
fourth term: [0, 0, 0].
so now, adding all these terms together:
first term: [6, -42, 108]
second term: [-12, 14, -6]
third term: [-12, -21, -6]
fourth term: [0, 0, 0]
let me add them component-wise.
starting with the x-component:
6 + (-12) + (-12) + 0 = 6 - 12 -12 = -18.
let's think in parallel.

2: determination of the z-component of the sum.

1: the y-component is calculated by summing -42, 14, and -21. the intermediate sum of -42 and 14 is -28, and adding -21 yields a total y-component of -49.
</path>
<path>
2: the z-components, 108, -6, -6, and 0, are summed to yield 108 - 6 - 6 = 96.
</path>
<conclusion>
the y-component of the sum is -49, and the z-component is 96.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
so the resulting vector is [-18, -49, 96].
wait, let me verify that:
first component: 6 (from first term) -12 (second term) -12 (third term) = 6 -24 = -18. correct.
second component: -42 (first term) +14 (second) -21 (third) = -42 +14 = -28; -28 -21 = -49. correct.
third component: 108 (first) -6 (second) -6 (third) = 108 -12 = 96. correct.
so the final vector is [-18, -49, 96].

3: the third term, -3(a × c), is confirmed by calculating -3 * [4, 7, 2], which equals [-12, -21, -6]. the correctness of this result is verified.

<conclusion>
the calculations for the individual terms are confirmed as correct: the first term is [6, -42, 108], the second term is [-12, 14, -6], and the third term is [-12, -21, -6].

adding all terms:
term1 components: 6, -42, 108

adding x-components: 6 -12 -12 +0 = -18

therefore, i need to provide the answer as "the final answer is [-18, -49, 96]" but in the column vector form. wait, but how is the answer formatted? since the given vectors are in column vector notation (with begin{pmatrix} ... \end{pmatrix}), then probably the answer should also be in that form.
wait, but the system here may not support latex. wait, no, the user's message has latex delimiters. wait, the original problem is written in latex delimiters, but i'm typing in a text box. the final answer should be written in a way that, when the assistant sends it, it's enclosed in \boxed{} and in latex. wait, but the user said "replace ... with the actual answer. ensure this exact phrase is included at the end of your response."
hmm. wait, the original problem was presented as:
"solve the following math problem: let $\mathbf{a},$ $\mathbf{b},$ $\mathbf{c}$ be three vectors such that
\[\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}.\]
solve: $(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})$."
so the answer should be in the form of a column vector within a pmatrix environment, enclosed in boxes. but since i'm writing in text, the user will format it properly. wait, no, the user specified that i should write the answer in the response, replacing the ellipsis with the actual answer. given the original problem uses latex column vectors with pmatrix, so likely the answer should be written in the same way.
therefore, the answer is:
\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}}
but let me confirm. the problem is from linear algebra, likely, and the answer is a vector, so column vector is appropriate. thus, yes.
therefore, after writing the reasoning, the final answer is boxed as above.
**final answer**
\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}}
</think>

answer: given the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\), \(\mathbf{b}\), and \(\mathbf{c}\) with the cross products:
\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix},
\]
we need to find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\).

using the distributive property of the cross product, we expand the expression:
\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}.
\]

calculating each term separately:
1. \(2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix}\),
2. \(2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -2 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) = -2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}\),
3. \(-\mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} = -3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) = -3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}\),
4. \(-\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}\).

adding these results component-wise:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 - 12 - 12 + 0 \\ -42 + 14 - 21 + 0 \\ 108 - 6 - 6 + 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}}
\]
