Okay, so I need to find the smallest number which is one less than twice its reciprocal.
Hmm, let me try to translate that into a mathematical equation.
Let's denote the number as x.
The reciprocal of x is 1/x.
Twice the reciprocal would be 2/(x).
One less than twice its reciprocal... that would be (2/(x)) - 1.
According to the problem, the number x is equal to this expression.
So, x = (2/x) - 1.
Is that right?
Let me verify.
So if I have a number x, its reciprocal is 1/x.
Twice that is 2/x.
Then, one less than that is 2/x minus 1.
So the equation x = 2/x - 1.
Yes, that seems correct.
Now, I need to solve this equation for x.
Let's see.
First, to solve x = 2/x - 1, maybe I can eliminate the denominator by multiplying both sides by x.
So, multiplying through by x gives:
x^2 = 2 - x.
That step was multiplying every term by x.
So now, x^2 + x - 2 = 0.
Converted the equation into a standard quadratic form.
Let's think in parallel.

1: The quadratic equation `x^2 + x - 2 = 0` is considered for factoring. The coefficients are identified as `a=1`, `b=1`, and `c=-2`. The process involves finding two numbers that multiply to `ac=-2` and sum to `b=1`. Potential pairs of factors for -2 are (1, -2), (-1, 2), (2, -1), and (-2, 1). The pair (2, -1) is identified as the correct pair because their product is -2 and their sum is 1. The quadratic equation is factored as `(x + 2)(x - 1) = 0`. Setting each factor to zero yields the solutions `x = -2` and `x = 1`.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The quadratic formula is applied to the equation `x^2 + x - 2 = 0`, where `a = 1`, `b = 1`, and `c = -2`. The discriminant `D` is calculated as `b^2 - 4ac`, which is `1^2 - 4(1)(-2)`, resulting in `1 + 8 = 9`. The square root of the discriminant is `√9 = 3`. The solutions are found using `x = (-b ± √D) / (2a)`, which becomes `x = (-1 ± 3) / 2`. This calculation yields two roots: `x = (-1 + 3) / 2 = 2/2 = 1` and `x = (-1 - 3) / 2 = -4/2 = -2`.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The quadratic equation `x^2 + x - 2 = 0` yields solutions x=1 and x=-2 through both factoring and the application of the quadratic formula.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So the solutions are x = 1 and x = -2.
Let's check if both satisfy the original equation.
Let's think in parallel.

1: Verification of x=1 as a solution to the original equation.

<Outline>
2: Verification of x=-2 as a solution to the original equation.

1: The solution x=1 is substituted into the original equation, `x = 2/x - 1`. The right-hand side (RHS) calculation is `2/1 - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1`. The left-hand side (LHS) is 1. Since the LHS equals the RHS, x=1 is a valid solution.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The solution x = -2 is tested in the original equation x = 2/x - 1. The left side evaluates to -2. The right side, 2/(-2) - 1, simplifies to -1 - 1, resulting in -2. The equality -2 = -2 holds true, confirming x = -2 is a valid solution.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
Both proposed solutions, x=1 and x=-2, satisfy the original equation x = 2/x - 1.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So both are valid.
But the problem asks for the smallest number.
Between 1 and -2, the smaller one is -2.
Therefore, the answer should be -2.
Wait, but when I first did it, I thought maybe the number has to be positive because of the way the problem is stated?
But actually, no.
The problem states "the smallest number which is one less than twice its reciprocal."
There's no restriction to positive numbers.
So negative numbers are allowed.
So -2 is valid, and it's smaller than 1.
So that's the correct answer.
Just to make sure there's no trick here.
Let me check again.
The reciprocal of -2 is -1/2.
Twice the reciprocal is 2*(-1/2) = -1.
One less than that is -1 -1 = -2.
Which equals the original number.
So that's correct.
Therefore, since it's asking for the smallest number, even though 1 is also a solution, -2 is smaller.
So the answer is -2.
Hmm, but the problem says "the smallest number which is one less than twice its reciprocal."
So yeah, -2.
So I think that's right.
Let me just think if there could be any other solutions.
Let me check by solving the quadratic equation again.
Starting from x = 2/x - 1.
Multiply both sides by x to eliminate the denominator:
x * x = x*(2/x - 1)
x2 = 2 - x
Then bring all terms to one side: x2 + x - 2 = 0.
Then factoring gives (x + 2)(x - 1) = 0.
So same as before.
So roots x = -2 and x=1.
So yes, that's correct.
So both solutions are valid.
Therefore, the smallest is -2.
Alright, seems good.
**Final Answer**
the final answer is \boxed{-2}
</Think>

Answer: To solve the problem of finding the smallest number which is one less than twice its reciprocal, we start by setting up the equation based on the given condition. Let the number be \( x \). The reciprocal of \( x \) is \( \frac{1}{x} \), twice the reciprocal is \( \frac{2}{x} \), and one less than twice the reciprocal is \( \frac{2}{x} - 1 \). According to the problem, the number \( x \) is equal to this expression:

\[
x = \frac{2}{x} - 1
\]

To eliminate the denominator, we multiply both sides by \( x \):

\[
x^2 = 2 - x
\]

Rearranging all terms to one side gives us the quadratic equation:

\[
x^2 + x - 2 = 0
\]

We factorize this quadratic equation:

\[
(x + 2)(x - 1) = 0
\]

Solving for \( x \), we get two solutions:

\[
x = -2 \quad \text{or} \quad x = 1
\]

We need to determine which of these solutions is the smallest. Checking both solutions in the original equation confirms they are both valid. The smaller of the two solutions is \( -2 \).

Thus, the smallest number which is one less than twice its reciprocal is:

\[
\boxed{-2}
\]
