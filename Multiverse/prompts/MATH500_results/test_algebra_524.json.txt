Okay, so I need to find the 2003rd term in the sequence of odd numbers starting from 1, then 3, 5, 7, and so on.
Hmm, let me recall how sequences work.
This seems like an arithmetic sequence where each term increases by 2.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: Determine the general formula for an arithmetic sequence and identify its components.

<Outline>
2: Calculate the first term and the common difference of the given sequence.

1: An arithmetic sequence is characterized by a constant difference between consecutive terms. The nth term of such a sequence can be found using the formula: a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d, where 'a_n' represents the nth term, 'a_1' is the first term, 'n' is the term number, and 'd' is the common difference.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The first term of the sequence is 1, and the common difference is 2.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The general formula for an arithmetic sequence is a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d, and for the given sequence of odd numbers, the first term (a_1) is 1 and the common difference (d) is 2.
</Conclusion>

Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: Determine the formula for the nth term of the specific sequence of odd numbers.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: Identify the value of 'n' for which the term is to be found.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The nth term of the given sequence of odd numbers is calculated using the formula a_n = 1 + (n - 1) * 2.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The term to be found is the 2003rd term, corresponding to n = 2003.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The formula for the nth term of the sequence is a_n = 1 + (n - 1) * 2, and the target term number is n = 2003.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Substitute n = 2003 into the formula: a_2003 = 1 + (2003 - 1) * 2.
Simplify the expression: 2003 - 1 is 2002, so a_2003 = 1 + 2002 * 2.
Multiply 2002 by 2, which is 4004.
Then add 1: 1 + 4004 = 4005.
Wait, so the 2003rd term is 4005?
Let's verify that.
Maybe with a smaller term.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: Determine the first term (n=1) using the formula.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: Determine the second term (n=2) using the formula.
</Outline>
<Outline>
3: Determine the third term (n=3) using the formula.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The first term (n=1) is calculated as 1 + (1-1)*2 = 1 + 0 = 1, which matches the sequence.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The formula a_n = 1 + (n - 1) * 2 yields a value of 3 for the second term (n=2), which matches the known sequence values.
</Path>
<Path>
3: The third term (n=3) is calculated as a_3 = 1 + (3-1)*2 = 1 + 2*2 = 5, which is correct.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The formula a_n = 1 + (n - 1) * 2 correctly generates the first term (1), the second term (3), and the third term (5).
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Yes, that works.
So for the 2003rd term, 2002 times 2 is 4004, plus 1 is 4005.
That seems right.
Let me just check again for any miscalculations.
2003 minus 1 is 2002.
Yes.
Then 2002 multiplied by 2 is 4004.
Adding 1 gives 4005.
Yes, that's correct.
Alternatively, since this is the sequence of odd numbers, the nth term can also be represented as 2n - 1.
Let me check that.
For n=1: 2*1 - 1 = 1.
For n=2: 2*2 -1 = 3.
For n=3: 2*3 -1=5.
Yup.
So the nth term is 2n -1.
Therefore, the 2003rd term would be 2*2003 -1.
Let's compute that: 2*2003 is 4006; subtract 1 gives 4005.
Wait, okay, that's the same answer.
But earlier when I did (2003 -1)*2 +1, it's similar to 2002*2 +1, which is 4004 +1=4005.
But using the formula 2n -1, it's 2*2003 -1=4006 -1=4005.
Same answer.
So that's consistent.
So both methods lead to 4005.
So that's correct.
Wait, so why are there two formulas?
Oh, because in the arithmetic sequence formula, it's a1 + (n-1)d, but the explicit formula for this sequence is 2n -1.
But they are equivalent.
Let's see: a_n = 1 + (n -1)*2 = 1 + 2n - 2 = 2n -1.
Yes, so they are the same.
So whether we use a_n = 1 + (n -1)*2 or a_n=2n -1, the result is the same.
So the answer is 4005.
Let me think again if I made a mistake in calculation.
Let's think in parallel.

1: Verification of the arithmetic sequence formula using the term n=2003.

<Path>
1: The arithmetic sequence formula a_n = a1 + (n-1)*d. For the term n=2003, the calculation 1 + (2003-1)*2 simplifies to 1 + 2002*2, then to 1 + 4004, resulting in 4005.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The formula for the nth term of odd numbers is a_n = 1 + (n-1)*2. For the 2003rd term (n=2003), this formula yields 1 + (2003-1)*2 = 1 + 2002*2 = 1 + 4004 = 4005.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
Both the arithmetic sequence formula a_n = 1 + (n-1)*2 and the explicit formula for odd numbers a_n = 2n - 1 yield the value 4005 for the 2003rd term.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So 4005 is correct.
Therefore, the 2003rd term is 4005.
**Final Answer** 
\boxed{4005}
</Think>

Answer: To find the 2003rd term of the sequence of odd numbers starting with 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., we recognize that this is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 1 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

The formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
\[ a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d \]

Substituting \( a_1 = 1 \), \( d = 2 \), and \( n = 2003 \) into the formula, we get:
\[ a_{2003} = 1 + (2003 - 1) \cdot 2 \]
\[ a_{2003} = 1 + 2002 \cdot 2 \]
\[ a_{2003} = 1 + 4004 \]
\[ a_{2003} = 4005 \]

We can also use the explicit formula for the \( n \)-th term of the sequence of odd numbers, which is \( a_n = 2n - 1 \). Substituting \( n = 2003 \) into this formula, we get:
\[ a_{2003} = 2 \cdot 2003 - 1 \]
\[ a_{2003} = 4006 - 1 \]
\[ a_{2003} = 4005 \]

Both methods confirm that the 2003rd term is 4005.

\[
\boxed{4005}
\]
