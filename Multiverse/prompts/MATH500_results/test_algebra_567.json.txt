Okay, so I need to solve the equation |5x - 1| = x + 3 and find the largest value of x that works. Hmm, absolute value equations can have multiple cases because the expression inside the absolute value can be either positive or negative. Let me remember the general approach here. When dealing with absolute values, you usually split the equation into two cases: one where the inside is non-negative, so the absolute value can be removed without changing the sign, and another where the inside is negative, so you have to flip the sign when removing the absolute value.
Let's think in parallel.

1: Determine the equation when the expression inside the absolute value, 5x - 1, is non-negative (Case 1).
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: Determine the equation when the expression inside the absolute value, 5x - 1, is negative (Case 2).
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: Case 1: 5x - 1 ≥ 0, which is equivalent to x ≥ 1/5, then |5x - 1| = 5x - 1. So the equation becomes 5x - 1 = x + 3.
</Path>
<Path>
2: Case 2: If 5x - 1 is negative (i.e., 5x - 1 < 0, which simplifies to x < 1/5), so the condition for Case 2 is x <1/5), then the absolute value becomes -(5x -1). So the equation becomes -(5x - 1) = x + 3. Let's write both cases down:
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The two cases for the absolute value equation are identified: Case 1 (x ≥ 1/5) results in the equation 5x - 1 = x + 3, and Case 2 (x < 1/5) results in the equation -(5x - 1) = x + 3.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Let's solve both equations and then check the solutions against the conditions for each case.
Let's think in parallel.

1: Solve Case 1: 5x - 1 = x + 3, under the condition x ≥ 1/5.

2: Solve Case 2: -(5x - 1) = x + 3, under the condition x < 1/5.
</Outline>

<Path>
1: First, Case 1: 5x - 1 = x + 3. Let me solve for x. Subtract x from both sides: 5x - x -1 = 3 4x -1 = 3 Add 1 to both sides: 4x = 4 Divide by 4: x = 1 = 1. So x = 1. Now, check if this solution satisfies the condition x ≥ 1/5. 1 is indeed greater than or equal to 0.2, so that's valid. So x = 1 is a potential solution.
</Path>
<Path>
2: Case 2: Solve -(5x - 1) = x + 3. First, distribute the negative sign: -5x + 1 = x + 3. Let's solve for x. Subtract x from both sides: -5x - x + 1 = 3 Subtract 1 from both sides: -6x = 2 Divide by -6: x = 2 / (-6) = -1/3. So x = -1/3. Now, we need to check if this solution satisfies the condition for Case 2, which was x < 1/5. Since -1/3 is indeed less than 1/5 (because -1/3 ≈ -0.333 and 1/5 = 0.2), x = -1/3 is a valid solution for Case 2.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
Case 1 yields the solution x = 1, which satisfies its condition x ≥ 1/5. Case 2 yields the solution x = -1/3, which satisfies its condition x < 1/5.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So, now we have two potential solutions: x = 1 and x = -1/3. But the problem asks for the largest value of x that satisfies the equation. Between 1 and -1/3, the larger one is clearly 1. But before finalizing that as the answer, I should verify both solutions in the original equation to be safe.

1: The solution x=1/3 is verified by substituting it into the original equation |5x - 1| = x + 3. The left side (LS) is |5(-1/3) - 1| = |5/3 - 1| = |2/3| = 2/3. The right side (RS) is (-1/3) + 3 = 8/3. Since 2/3 does not equal 8/3, the solution x=-1/3 is incorrect. This contradiction suggests an error in the initial reasoning or calculations.

1.1: Case 1: 5x - 1 = x + 3. Subtract x from both sides: 4x - 1 = 3. Add 1 to both sides: 4x = 4. Divide by 4: x = 1.
</Path>
<Path>
1.2: Case 2: -(5x - 1) = x + 3. Expand the left side: -5x + 1 = x + 3. Subtract x from both sides: -6x + 1 = 3. Subtract 1 from both sides: -6x = 2. Divide by -6: x = -2/6 = -1/3. The re-verification confirms that x=-1/3 is the correct solution for Case 2.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The re-solved solutions are x=1 for Case 1 and x=-1/3 for Case 2.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
The solutions are x=1 and x=-1/3. The problem asks for the largest value of x. Between 1 and -1/3, 1 is the larger value. The verification of x=1 in the original equation is performed. The left side (LS) is |5(1) - 1| = |5 - 1| = |4| = 4. The right side (RS) is 1 + 3 = 4. Since 4 equals 4, the solution x=1 is valid.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The solution x=-1/3 is verified in the original equation. The left side (LS) is |5*(-1/3) - 1|, which simplifies to |-5/3 -1)| = |-5/3 -3/3| = |-8/3| = 8/3 ≈ 2.6667. The right side (RS) is (-1/3) = 3/3 -1/3 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667, and 8/3 does not equal 2/3, this indicates an error in the verification process.
The verification process for x=-1/3 is re-examined.
The right side (RS) of the original equation is x + 3.
The value of x is -1/3
The RS is calculated as -1/3 + 3, which equals -1/3: 1: The right side (RS) is calculated as x + 3.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The solution x=1 is valid as it satisfies the original equation. The solution x=-1/3 was initially found but was later determined to be invalid through verification. The re-verification process identified an error in the initial verification of x=-1/3, which led to a re-evaluation of the solutions. The re-solved solutions are x=1 and x=-1/3. The re-verification of x=1 confirms its validity, while the re-verification of x=-1/3 shows it is invalid (LS=8/3 ≠ RS=2/3). The final valid solutions are x=1 and x=-1/3, with x=1 being the largest.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Wait, but according to Case 2, x=-1/3 was a valid solution. But when I plug into the original equation, the left side is |5*(-1/3) -1| = |-5/3 -3/3| = |-8/3| = 8/3, and the right side is x + 3 = -1/3 + 3 = 8/3. Wait, 8/3 is approximately 2.666, and 8/3 does equal 8/3. So that works. Wait, I must have miscalculated before. Wait, no, let me recheck: For x = -1/3, Left Side: |5x -1| = |5*(-1/3) -1| = |(-5/3 -3/3)| = |-8/3| = 8/3. Right Side: x + 3 = -1/3 + 3 = -1/3 + 9/3 = 8/3. So 8/3 = 8/3. That works. So x = -1/3 is indeed a solution. So why did I think it didn't work before? Maybe I added wrong. But yes, x = -1/3 does satisfy the equation. So both x = 1 and x = -1/3 are solutions. Therefore, the largest value of x is 1.

Answer: To solve the equation \( |5x - 1| = x + 3 \) and find the largest value of \( x \):

1. **Case 1: \( 5x - 1 \geq 0 \) (i.e., \( x \geq \frac{1}{5} \))**
   - The equation becomes \( 5x - 1 = x + 3 \)
   - Solving:
     \[
     5x - x = 3 + 1 \implies 4x = 4 \implies x = 1
     \]
   - Check condition: \( 1 \geq \frac{1}{5} \) (valid)

2. **Case 2: \( 5x - 1 < 0 \) (i.e., \( x < \frac{1}{5} \))**
   - The equation becomes \( -(5x - 1) = x + 3 \)
   - Solving:
     \[
     -5x + 1 = x + 3 \implies -6x = 2 \implies x = -\frac{1}{3}
     \]
   - Check condition: \( -\frac{1}{3} < \frac{1}{5} \) (valid)

3. **Verification:**
   - For \( x = 1 \):
     \[
     |5(1) - 1| = |4| = 4 \quad \text{and} \quad 1 + 3 = 4 \quad \text{(satisfies)}
     \]
   - For \( x = -\frac{1}{3} \):
     \[
     \left| 5\left(-\frac{1}{3}\right) - 1 \right| = \left| -\frac{8}{3} \right| = \frac{8}{3} \quad \text{and} \quad -\frac{1}{3} + 3 = \frac{8}{3} \quad \text{(satisfies)}
     \]

The largest value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation is \(\boxed{1}\).

     5x - x = 3 + 1 \implies 4x = 4 \implies x = 1
     \]
   - check condition: \( 1 \geq \frac{1}{5} \) (valid)

2. **case 2: \( 5x - 1 < 0 \) (i.e., \( x < \frac{1}{5} \))**
   - the equation becomes \( -(5x - 1) = x + 3 \)
   - solving:
