<Conclusion>
The area of the sector formed by angle ADC in the larger circle is πθ/90, and the area of the segment is this sector area minus the area of triangle ADC.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Similarly, in the smaller circle, there's another segment.
The shaded region is the area of the larger segment plus the area of the smaller segment?
Wait, looking back at the diagram, maybe the shaded region is the two segments combined?
Let me confirm.
The shaded area is the area of the two segments on either side of the line ADC.
So, each segment is bounded by the chord AC and the arc from the larger circle and the arc from the smaller circle.
Wait, maybe not.
Let's parse the diagram carefully.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>

</Outline>
<Outline>
2: The boundary of the shaded region in the smaller circle.

<Path>
1: The shaded region in the larger circle is bounded by the arc from point A to point C (passing through an upper position) and the chord AC.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The shaded region is also bounded by an arc of the smaller circle, connecting points A and C. The chord AC is a common boundary for both segments.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The shaded region in the larger circle is bounded by the arc from A to C (passing upwards) and the chord AC, while the shaded region in the smaller circle is bounded by the arc from A to C (passing upwards) and the same chord AC.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So, the total shaded area is the area between chord AC and the two arcs (one from the larger circle and one from the smaller circle).
Hmm, so maybe the total shaded area is the difference between the sector of the larger circle and the sector of the smaller circle, minus the triangle?
Wait, maybe not.
Let me think.
If you have a chord AC, then in the larger circle, the area of the segment is the area of the sector minus the area of the triangle.
Similarly, in the smaller circle, the area of the segment is the area of the sector minus the area of the same triangle.
But in this problem, is the shaded area the sum of these two segments?
Looking at the diagram again, the shaded region seems to be the two lens-shaped areas between the two circles and the chord AC.
So, that would be the area of the sector of the larger circle minus the area of the triangle, plus the area of the sector of the smaller circle minus the same triangle.
But wait, the triangle is subtracted twice?
Wait, maybe not.
Let me visualize.
The chord AC divides each circle into two regions.
In the larger circle, the sector is the pie slice including the triangle, and the segment is the pie slice minus the triangle.
Similarly, in the smaller circle, the segment is the small pie slice minus the triangle.
But since the triangle is part of both sectors, if we subtract the triangle from both sectors, then adding the two segments would give us the shaded area?
Or is the shaded area the two regions between the two arcs and the chord?
If the chord AC is part of the boundary, then maybe the shaded area is the area inside the larger sector but outside the smaller sector.
Wait, but the smaller circle's sector is entirely inside the larger circle's sector.
So, if you take the larger sector minus the smaller sector, you'd get the area between the two arcs, which is the shaded region.
But then why subtract the triangle twice?
Wait, maybe the area between the two arcs (shaded) is equal to (larger sector - triangle) + (smaller sector - triangle).
Which is (larger sector + smaller sector - 2 * triangle).
Wait, but that seems strange.
Alternatively, perhaps the area is just the larger sector minus the smaller sector.
Because if both sectors are bounded by the same central angle, then the area between them (the annular sector) would be the difference of their areas.
But in the diagram, the chord AC is a common boundary, so maybe the shaded area is the annular sector bounded by the two arcs and the radii DA and DC.
But in the diagram, the shading is on both sides of the chord AC.
Wait, looking at the problem statement: "the total area of the shaded region is 5/12 of the area of the larger circle."
So, if the larger circle has area 4π, then the shaded area is (5/12)*4π = (5/3)π.
So, numerical value is about 5.236.
So, the problem is telling us that the shaded area is this value, and from that, we need to find the angle ADC.
But first, I need to model the shaded area in terms of theta, then set it equal to 5π/12, then solve for theta.

But in this problem, the chord AC is part of both circles.
Wait, chord AC is the same physical line in both circles.
So, the triangle ADC is a triangle with sides AD=2, DC=2 (since D is the center and A and C are on the larger circle).
Wait, no.
Wait, center is D.
For the larger circle, radius is 2, so DA = DC = 2.
For the smaller circle, radius is 1, so maybe the points A and C are such that their positions on the larger circle correspond to points on the smaller circle?
Wait, no.
The smaller circle has radius 1, so if A and C are points on the larger circle, their corresponding positions on the smaller circle would be halfway between D and A, and D and C, perhaps?
Wait, looking at the diagram again, maybe points A and C are such that there are two circles centered at D, with radii 1 and 2, and chord AC intersects both circles, creating segments in both.
But chord AC is a chord of both circles?
Wait, no, chord AC is only a chord of the larger circle.
Wait, but in the diagram, the chord AC is a chord of the larger circle (radius 2), but the smaller circle (radius 1) is such that the line AC extended intersects it?
Or is point A on both circles?
Wait, if the circles are centered at D, and radii 1 and 2, then if A is on the smaller circle, it can't be on the larger circle unless it's at the same position as D, but centers can't be on the circle.
Wait, maybe point A is on the smaller circle and point C is on the larger circle?
But the problem statement refers to two circles each with center D.
So, both circles are centered at D, with radii 1 and 2.
Then points A and C are on the circles.
Let me reorient.
Since D is the center, if A is on the smaller circle (radius 1) and C is on the larger circle (radius 2).
Wait, but in the diagram, both A and C seem to be on the larger circle.
Hmmm.
Wait, maybe the diagram is misleading.
Wait, the problem says "two circles, each with center D, have radii of 1 and 2."
So, both circles are centered at D, with radii 1 and 2.
So, points A and C can be on either circle?
But the line ADC is a line starting at A, going through D, to C?
Wait, no.
The angle ADC is formed by points A, D, and C.
Since D is the center, angle ADC is a central angle.
So, A and C are two points on the circles such that angle ADC is the angle between DA and DC.
Wait, but DA and DC are radii of the circles.
But DA could be a radius of the smaller circle (length 1) or the larger (length 2).
Wait, the problem mentions "the smaller angle ∠ADC".
Hmm.
Wait, the problem is asking for the measure of the smaller ∠ADC.
So, angle ADC is some angle, and we need to find its measure in degrees.
Given that the total shaded area is 5/12 of the larger circle's area.

The area of this annular sector is calculated as the difference between the area of the sector in the larger circle and the area of the sector in the smaller circle. The area of a sector in a circle is given by the formula (θ/360) * πr². Consequently, the area of the sector in the larger circle is (θ/360) * π * 2², which simplifies to (θ/360) * 4π. Similarly, the area of the sector in the smaller circle is (θ/360) * π * 1², equivalent to (θ/360) * π. The difference between these sector areas, representing the annular sector, is (θ/360) * 4π - (θ/360) * π, which simplifies to (θ/360) * 3π, or (3πθ)/360, and further reduces to (πθ)/120.

Points A and C are on the smaller and larger concentric circles, respectively. The angle ∠ADC is a central angle formed by radii DA and DC.

2: The problem states that the total area of the shaded region is 5/12 of the area of the larger circle, which is 4π. The shaded region is composed of two segments, one from the larger circle and one from the smaller circle. The area of the segment in the larger circle is (θ/360) * 4π - 2 * sin(θ), and the area of the segment in the smaller circle is (θ/360) * π - 0.5 * sin(θ). The total shaded area is the sum of these two segment areas, (θ/360) * 4π - 2 * sin(θ) + (θ/360) * π - 0.5 * sin(θ), which simplifies to (θ/360) * 5π - 2.5 * sin(θ). This sum of segments is set equal to (5/12) * 4π, resulting in the equation (5πθ/360) - 2.5sin(θ) = (5π)/3. This equation is further simplified by multiplying both sides by 2, yielding (5πθ)/360 - 5sin(θ) = (10π)/3, and then by 12/π, giving (5θ)/60 - (60/π)sin(θ) = 20/π.

The annular sector area model yields the equation (πθ)/120 - sin(θ) = 5π/12, while the sum of two segment areas model results in the equation (5θ)/60 - (60/π)sin(θ) = 20/π.

But both of these equations involve θ in both a trigonometric function and a linear term, so they likely require numerical methods to solve.
However, the problem is given in a context where maybe a nice angle is expected.
Let me check the problem constraints again.
Wait, the answer is expected to be in degrees, and the final answer is to be boxed.
Given that the problem is about circles with radii 1 and 2, and the fraction 5/12, perhaps the angle is a standard angle.
Alternatively, maybe I made a wrong assumption about the shaded area.
Let me think again.
Wait, the diagram shows two shaded regions: one is a segment of the larger circle, and the other is a segment of the smaller circle.
But they are on opposite sides of the chord AC.
So, the total shaded area is the area of the two segments.

Therefore, total shaded area is [ (πθ)/90 - 2sinθ ] + [ (πθ)/360 - (1/2)sinθ ] = (πθ)/72 - (5/2)sinθ.
Wait, let's compute that again: (πθ)/90 + (πθ)/360 = (4πθ + πθ)/360 = 5πθ/360 = πθ/72.
And the sine terms: -2sinθ - (1/2)sinθ = -(5/2)sinθ.
So total shaded area is (πθ)/72 - (5/2)sinθ.
Set this equal to 5π/12: (πθ)/72 - (5/2)sinθ = 5π/12.
Multiply both sides by 72 to eliminate denominators: πθ - 180 sinθ = 30π.
So, πθ - 180 sinθ = 30π.
Divide both sides by π: θ - (180 sinθ)/π = 30.
So, θ - (180/π) sinθ = 30.
This is a transcendental equation, so it can't be solved algebraically.
We need to solve it numerically.
But the problem is given in a context where maybe a nice angle is expected.
Let's think in parallel.

1: Substituting θ=60° into the equation θ - (180/π)sinθ = 30 yields 60 - (180/π)(√3/2) ≈ 60 - 51.82 ≈ 8.18, which is not equal to 30.
</Path>
<Path>
2: Substituting θ=90° into the equation θ - (180/π)sinθ = 30 yields 90 - (180/π)sin(90°). The value of sin(90°) is 1, so the expression becomes 90 - (180/π). This is approximately 90 - 57.32, which is about 32.68. This result is greater than 30.

<Path>
3: The equation is evaluated for θ=120°. The term (180/π)sin(120°) is approximately (57.2958)(0.8660), which is about 49.63. This value is subtracted from 120, yielding 120 - 49.63 = 70.37. This result (70.37) is greater than the required 30.
</Path>
<Path>
4: For θ=150°, the value of sinθ is sin(150°) = 0.5. Substituting θ=150° into the left side of the equation results in 150 - (180/π) * 0.5. The term (180/π) * 0.5 is approximately 28.6479. The left side of the equation is approximately 150 - 28.6479, which is about 121.3521. This value is not equal to the right side, 30.

<Path>
5: For θ=180°, the left side of the equation θ - (180/π)sinθ is 180 - (180/π)sin(180°) = 180 - 0 = 180, which does not equal the right side of 30.

The equation θ - (180/π)sinθ = 30 is not satisfied for θ values of 60°, 90°, 120°, 150°, or 180°.

</Parallel>
Wait, perhaps 100 degrees.
Let me try θ=100°.
So, θ - (180/π) sinθ ≈ 100 - 57.2958 * sin(100°).
First, sin(100°) ≈ 0.9848.
So, 57.2958 * 0.9848 ≈ 56.46.
Then, 100 - 56.46 ≈ 43.54, which is still bigger than 30.
How about θ=130°: sin(130°)=sin(50°)≈0.7660.
Then, (180/π)*0.7660≈57.2958*0.7660≈43.74.
So, 130 - 43.74≈86.26≠30.
Hmm.
Maybe θ=210°: but that's a reflex angle.
Wait, the problem says "the smaller angle ∠ADC".
So, θ is acute or maybe obtuse?
Let's see.
Wait, the shaded area is 5/12 of the larger circle, which is about 5/12 of 12.566≈5.233.
So, around 5.233 is the area.
If we go back to the original equation: (πθ)/72 - (5/2)sinθ = 5π/12 ≈ 5*3.1416/12 ≈1.31.
Wait, wait.
Wait, the shaded area is (πθ)/72 - (5/2)sinθ =5π/12≈5.233.
Wait, that conflicts with my previous calculation.
Wait, no.
Wait, (πθ)/72 - (5/2)sinθ=5π/12.
Multiply both sides by 72: πθ - 180 sinθ=30π≈94.248.
So, equation is θ - (180/π) sinθ=30.
So, when I plug in θ=60: 60 - 57.2958* sin60≈60 - 57.2958*0.8660≈60 - 49.63≈10.37≠30.
Not 30.
So, θ needs to be larger.
Let's try θ=120: 120 - 57.2958* sin120≈120 - 57.2958*0.8660≈120 - 49.63≈70.37.
Still too big.
θ=90:90 -57.2958*1=90-57.2958≈32.70>30.
Close.
Let me try θ=85.
Compute sin(85°).
Sin(85)≈0.9962.
So, θ - (180/π) sinθ ≈85 -57.2958*0.9962≈85 -57.05≈27.95.
Close to 30, but a bit low.
θ=86: sin(86)≈0.9976.
So, 86 -57.2958*0.9976≈86 -57.13≈28.87.
Still low.
θ=87: sin(87)≈0.9989.
87 -57.2958*0.9989≈87 -57.19≈29.81.
Close, still a bit less than 30.
θ=87.5: sin(87.5)=sin(87.5°)≈sin(π/2 - π/48)=cos(π/48)≈0.998 approx.
Wait, more precise: Using calculator, sin(87.5)≈0.9978.
So, 87.5 -57.2958*0.9978≈87.5 -57.13≈30.37.
Slightly over 30.
So between θ=87 and 87.5.
Let's do linear approximation.
At θ=87, value is 29.81.
At θ=87.5, value is approx 30.37.
So, the change is 0.5 theta gives change in value from 29.81 to 30.37, so a change of 0.56.
We need to reach 30.
So, from 87 to 87.5 is 0.5 degrees, the function increases by 0.56.
We need to go up by 0.19 (from 29.81 to 30).
So, delta_theta≈0.5 *0.19 /0.56≈0.16.
So, approximate solution at 87 +0.16≈87.16 degrees.
But maybe more accurate calculation.
Alternatively, use Newton-Raphson.
Let f(θ)=θ - (180/π) sinθ -30.
We need to solve f(θ)=0.

1: For θ=87.15°, the value of f(θ) is calculated as 87.15 - (180/π) * sin(87.15°) - 30, which simplifies to 87.15 - 57.2958 * 0.9978 - 30. This calculation yields an approximate value of 87.15 - 57.14 - 30, which is about 87.15 - 87.14, or approximately 0.01.

The value of f(θ) is approximately 0.01 at θ=87.15° and approximately 0.023 at θ=87.16°.

So, very close.
Thus, θ≈87.15 degrees.
But the problem asks for an exact answer?
Wait, the problem says "how many degrees are in the measure of (the smaller) ∠ADC?"
Wait, but 87.15 degrees is not a standard angle.
However, perhaps there's an exact solution I missed.
Wait, maybe my model is wrong.
Wait, going back, is the shaded area indeed the sum of the two segments?
Or is it the annular sector minus the triangle once?
Wait, perhaps I need to think of the shaded area as the area between the two circles from angle 0 to theta.
Wait, imagine the two circles, radius 1 and 2, centered at D.
Then, if you have a sector of angle theta in both circles, the area between those sectors (annular sector) is the difference of the two sectors.
But in this problem, the diagram shows shading between the two circles from the chord AC, which might correspond to angle theta.
So, the area of the annular

similarly, in the smaller circle, there's another segment.
the shaded region is the area of the larger segment plus the area of the smaller segment?
wait, looking back at the diagram, maybe the shaded region is the two segments combined?
let me confirm.
the shaded area is the area of the two segments on either side of the line adc.
so, each segment is bounded by the chord ac and the arc from the larger circle and the arc from the smaller circle.
wait, maybe not.
let's parse the diagram carefully.
let's think in parallel.

</path>
<conclusion>
the shaded region in the larger circle is bounded by the arc from a to c (passing upwards) and the chord ac, while the shaded region in the smaller circle is bounded by the arc from a to c (passing upwards) and the same chord ac.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
so, the total shaded area is the area between chord ac and the two arcs (one from the larger circle and one from the smaller circle).
hmm, so maybe the total shaded area is the difference between the sector of the larger circle and the sector of the smaller circle, minus the triangle?
wait, maybe not.
let me think.
if you have a chord ac, then in the larger circle, the area of the segment is the area of the sector minus the area of the triangle.
similarly, in the smaller circle, the area of the segment is the area of the sector minus the area of the same triangle.
but in this problem, is the shaded area the sum of these two segments?
looking at the diagram again, the shaded region seems to be the two lens-shaped areas between the two circles and the chord ac.
so, that would be the area of the sector of the larger circle minus the area of the triangle, plus the area of the sector of the smaller circle minus the same triangle.
but wait, the triangle is subtracted twice?
wait, maybe not.
let me visualize.
the chord ac divides each circle into two regions.
in the larger circle, the sector is the pie slice including the triangle, and the segment is the pie slice minus the triangle.
similarly, in the smaller circle, the segment is the small pie slice minus the triangle.
but since the triangle is part of both sectors, if we subtract the triangle from both sectors, then adding the two segments would give us the shaded area?
or is the shaded area the two regions between the two arcs and the chord?
if the chord ac is part of the boundary, then maybe the shaded area is the area inside the larger sector but outside the smaller sector.
wait, but the smaller circle's sector is entirely inside the larger circle's sector.
so, if you take the larger sector minus the smaller sector, you'd get the area between the two arcs, which is the shaded region.
but then why subtract the triangle twice?
wait, maybe the area between the two arcs (shaded) is equal to (larger sector - triangle) + (smaller sector - triangle).
which is (larger sector + smaller sector - 2 * triangle).
wait, but that seems strange.
alternatively, perhaps the area is just the larger sector minus the smaller sector.
because if both sectors are bounded by the same central angle, then the area between them (the annular sector) would be the difference of their areas.
but in the diagram, the chord ac is a common boundary, so maybe the shaded area is the annular sector bounded by the two arcs and the radii da and dc.
but in the diagram, the shading is on both sides of the chord ac.
wait, looking at the problem statement: "the total area of the shaded region is 5/12 of the area of the larger circle."
so, if the larger circle has area 4π, then the shaded area is (5/12)*4π = (5/3)π.
so, numerical value is about 5.236.
so, the problem is telling us that the shaded area is this value, and from that, we need to find the angle adc.
but first, i need to model the shaded area in terms of theta, then set it equal to 5π/12, then solve for theta.

but in this problem, the chord ac is part of both circles.
wait, chord ac is the same physical line in both circles.
so, the triangle adc is a triangle with sides ad=2, dc=2 (since d is the center and a and c are on the larger circle).
wait, no.
wait, center is d.
for the larger circle, radius is 2, so da = dc = 2.
for the smaller circle, radius is 1, so maybe the points a and c are such that their positions on the larger circle correspond to points on the smaller circle?
wait, no.
the smaller circle has radius 1, so if a and c are points on the larger circle, their corresponding positions on the smaller circle would be halfway between d and a, and d and c, perhaps?
wait, looking at the diagram again, maybe points a and c are such that there are two circles centered at d, with radii 1 and 2, and chord ac intersects both circles, creating segments in both.
but chord ac is a chord of both circles?
wait, no, chord ac is only a chord of the larger circle.
wait, but in the diagram, the chord ac is a chord of the larger circle (radius 2), but the smaller circle (radius 1) is such that the line ac extended intersects it?
or is point a on both circles?
wait, if the circles are centered at d, and radii 1 and 2, then if a is on the smaller circle, it can't be on the larger circle unless it's at the same position as d, but centers can't be on the circle.
wait, maybe point a is on the smaller circle and point c is on the larger circle?
but the problem statement refers to two circles each with center d.
so, both circles are centered at d, with radii 1 and 2.
then points a and c are on the circles.
let me reorient.
since d is the center, if a is on the smaller circle (radius 1) and c is on the larger circle (radius 2).
wait, but in the diagram, both a and c seem to be on the larger circle.
hmmm.
wait, maybe the diagram is misleading.
wait, the problem says "two circles, each with center d, have radii of 1 and 2."
so, both circles are centered at d, with radii 1 and 2.
so, points a and c can be on either circle?
but the line adc is a line starting at a, going through d, to c?
wait, no.
the angle adc is formed by points a, d, and c.
since d is the center, angle adc is a central angle.
so, a and c are two points on the circles such that angle adc is the angle between da and dc.
wait, but da and dc are radii of the circles.
but da could be a radius of the smaller circle (length 1) or the larger (length 2).
wait, the problem mentions "the smaller angle ∠adc".
hmm.
wait, the problem is asking for the measure of the smaller ∠adc.
so, angle adc is some angle, and we need to find its measure in degrees.

but in this problem, the chord ac is part of both circles.
wait, chord ac is the same physical line in both circles.
so, the triangle adc is a triangle with sides ad=2, dc=2 (since d is the center and a and c are on the larger circle).
wait, no.
center is d.
for the larger circle, radius is 2, so da = dc = 2.
for the smaller circle, radius is 1, so maybe the points a and c are such that their positions on the smaller circle correspond to halfway between d and a, and d and c, perhaps?
wait, no.
the smaller circle has radius 1, so if a and c are points on the larger circle, their corresponding positions on the smaller circle would be halfway between d and a, and d and c, perhaps?
wait, looking at the diagram again, maybe points a and c are such that there are two circles centered at d, with radii 1 and 2, and chord ac intersects both circles, creating segments in both.
but chord ac is a chord of both circles?
wait, no, chord ac is only a chord of the larger circle.
wait, but in the diagram, the chord ac is a chord of the larger circle (radius 2), but the smaller circle (radius 1) is such that the line ac extended intersects it?
or is point a on both circles?
wait, if the circles are centered at d, and radii 1 and 2, then if a is on the smaller circle, it can't be on the larger circle unless it's at the same position as d, but centers can't be on the circle.
wait, maybe point a is on the smaller circle and point c is on the larger circle?
but the problem statement refers to two circles, each with center d, have radii of 1 and 2.
so, both circles are centered at d, with radii 1 and 2.
then points a and c are on the circles.

1: points a and c are situated on the two concentric circles centered at d, with radii 1 and 2. point a is on the smaller circle (radius 1), and point c is on the larger circle (radius 2). the line segment adc connects points a, d, and c, forming a straight line through the center d. this implies that angle adc is a central angle, and the positions of points a and c on their respective circles are such that the angle's sides are the radii da and dc. the angle ∠adc is formed by the intersection of radii da and dc. the problem specifies the need to find the measure of the smaller angle ∠adc.

4: the problem states that the shaded area is 5/12 of the area of the larger circle. the total area of the larger circle is 4π. therefore, the area of the annular sector is (5/12) * 4π = (5π)/3. the annular sector is formed between the two concentric circles with radii 1 and 2, corresponding to the central angle θ. the area of this annular sector is calculated as the difference between the area of the sector in the larger circle and the area of the sector in the smaller circle. the area of a sector in a circle is given by the formula (θ/360) * πr². consequently, the area of the sector in the larger circle is (θ/360) * π * 2², which simplifies to (θ/360) * 4π. similarly, the area of the sector in the smaller circle is (θ/360) * π * 1², equivalent to (θ/360) * π. the difference between these sector areas, representing the annular sector, is (θ/360) * 4π - (θ/360) * π, which simplifies to (θ/360) * 3π, or (3πθ)/360, and further reduces to (πθ)/120.

5: the area of triangle adc is determined using the formula (1/2) * base * height * sin(angle). in this configuration, the base is the radius of the smaller circle (1), the height is the radius of the larger circle (2), and the angle is θ, leading to an area of (1/2) * 1 * 2 * sin(θ), which simplifies to sin(θ).
</path>
<conclusion>
points a and c are on the smaller and larger concentric circles, respectively. the angle ∠adc is a central angle formed by radii da and dc. the total shaded area is (5π)/3, equivalent to 5/12 of the larger circle's area. this shaded area corresponds to the annular sector between the two concentric circles, which has an area of (πθ)/120. the area of triangle adc is sin(θ).

so, according to this model, the equation is (πθ)/120 - sin(θ) = 5π/12.
but solving (πθ)/120 - sin(θ) = 5π/12.
hmm.

2: the problem states that the total area of the shaded region is 5/12 of the area of the larger circle, which is 4π. the shaded region is composed of two segments, one from the larger circle and one from the smaller circle. the area of the segment in the larger circle is (θ/360) * 4π - 2 * sin(θ), and the area of the segment in the smaller circle is (θ/360) * π - 0.5 * sin(θ). the total shaded area is the sum of these two segment areas, (θ/360) * 4π - 2 * sin(θ) + (θ/360) * π - 0.5 * sin(θ), which simplifies to (θ/360) * 5π - 2.5 * sin(θ). this sum of segments is set equal to (5/12) * 4π, resulting in the equation (5πθ/360) - 2.5sin(θ) = (5π)/3. this equation is further simplified by multiplying both sides by 2, yielding (5πθ)/360 - 5sin(θ) = (10π)/3, and then by 12/π, giving (5θ)/60 - (60/π)sin(θ) = 20/π.
</path>
<conclusion>
the annular sector area model yields the equation (πθ)/120 - sin(θ) = 5π/12, while the sum of two segment areas model results in the equation (5θ)/60 - (60/π)sin(θ) = 20/π.

but both of these equations involve θ in both a trigonometric function and a linear term, so they likely require numerical methods to solve.
however, the problem is given in a context where maybe a nice angle is expected.
let me check the problem constraints again.
wait, the answer is expected to be in degrees, and the final answer is to be boxed.
given that the problem is about circles with radii 1 and 2, and the fraction 5/12, perhaps the angle is a standard angle.
alternatively, maybe i made a wrong assumption about the shaded area.
let me think again.
wait, the diagram shows two shaded regions: one is a segment of the larger circle, and the other is a segment of the smaller circle.
but they are on opposite sides of the chord ac.
so, the total shaded area is the area of the two segments.
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>
<goal>
<outline>
1: the area of the segment formed by angle adc in the larger circle.
</outline>
<outline>
2: the area of the segment formed by angle adc in the smaller circle.
</outline>
</goal>
<path>
1: the area of the segment in the larger circle, corresponding to angle adc, is calculated by subtracting the area of triangle adc from the area of the sector. the sector area is (θ/360) * π * 2², simplifying to (4πθ)/360, which is equivalent to (πθ)/90. the area of triangle adc, with sides da=2 and dc=2, is (1/2) * 2 * 2 * sin(θ), resulting in 2sin(θ). therefore, the segment area for the larger circle is (πθ)/90 - 2sin(θ).
</path>
<path>
2: the area of the segment within the smaller circle, corresponding to angle adc, is determined by subtracting the area of triangle adc from the area of the smaller sector, calculated as (θ/360) * π * 1² - (1/2) * 1 * 1 * sin(θ), which simplifies to (πθ)/360 - (1/2)sin(θ).
</path>
<conclusion>
the segment area for the larger circle is (πθ)/90 - 2sin(θ), and the segment area for the smaller circle is (πθ)/360 - (1/2)sin(θ).
</conclusion>
</parallel>
therefore, total shaded area is [ (πθ)/90 - 2sinθ ] + [ (πθ)/360 - (1/2)sinθ ] = (πθ)/72 - (5/2)sinθ.
wait, let's compute that again: (πθ)/90 + (πθ)/360 = (4πθ + πθ)/360 = 5πθ/360 = πθ/72.
and the sine terms: -2sinθ - (1/2)sinθ = -(5/2)sinθ.
so total shaded area is (πθ)/72 - (5/2)sinθ.
set this equal to 5π/12: (πθ)/72 - (5/2)sinθ = 5π/12.
multiply both sides by 72 to eliminate denominators: πθ - 180 sinθ = 30π.
so, πθ - 180 sinθ = 30π.
divide both sides by π: θ - (180 sinθ)/π = 30.
so, θ - (180/π) sinθ = 30.
this is a transcendental equation, so it can't be solved algebraically.
we need to solve it numerically.
but the problem is given in a context where maybe a nice angle is expected.
let's think in parallel.

<path>
1: substituting θ=60° into the equation θ - (180/π)sinθ = 30 yields 60 - (180/π)(√3/2) ≈ 60 - 51.82 ≈ 8.18, which is not equal to 30.
</path>
<path>
2: substituting θ=90° into the equation θ - (180/π)sinθ = 30 yields 90 - (180/π)sin(90°). the value of sin(90°) is 1, so the expression becomes 90 - (180/π). this is approximately 90 - 57.32, which is about 32.68. this result is greater than 30.
</path>
<path>
3: the equation is evaluated for θ=120°. the term (180/π)sin(120°) is approximately (57.2958)(0.8660), which is about 49.63. this value is subtracted from 120, yielding 120 - 49.63 = 70.37. this result (70.37) is greater than the required 30.
</path>
<path>
4: for θ=150°, the value of sinθ is sin(150°) = 0.5. substituting θ=150° into the left side of the equation results in 150 - (180/π) * 0.5. the term (180/π) * 0.5 is approximately 28.6479. the left side of the equation is approximately 150 - 28.6479, which is about 121.3521. this value is not equal to the right side, 30.
</path>
<path>
5: for θ=180°, the left side of the equation θ - (180/π)sinθ is 180 - (180/π)sin(180°) = 180 - 0 = 180, which does not equal the right side of 30.
</path>

the equation θ - (180/π)sinθ = 30 is not satisfied for θ values of 60°, 90°, 120°, 150°, or 180°.

wait, perhaps 100 degrees.
let me try θ=100°.
so, θ - (180/π) sinθ ≈ 100 - 57.2958 * sin(100°).
first, sin(100°) ≈ 0.9848.
so, 57.2958 * 0.9848 ≈ 56.46.
then, 100 - 56.46 ≈ 43.54, which is still bigger than 30.
how about θ=130°: sin(130°)=sin(50°)≈0.7660.
then, (180/π)*0.7660≈57.2958*0.7660≈43.74.
so, 130 - 43.74≈86.26≠30.
hmm.
maybe θ=210°: but that's a reflex angle.
wait, the problem says "the smaller angle ∠adc".
so, θ is acute or maybe obtuse?
let's see.
wait, the shaded area is 5/12 of the larger circle, which is about 5/12 of 12.566≈5.233.
so, around 5.233 is the area.
if we go back to the original equation: (πθ)/72 - (5/2)sinθ = 5π/12 ≈ 5*3.1416/12 ≈1.31.
wait, wait.
wait, the shaded area is (πθ)/72 - (5/2)sinθ =5π/12≈5.233.
wait, that conflicts with my previous calculation.
wait, no.
wait, (πθ)/72 - (5/2)sinθ=5π/12.
multiply both sides by 72: πθ - 180 sinθ=30π≈94.248.
so, equation is θ - (180/π) sinθ=30.
so, when i plug in θ=60: 60 - 57.2958* sin60≈60 - 57.2958*0.8660≈60 - 49.63≈10.37≠30.
not 30.
so, θ needs to be larger.
let's try θ=120: 120 - 57.2958* sin120≈120 - 57.2958*0.8660≈120 - 49.63≈70.37.
still too big.
θ=90:90 -57.2958*1=90-57.2958≈32.70>30.
close.
let me try θ=85.
compute sin(85°).
sin(85)≈0.9962.
so, θ - (180/π) sinθ ≈85 -57.2958*0.9962≈85 -57.05≈27.95.
close to 30, but a bit low.
θ=86: sin(86)≈0.9976.
so, 86 -57.2958*0.9976≈86 -57.13≈28.87.
still low.
θ=87: sin(87)≈0.9989.
87 -57.2958*0.9989≈87 -57.19≈29.81.
close, still a bit less than 30.
θ=87.5: sin(87.5)=sin(87.5°)≈sin(π/2 - π/48)=cos(π/48)≈0.998 approx.
wait, more precise: using calculator, sin(87.5)≈0.9978.
so, 87.5 -57.2958*0.9978≈87.5 -57.13≈30.37.
slightly over 30.
so between θ=87 and 87.5.
let's do linear approximation.
at θ=87, value is 29.81.
at θ=87.5, value is approx 30.37.
so, the change is 0.5 theta gives change in value from 29.81 to 30.37, so a change of 0.56.
we need to reach 30.
so, from 87 to 87.5 is 0.5 degrees, the function increases by 0.56.
we need to go up by 0.19 (from 29.81 to 30).
so, delta_theta≈0.5 *0.19 /0.56≈0.16.
so, approximate solution at 87 +0.16≈87.16 degrees.
but maybe more accurate calculation.
alternatively, use newton-raphson.
let f(θ)=θ - (180/π) sinθ -30.
we need to solve f(θ)=0.
let's think in parallel.

<path>
1: for θ=87.15°, the value of f(θ) is calculated as 87.15 - (180/π) * sin(87.15°) - 30, which simplifies to 87.15 - 57.2958 * 0.9978 - 30. this calculation yields an approximate value of 87.15 - 57.14 - 30, which is about 87.15 - 87.14, or approximately 0.01.
</path>
<path>
2: the function f(θ) is evaluated at θ=87.16°. the term (180/π)sin(87.16°) is approximately 57.2958 * 0.9977, which is about 57.137. the value of f(87.16°) is approximately 87.16° - 57.137, yielding 30.023.
</path>
<conclusion>
the value of f(θ) is approximately 0.01 at θ=87.15° and approximately 0.023 at θ=87.16°.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
so, very close.
thus, θ≈87.15 degrees.
but the problem asks for an exact answer?
wait, the problem says "how many degrees are in the measure of (the smaller) ∠adc?"
wait, but 87.15 degrees is not a standard angle.
however, perhaps there's an exact solution i missed.
wait, maybe my model is wrong.
wait, going back, is the shaded area indeed the sum of the two segments?
or is it the annular sector minus the triangle once?
wait, perhaps i need to think of the shaded area as the area between the two circles from angle 0 to theta.
wait, imagine the two circles, radius 1 and 2, centered at d.
then, if you have a sector of angle theta in both circles, the area between those sectors (annular sector) is the difference of the two sectors.
but in this problem, the diagram shows shading between the two circles from the chord ac, which might correspond to angle theta.
so, the area of the annular
