Okay, let me try to figure out this problem step by step.
So, we have two circles with the same center D.
The smaller circle has a radius of 1, and the larger one has a radius of 2.
There's a shaded region whose total area is 5/12 of the area of the larger circle.
We need to find the measure of angle ADC, which is the smaller angle between points A, D, and C.
Looking at the diagram, it seems like there are two shaded regions: one is a sector-like area in the larger circle, and the other is in the smaller circle.
But I need to confirm exactly what regions are shaded and how they relate to angle ADC.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: Determine the area of the larger circle.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: Determine the total area of the shaded regions.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The area of the larger circle is calculated by squaring its radius of 2 and multiplying by π, resulting in an area of 4π.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The area of the larger circle is given by the formula πr², where r is the radius. For the larger circle, the radius is 2, so its area is π(2)² = 4π. The total area of the shaded regions is specified as 5/12 of the area of the larger circle. Therefore, the total shaded area is (5/12) * 4π, which simplifies to (5/3)π.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The area of the larger circle is 4π, and the total area of the shaded regions is (5/3)π.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So, the total shaded area is (5/3)π.
Now, angle ADC is the central angle that subtends the shaded regions in both circles.
Let me recall that the area of a sector of a circle is (θ/360) * πr2, where θ is the central angle in degrees.
Since there are two shaded regions—one in the larger circle and one in the smaller—maybe the total shaded area is the difference between these two sectors?
Wait, looking at the diagram again, it seems like the shaded region in the larger circle is a sector, and the shaded region in the smaller circle is another sector.
But depending on the angle, one could be a major or minor segment.
Wait, but the problem states that the total shaded area is 5/12 of the larger circle.
So it's possible that the shaded regions together make up this fraction.
Let me try to parse the problem statement again.
It says, "the total area of the shaded region is 5/12 of the area of the larger circle."
So all shaded regions combined have an area of (5/12)*4π = (5/3)π.
So we need to find angle ADC such that the sum of the areas of the sectors in both circles (or maybe the difference?) equals (5/3)π.
Wait, but looking at the diagram, it's a bit confusing.
The shaded regions are two separate areas: one is bounded by the larger circle and a line from D to somewhere, and the other is in the smaller circle.
Hmm. Wait, maybe the shaded region is the area between the two circles (annulus) plus a segment from the smaller circle?
Wait, but the problem doesn't specify, so maybe I need to look at the diagram carefully.
Wait, in the diagram, it looks like there is a shaded sector in the larger circle (between two radii) and a shaded sector in the smaller circle (between the same two radii).
But since the angle at D is the same for both sectors, the angle ADC is the same for both.
So the area of the sector in the larger circle is (θ/360)*π*(2)^2 = (θ/360)*4π, and the area of the sector in the smaller circle is (θ/360)*π*(1)^2 = (θ/360)*π.
But the problem says the total shaded area is (5/12) of the larger circle's area, which is (5/12)*4π = (5/3)π.
So perhaps the sum of these two sectors is (5/3)π?
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: Calculate the sum of the areas of the two sectors and compare it to the total shaded area.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: Calculate the difference between the areas of the two sectors and compare it to the total shaded area.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The sum of the areas of the sectors from both circles is (θ/360)*4π + (θ/360)*π, which simplifies to (θ/360)*5π. Equating this sum to the total shaded area (5/3)π yields the equation (θ/360)*5π = (5/3)π. Dividing both sides by 5π gives θ/360 = 1/3, resulting in θ = 120 degrees.
</Path>
<Path>
2: Alternatively, if the shaded region is the area of the larger sector minus the smaller sector, then the area would be (θ/360)*4π - (θ/360)*π = (θ/360)*3π.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
2.1: Calculate the area of the larger sector.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2.2: Calculate the area of the smaller sector.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
2.1: The area of the larger sector is (θ/360) * π * (2)^2, which equals (θ/360) * 4π.
</Path>
<Path>
2.2: The area of the smaller sector is (θ/360) * π * (1)^2 = (θ/360)π.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The area of the larger sector is (θ/360)*4π, and the area of the smaller sector is (θ/360)π.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
The difference between these areas is (θ/360) * 4π - (θ/360)π = (θ/360) * 3π.
If this difference equals the total shaded area, which is (5/3)π, then setting (θ/360) * 3π = (5/3)π gives (θ * 3π) / 360 = (5π) / 3.
Dividing both sides by π results in (3θ)/360 = 5/3, which simplifies to θ/120 = 5/3.
Multiplying both sides by 120 yields θ = (5/3) * 120, which equals 200.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
If the total shaded area is the sum of the two sectors, θ is 120 degrees; if it is the difference between the two sectors, θ is 200 degrees.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
But the problem states that the shaded regions are in both circles, so the total area is the sum of the two sectors.
Wait, but in that case, summing them would give (θ/360)(4π + π) = (θ/360)(5π).
Set equal to (5/3)π:
(θ/360)(5π) = (5/3)π
Multiply both sides:
θ/360 = 1/3
Multiply both sides by 360:
θ = 120°
But if θ is 120°, then each sector's area would be:
- Larger sector: (120/360)*4π = (1/3)*4π = (4/3)π
- Smaller sector: (120/360)*π = (1/3)π
Sum is (4/3)π + (1/3)π = 5/3π, which matches.
But in the diagram, it's not clear if both sectors are shaded.
Let me check.
The diagram shows two shaded regions: one in the larger circle and one in the smaller circle, both between two lines from D.
So yes, both sectors are shaded.
So their total area is 5/3π.
Therefore, adding them gives 5/3π, leading to θ = 120°.
But wait, the problem says "the total area of the shaded region is 5/12 of the area of the larger circle."
Wait, the sum is (5/3)π.
But if the sectors are part of the same angle θ, then the sum would be (θ/360)(4π + π) = (θ/360)(5π).
Set equal to 5/3 π:
(θ/360)(5π) = 5π/3
Divide both sides by 5π:
θ/360 = 1/3
θ = 120°
That seems straightforward.
But then why would the answer be 100°?
Wait, maybe the diagram is different.
Wait, in the problem statement, it says "the total area of the shaded region is 5/12 of the area of the larger circle."
But 5/12 of the larger circle's area is 5/12 * 4π = 5/3 π, so that's correct.
But if θ is 120°, then the sectors add up to 5/3 π.
So that would imply the answer is 120°.
But the problem mentions "the smaller angle of ∠ADC."
Wait, maybe ∠ADC is the central angle of the sectors.
If so, then if θ is 120°, that's the measure.
However, the problem asks for the measure of the smaller ∠ADC.
Wait, 120° is not the smaller angle if you consider the reflex angle.
Because a full circle is 360°, so the reflex angle would be 360° - 120° = 240°.
So the smaller angle is 120°.
Wait, but the problem mentions "the smaller angle ∠ADC."
Hmm.
Wait, maybe I need to check the diagram again.
Maybe the angle in the diagram is an angle of 100°, but without the diagram, it's hard to say.
Wait, but the user provided the Asymptote code for the diagram.
Let me check that.
The Asymptote code specifies:
```angle ADC is set to 100 degrees in the diagram.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: Determine the arc direction for the inner (smaller circle) shaded region.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: Determine the arc direction for the outer (larger circle) shaded region.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The inner shaded region is defined by an arc drawn from point A to point C with center D, using the clockwise (CW) direction.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The outer shaded region is defined by the arc created with the command `path outer = arc(d, c, a, CCW);`, indicating that the arc is drawn counter-clockwise (CCW) from point c to point a.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The inner (smaller circle) shaded region is formed by a clockwise arc, and the outer (larger circle) shaded region is formed by a counter-clockwise arc.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Then the region1 is from a to c via inner and outer arcs.
But the exact way the regions are defined might depend on the具体 parameters.
But in the code, it says:
```real adc = 100;```
Which sets the angle ADC to 100° in the diagram.
But this is just for drawing purposes.
However, in the problem statement, there is no given angle; we are to find the measure of ∠ADC.
So maybe the diagram is drawn with an angle of 100° as an example, but the actual angle needs to be calculated.
So the problem is not referring to the diagram's specific angle but asking us to find it based on the given areas.
Therefore, going back to our previous calculation, if we assume that the shaded regions are the two sectors (one in each circle) with the same central angle θ, then their areas would be (θ/360)*4π and (θ/360)*π.
The sum is (θ/360)*5π.
Set this equal to 5/3 π, leading to θ = 120°.
But since the problem mentions "the smaller angle ∠ADC," maybe 120° is the correct answer.
However, in the problem statement, the diagram's code has angle ADC set to 100, which might be a red herring.
Alternatively, perhaps the shaded regions are segments rather than sectors.
Wait, let's clarify.
A sector is the region bounded by two radii and an arc.
A segment is the region bounded by a chord and an arc.
If the shaded regions are segments, then their areas would be the area of the sector minus the area of the triangle.
But the problem doesn't mention triangles.
Let's look at the diagram code again.
The regions are defined as:
```path region1 = (a--a/2)..inner..(c/2--c)..outer..cycle;```
And
```guide region2 = arc(d, a/2, c/2, CCW)..(c/2--d--a/2)..cycle;```
Hmm, this is a bit complex.
The first region seems to be a closed path starting from A, going to a/2, following the inner arc to c/2, then to C, following the outer arc back to A.
The second region is an arc from a/2 to c/2 (CCW), then back along the lines to D.
This seems like it's creating some lens-shaped regions.
Wait, perhaps the shaded regions are the areas between the two circles, bounded by the angle θ.
That is, the area of the annulus (the region between the two circles) that is subtended by angle θ, plus the area of a sector in the smaller circle.
But the annulus area would be (4π - π) = 3π for the whole circle.
But if we take a sector of angle θ, then the area of that annular sector would be (θ/360)*3π, and then add the sector area of the smaller circle, which is (θ/360)*π, making the total (θ/360)*4π.
Wait, but that's the same as just taking the sector in the larger circle.
So then the total shaded area would be the larger sector, which is (θ/360)*4π.
If this is equal to 5/12 of the larger circle's area (which is 4π), then:
(θ/360)*4π = (5/12)*4π
=> θ/360 = 5/12
=> θ = (5/12)*360 = 150°
Wait, but then why are there two shaded regions in the diagram?
If we take only the annular sector, that would be the area between the two circles, which is a sector of the larger circle minus the sector of the smaller circle.
That area is (4π/360*θ - π/360*θ)*θ = (3π/360)*θ = (θ/120)π.
Setting this equal to 5/3 π:
θ/120 * π = 5/3 π
=> θ/120 = 5/3
=> θ = 5/3 * 120 = 200°
But if the annular sector area (the area between the two circles) is 5/3 π, then θ would be 200°.
But in this case, the total shaded area is just the annular sector, not including the smaller circle's sector.
However, the diagram shows two separate shaded regions: one in the larger circle and one in the smaller circle.
So that's confusing.
Alternatively, perhaps the problem includes both the annular sector and the smaller sector?
Wait, if the total area is the area of the larger sector minus the area of the smaller sector plus the area of the smaller sector, that would just be the area of the larger sector again.
Which would lead back to θ = 150°.
But according to the problem, the total area is 5/12 of the larger circle, so (5/12)*4π = 5/3 π.
Wait, this is getting confusing.
Let's clarify.
There are two circles, radii 1 and 2, same center D.
Points A and C are on the circles such that angle ADC is θ.
The shaded regions are the sectors of both circles bounded by angle θ.
Therefore, the area of the sector in the larger circle is (θ/360)*π*(2)^2 = (θ/360)*4π, and the area of the sector in the smaller circle is (θ/360)*π*(1)^2 = (θ/360)*π.
The total shaded area is the sum of these two sectors: (θ/360)*4π + (θ/360)*π = (θ/360)*5π.
This is given as equal to 5/12 of the larger circle's area, which is (5/12)*4π = 5π/3.
Therefore, (θ/360)*5π = 5π/3.
Simplify:
θ/360 = 1/3
Multiply both sides by 360:
θ = 120°
Therefore, the measure of angle ADC is 120°.
But the problem says "the smaller angle ∠ADC."
Since 120° is less than 180°, it is indeed the smaller angle.
Wait, but if the angle can be measured as the reflex angle, then the reflex angle would be 360° - 120° = 240°.
So the smaller angle is 120°.
Therefore, the answer should be 120°.
But the problem says "the smaller angle of ∠ADC," so maybe confirming that 120° is the smaller angle.
However, since 120° is acute?
No, 120° is an obtuse angle.
Wait, angles between 0° and 180°; the smaller angle between two lines would be the one less than or equal to 180°.
Since 120° is less than 240°, it is the smaller angle.
So the answer is 120°.
But wait, in the problem diagram, the angle is set to 100°.
Maybe that's just the example, but in reality, our calculation shows 120°.
Alternatively, perhaps the user made an error.
Wait, let me check my calculation again.
Total shaded area is sum of two sectors: (θ/360)(4π + π) = (θ/360)(5π) = (5/3)π.
Therefore, θ/360 = (5/3)/5 = 1/3.
Therefore, θ = 120°.
Seems correct.
Alternatively, maybe the sectors are subtracted.
For example, if the shaded area is the larger sector minus the smaller sector.
Then the area would be (4πθ/360 - πθ/360) = 3πθ/360 = πθ/120.
Set this equal to 5π/3:
πθ/120 = 5π/3
=> θ/120 = 5/3
=> θ = 120*5/3 = 200°
But in this case, the shaded region would be the annular sector, which is the area between the two circles.
However, the problem mentions "the total area of the shaded region," and if in the diagram both the annular sector and the smaller sector are shaded, then maybe the total area is the annular sector plus the smaller sector.
Then total area is (4πθ/360 - πθ/360) + πθ/360 = 4πθ/360.
Which is the same as the larger sector.
Then 4πθ/360 = 5π/3 => θ = (5π/3 * 360 / 4π) = (5/3 * 360 /4 ) = (5 * 30)/1 = 150°
But this contradicts our previous result.
Therefore, depending on how the shaded regions are interpreted, you can get different answers.
But according to the problem statement: "two circles, each with center D, have radii of 1 and 2. The total area of the shaded region is 5/12 of the area of the larger circle. How many degrees are in the measure of (the smaller) ∠ADC?"
So "the total area of the shaded region" is the sum of all shaded regions.
If there are two shaded regions, one in each circle, then their areas would be the sum of two sectors.
If they are in the same angle θ, then sum of their areas is (θ/360)(4π + π) = (θ/360)(5π).
Set equal to 5/12 of the larger circle: 5/12 * 4π = 5/3 π.
So (θ/360)(5π) = 5π/3 => θ = 120°.
Therefore, angle ADC is 120°, which is the smaller angle.
But in the Asymptote code, the angle is set to 100°, which perhaps is just an illustrative angle.
Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that both sectors are shaded.
For example, if one sector is shaded and another is not, but that contradicts "total area of the shaded region."
Alternatively, maybe the shaded region is a segment, not a sector.
A segment is the area of the sector minus the triangle.
But the problem does not mention unshaded triangle regions, so if the entire sector is shaded, then it should be the whole sector.
If segments were shaded, we would have to subtract the area of triangles.
But unless the diagram shows that the shaded regions are segments (i.e., bounded by a chord), then we should consider sectors.
Looking back at the Asymptote code for the regions:
Region1 is from A to c, following inner and outer arcs.
Region2 is an arc from a/2 to c/2 and back along lines to D.
This seems like two distinct regions, each bounded by parts of the circles and lines from D.
If angle ADC is θ, then the areas of these regions would be sectors minus triangles, but if the triangles are also shaded, then they are entire sectors.
Since the problem statement says "the total area of the shaded region is 5/12 of the area of the larger circle," which is approximately 5/12 * 12.57 ≈ 5.236.
If the sectors are summed, 120° is 1/3 of the circle, so 1/3 of the larger circle is 4π/3 ≈ 4.188, and 1/3 of the smaller circle is π/3 ≈ 1.047, sum ≈ 5.235, which is roughly 5/12 of the larger circle?
Wait, 5/12 of 4π is 5π/3 ≈ 5.236, which matches the sum of the two sectors.
So this reinforces that the answer is θ = 120°.
Therefore, the measure of angle ADC is 120°.
But the problem says "(the smaller) ∠ADC".
Since 120° is the smaller angle if you consider the reflex angle (360° - 120° = 240°), then yes, 120° is the smaller angle.
So the answer is 120°.
Wait, but another thought: in some contexts, the angle between two points around a center could be considered as the acute angle or obtuse angle.
However, 120° is an obtuse angle.
But since 120° is smaller than 240°, it is considered the smaller angle.
Yes, typically, when they refer to the measure of the angle between two lines, it's the smaller angle unless specified otherwise.
Therefore, 120° is the correct answer here.
Therefore, after careful calculation and consideration of different interpretations, the measure of angle ADC is 120°.
However, in the initial Asymptote code, the angle is set to 100°, but that's likely just the illustration.
So the final answer is 120°.
**Final Answer** 
\boxed{120}
</Think>

Answer: Given two circles with center \( D \), radii 1 and 2, and the total area of the shaded region being \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle, we need to find the measure of \(\angle ADC\).

1. **Calculate the area of the larger circle**:
   \[
   \text{Area of the larger circle} = \pi \times (2)^2 = 4\pi
   \]

2. **Determine the total shaded area**:
   \[
   \text{Total shaded area} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{5\pi}{3}
   \]

3. **Set up the equation for the sum of the areas of the sectors**:
   - The area of the sector in the larger circle (radius 2) is \(\frac{\theta}{360} \times 4\pi\).
   - The area of the sector in the smaller circle (radius 1) is \(\frac{\theta}{360} \times \pi\).
   - The sum of these areas equals the total shaded area:
     \[
     \frac{\theta}{360} \times 4\pi + \frac{\theta}{360} \times \pi = \frac{5\pi}{3}
     \]

4. **Simplify the equation**:
   \[
   \frac{\theta}{360} \times 5\pi = \frac{5\pi}{3}
   \]

5. **Solve for \(\theta\)**:
   \[
   \frac{\theta}{360} = \frac{1}{3} \implies \theta = 120^\circ
   \]

Thus, the measure of the smaller \(\angle ADC\) is \(\boxed{120}\).

<think>
okay, let me try to figure out this problem step by step.
so, we have two circles with the same center d.
the smaller circle has a radius of 1, and the larger one has a radius of 2.
there's a shaded region whose total area is 5/12 of the area of the larger circle.
we need to find the measure of angle adc, which is the smaller angle between points a, d, and c.
looking at the diagram, it seems like there are two shaded regions: one is a sector-like area in the larger circle, and the other is in the smaller circle.
but i need to confirm exactly what regions are shaded and how they relate to angle adc.
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>
<goal>
<outline>
1: determine the area of the larger circle.
</outline>
<outline>
2: determine the total area of the shaded regions.
</outline>
</goal>
<path>
1: the area of the larger circle is calculated by squaring its radius of 2 and multiplying by π, resulting in an area of 4π.
</path>
<path>
2: the area of the larger circle is given by the formula πr², where r is the radius. for the larger circle, the radius is 2, so its area is π(2)² = 4π. the total area of the shaded regions is specified as 5/12 of the area of the larger circle. therefore, the total shaded area is (5/12) * 4π, which simplifies to (5/3)π.
</path>
<conclusion>
the area of the larger circle is 4π, and the total area of the shaded regions is (5/3)π.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
so, the total shaded area is (5/3)π.
now, angle adc is the central angle that subtends the shaded regions in both circles.
let me recall that the area of a sector of a circle is (θ/360) * πr2, where θ is the central angle in degrees.
since there are two shaded regions—one in the larger circle and one in the smaller—maybe the total shaded area is the difference between these two sectors?
wait, looking at the diagram again, it seems like the shaded region in the larger circle is a sector, and the shaded region in the smaller circle is another sector.
but depending on the angle, one could be a major or minor segment.
wait, but the problem states that the total shaded area is 5/12 of the larger circle.
so it's possible that the shaded regions together make up this fraction.
let me try to parse the problem statement again.
it says, "the total area of the shaded region is 5/12 of the area of the larger circle."
so all shaded regions combined have an area of (5/12)*4π = (5/3)π.
so we need to find angle adc such that the sum of the areas of the sectors in both circles (or maybe the difference?) equals (5/3)π.
wait, but looking at the diagram, it's a bit confusing.
the shaded regions are two separate areas: one is bounded by the larger circle and a line from d to somewhere, and the other is in the smaller circle.
hmm. wait, maybe the shaded region is the area between the two circles (annulus) plus a segment from the smaller circle?
wait, but the problem doesn't specify, so maybe i need to look at the diagram carefully.
wait, in the diagram, it looks like there is a shaded sector in the larger circle (between two radii) and a shaded sector in the smaller circle (between the same two radii).
but since the angle at d is the same for both sectors, the angle adc is the same for both.
so the area of the sector in the larger circle is (θ/360)*π*(2)^2 = (θ/360)*4π, and the area of the sector in the smaller circle is (θ/360)*π*(1)^2 = (θ/360)*π.
but the problem says the total shaded area is (5/12) of the larger circle's area, which is (5/12)*4π = (5/3)π.
so perhaps the sum of these two sectors is (5/3)π?
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>
<goal>
<outline>
1: calculate the sum of the areas of the two sectors and compare it to the total shaded area.
</outline>
<outline>
2: calculate the difference between the areas of the two sectors and compare it to the total shaded area.
</outline>
</goal>
<path>
1: the sum of the areas of the sectors from both circles is (θ/360)*4π + (θ/360)*π, which simplifies to (θ/360)*5π. equating this sum to the total shaded area (5/3)π yields the equation (θ/360)*5π = (5/3)π. dividing both sides by 5π gives θ/360 = 1/3, resulting in θ = 120 degrees.
</path>
<path>
2: alternatively, if the shaded region is the area of the larger sector minus the smaller sector, then the area would be (θ/360)*4π - (θ/360)*π = (θ/360)*3π.
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>
<goal>
<outline>
2.1: calculate the area of the larger sector.
</outline>
<outline>
2.2: calculate the area of the smaller sector.
</outline>
</goal>
<path>
2.1: the area of the larger sector is (θ/360) * π * (2)^2, which equals (θ/360) * 4π.
</path>
<path>
2.2: the area of the smaller sector is (θ/360) * π * (1)^2 = (θ/360)π.
</path>
<conclusion>
the area of the larger sector is (θ/360)*4π, and the area of the smaller sector is (θ/360)π.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
the difference between these areas is (θ/360) * 4π - (θ/360)π = (θ/360) * 3π.
if this difference equals the total shaded area, which is (5/3)π, then setting (θ/360) * 3π = (5/3)π gives (θ * 3π) / 360 = (5π) / 3.
dividing both sides by π results in (3θ)/360 = 5/3, which simplifies to θ/120 = 5/3.
multiplying both sides by 120 yields θ = (5/3) * 120, which equals 200.
</path>
<conclusion>
if the total shaded area is the sum of the two sectors, θ is 120 degrees; if it is the difference between the two sectors, θ is 200 degrees.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
but the problem states that the shaded regions are in both circles, so the total area is the sum of the two sectors.
wait, but in that case, summing them would give (θ/360)(4π + π) = (θ/360)(5π).
set equal to (5/3)π:
(θ/360)(5π) = (5/3)π
multiply both sides:
θ/360 = 1/3
multiply both sides by 360:
θ = 120°
but if θ is 120°, then each sector's area would be:
- larger sector: (120/360)*4π = (1/3)*4π = (4/3)π
- smaller sector: (120/360)*π = (1/3)π
sum is (4/3)π + (1/3)π = 5/3π, which matches.
but in the diagram, it's not clear if both sectors are shaded.
let me check.
the diagram shows two shaded regions: one in the larger circle and one in the smaller circle, both between two lines from d.
so yes, both sectors are shaded.
so their total area is 5/3π.
therefore, adding them gives 5/3π, leading to θ = 120°.
but wait, the problem says "the total area of the shaded region is 5/12 of the area of the larger circle."
wait, the sum is (5/3)π.
but if the sectors are part of the same angle θ, then the sum would be (θ/360)(4π + π) = (θ/360)(5π).
set equal to 5/3 π:
(θ/360)(5π) = 5π/3
divide both sides by 5π:
θ/360 = 1/3
θ = 120°
that seems straightforward.
but then why would the answer be 100°?
wait, maybe the diagram is different.
wait, in the problem statement, it says "the total area of the shaded region is 5/12 of the area of the larger circle."
but 5/12 of the larger circle's area is 5/12 * 4π = 5/3 π, so that's correct.
but if θ is 120°, then the sectors add up to 5/3 π.
so that would imply the answer is 120°.
but the problem mentions "the smaller angle of ∠adc."
wait, maybe ∠adc is the central angle of the sectors.
if so, then if θ is 120°, that's the measure.
however, the problem asks for the measure of the smaller ∠adc.
wait, 120° is not the smaller angle if you consider the reflex angle.
because a full circle is 360°, so the reflex angle would be 360° - 120° = 240°.
so the smaller angle is 120°.
wait, but the problem mentions "the smaller angle ∠adc."
hmm.
wait, maybe i need to check the diagram again.
maybe the angle in the diagram is an angle of 100°, but without the diagram, it's hard to say.
wait, but the user provided the asymptote code for the diagram.
let me check that.
the asymptote code specifies:
```angle adc is set to 100 degrees in the diagram.
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>
<goal>
<outline>
1: determine the arc direction for the inner (smaller circle) shaded region.
</outline>
<outline>
2: determine the arc direction for the outer (larger circle) shaded region.
</outline>
</goal>
<path>
1: the inner shaded region is defined by an arc drawn from point a to point c with center d, using the clockwise (cw) direction.
</path>
<path>
2: the outer shaded region is defined by the arc created with the command `path outer = arc(d, c, a, ccw);`, indicating that the arc is drawn counter-clockwise (ccw) from point c to point a.
</path>
<conclusion>
the inner (smaller circle) shaded region is formed by a clockwise arc, and the outer (larger circle) shaded region is formed by a counter-clockwise arc.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
then the region1 is from a to c via inner and outer arcs.
but the exact way the regions are defined might depend on the具体 parameters.
but in the code, it says:
```real adc = 100;```
which sets the angle adc to 100° in the diagram.
but this is just for drawing purposes.
however, in the problem statement, there is no given angle; we are to find the measure of ∠adc.
so maybe the diagram is drawn with an angle of 100° as an example, but the actual angle needs to be calculated.
so the problem is not referring to the diagram's specific angle but asking us to find it based on the given areas.
therefore, going back to our previous calculation, if we assume that the shaded regions are the two sectors (one in each circle) with the same central angle θ, then their areas would be (θ/360)*4π and (θ/360)*π.
the sum is (θ/360)*5π.
set this equal to 5/3 π, leading to θ = 120°.
but since the problem mentions "the smaller angle ∠adc," maybe 120° is the correct answer.
however, in the problem statement, the diagram's code has angle adc set to 100, which might be a red herring.
alternatively, perhaps the shaded regions are segments rather than sectors.
wait, let's clarify.
a sector is the region bounded by two radii and an arc.
a segment is the region bounded by a chord and an arc.
if the shaded regions are segments, then their areas would be the area of the sector minus the area of the triangle.
but the problem doesn't mention triangles.
let's look at the diagram code again.
the regions are defined as:
```path region1 = (a--a/2)..inner..(c/2--c)..outer..cycle;```
and
```guide region2 = arc(d, a/2, c/2, ccw)..(c/2--d--a/2)..cycle;```
hmm, this is a bit complex.
the first region seems to be a closed path starting from a, going to a/2, following the inner arc to c/2, then to c, following the outer arc back to a.
the second region is an arc from a/2 to c/2 (ccw), then back along the lines to d.
this seems like it's creating some lens-shaped regions.
wait, perhaps the shaded regions are the areas between the two circles, bounded by the angle θ.
that is, the area of the annulus (the region between the two circles) that is subtended by angle θ, plus the area of a sector in the smaller circle.
but the annulus area would be (4π - π) = 3π for the whole circle.
but if we take a sector of angle θ, then the area of that annular sector would be (θ/360)*3π, and then add the sector area of the smaller circle, which is (θ/360)*π, making the total (θ/360)*4π.
wait, but that's the same as just taking the sector in the larger circle.
so then the total shaded area would be the larger sector, which is (θ/360)*4π.
if this is equal to 5/12 of the larger circle's area (which is 4π), then:
(θ/360)*4π = (5/12)*4π
=> θ/360 = 5/12
=> θ = (5/12)*360 = 150°
wait, but then why are there two shaded regions in the diagram?
if we take only the annular sector, that would be the area between the two circles, which is a sector of the larger circle minus the sector of the smaller circle.
that area is (4π/360*θ - π/360*θ)*θ = (3π/360)*θ = (θ/120)π.
setting this equal to 5/3 π:
θ/120 * π = 5/3 π
=> θ/120 = 5/3
=> θ = 5/3 * 120 = 200°
but if the annular sector area (the area between the two circles) is 5/3 π, then θ would be 200°.
but in this case, the total shaded area is just the annular sector, not including the smaller circle's sector.
however, the diagram shows two separate shaded regions: one in the larger circle and one in the smaller circle.
so that's confusing.
alternatively, perhaps the problem includes both the annular sector and the smaller sector?
wait, if the total area is the area of the larger sector minus the area of the smaller sector plus the area of the smaller sector, that would just be the area of the larger sector again.
which would lead back to θ = 150°.
but according to the problem, the total area is 5/12 of the larger circle, so (5/12)*4π = 5/3 π.
wait, this is getting confusing.
let's clarify.
there are two circles, radii 1 and 2, same center d.
points a and c are on the circles such that angle adc is θ.
the shaded regions are the sectors of both circles bounded by angle θ.
therefore, the area of the sector in the larger circle is (θ/360)*π*(2)^2 = (θ/360)*4π, and the area of the sector in the smaller circle is (θ/360)*π*(1)^2 = (θ/360)*π.
the total shaded area is the sum of these two sectors: (θ/360)*4π + (θ/360)*π = (θ/360)*5π.
this is given as equal to 5/12 of the larger circle's area, which is (5/12)*4π = 5π/3.
therefore, (θ/360)*5π = 5π/3.
simplify:
θ/360 = 1/3
multiply both sides by 360:
θ = 120°
therefore, the measure of angle adc is 120°.
but the problem says "the smaller angle ∠adc."
since 120° is less than 180°, it is indeed the smaller angle.
wait, but if the angle can be measured as the reflex angle, then the reflex angle would be 360° - 120° = 240°.
so the smaller angle is 120°.
therefore, the answer should be 120°.
but the problem says "the smaller angle of ∠adc," so maybe confirming that 120° is the smaller angle.
however, since 120° is acute?
no, 120° is an obtuse angle.
wait, angles between 0° and 180°; the smaller angle between two lines would be the one less than or equal to 180°.
since 120° is less than 240°, it is the smaller angle.
so the answer is 120°.
but wait, in the problem diagram, the angle is set to 100°.
maybe that's just the example, but in reality, our calculation shows 120°.
alternatively, perhaps the user made an error.
wait, let me check my calculation again.
total shaded area is sum of two sectors: (θ/360)(4π + π) = (θ/360)(5π) = (5/3)π.
therefore, θ/360 = (5/3)/5 = 1/3.
therefore, θ = 120°.
seems correct.
alternatively, maybe the sectors are subtracted.
for example, if the shaded area is the larger sector minus the smaller sector.
then the area would be (4πθ/360 - πθ/360) = 3πθ/360 = πθ/120.
set this equal to 5π/3:
πθ/120 = 5π/3
=> θ/120 = 5/3
=> θ = 120*5/3 = 200°
but in this case, the shaded region would be the annular sector, which is the area between the two circles.
however, the problem mentions "the total area of the shaded region," and if in the diagram both the annular sector and the smaller sector are shaded, then maybe the total area is the annular sector plus the smaller sector.
then total area is (4πθ/360 - πθ/360) + πθ/360 = 4πθ/360.
which is the same as the larger sector.
then 4πθ/360 = 5π/3 => θ = (5π/3 * 360 / 4π) = (5/3 * 360 /4 ) = (5 * 30)/1 = 150°
but this contradicts our previous result.
therefore, depending on how the shaded regions are interpreted, you can get different answers.
but according to the problem statement: "two circles, each with center d, have radii of 1 and 2. the total area of the shaded region is 5/12 of the area of the larger circle. how many degrees are in the measure of (the smaller) ∠adc?"
so "the total area of the shaded region" is the sum of all shaded regions.
if there are two shaded regions, one in each circle, then their areas would be the sum of two sectors.
if they are in the same angle θ, then sum of their areas is (θ/360)(4π + π) = (θ/360)(5π).
set equal to 5/12 of the larger circle: 5/12 * 4π = 5/3 π.
so (θ/360)(5π) = 5π/3 => θ = 120°.
therefore, angle adc is 120°, which is the smaller angle.
but in the asymptote code, the angle is set to 100°, which perhaps is just an illustrative angle.
alternatively, maybe i made a mistake in assuming that both sectors are shaded.
for example, if one sector is shaded and another is not, but that contradicts "total area of the shaded region."
alternatively, maybe the shaded region is a segment, not a sector.
a segment is the area of the sector minus the triangle.
but the problem does not mention unshaded triangle regions, so if the entire sector is shaded, then it should be the whole sector.
if segments were shaded, we would have to subtract the area of triangles.
but unless the diagram shows that the shaded regions are segments (i.e., bounded by a chord), then we should consider sectors.
looking back at the asymptote code for the regions:
region1 is from a to c, following inner and outer arcs.
region2 is an arc from a/2 to c/2 and back along lines to d.
this seems like two distinct regions, each bounded by parts of the circles and lines from d.
if angle adc is θ, then the areas of these regions would be sectors minus triangles, but if the triangles are also shaded, then they are entire sectors.
since the problem statement says "the total area of the shaded region is 5/12 of the area of the larger circle," which is approximately 5/12 * 12.57 ≈ 5.236.
if the sectors are summed, 120° is 1/3 of the circle, so 1/3 of the larger circle is 4π/3 ≈ 4.188, and 1/3 of the smaller circle is π/3 ≈ 1.047, sum ≈ 5.235, which is roughly 5/12 of the larger circle?
wait, 5/12 of 4π is 5π/3 ≈ 5.236, which matches the sum of the two sectors.
so this reinforces that the answer is θ = 120°.
therefore, the measure of angle adc is 120°.
but the problem says "(the smaller) ∠adc".
since 120° is the smaller angle if you consider the reflex angle (360° - 120° = 240°), then yes, 120° is the smaller angle.
so the answer is 120°.
wait, but another thought: in some contexts, the angle between two points around a center could be considered as the acute angle or obtuse angle.
however, 120° is an obtuse angle.
but since 120° is smaller than 240°, it is considered the smaller angle.
yes, typically, when they refer to the measure of the angle between two lines, it's the smaller angle unless specified otherwise.
therefore, 120° is the correct answer here.
therefore, after careful calculation and consideration of different interpretations, the measure of angle adc is 120°.
however, in the initial asymptote code, the angle is set to 100°, but that's likely just the illustration.
so the final answer is 120°.
**final answer** 
\boxed{120}
</think>

answer: given two circles with center \( d \), radii 1 and 2, and the total area of the shaded region being \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle, we need to find the measure of \(\angle adc\).

1. **calculate the area of the larger circle**:
   \[
   \text{area of the larger circle} = \pi \times (2)^2 = 4\pi
   \]

2. **determine the total shaded area**:
   \[
   \text{total shaded area} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{5\pi}{3}
   \]

3. **set up the equation for the sum of the areas of the sectors**:
   - the area of the sector in the larger circle (radius 2) is \(\frac{\theta}{360} \times 4\pi\).
   - the area of the sector in the smaller circle (radius 1) is \(\frac{\theta}{360} \times \pi\).
   - the sum of these areas equals the total shaded area:
     \[
     \frac{\theta}{360} \times 4\pi + \frac{\theta}{360} \times \pi = \frac{5\pi}{3}
     \]

4. **simplify the equation**:
   \[
   \frac{\theta}{360} \times 5\pi = \frac{5\pi}{3}
   \]

5. **solve for \(\theta\)**:
   \[
   \frac{\theta}{360} = \frac{1}{3} \implies \theta = 120^\circ
   \]

thus, the measure of the smaller \(\angle adc\) is \(\boxed{120}\)
