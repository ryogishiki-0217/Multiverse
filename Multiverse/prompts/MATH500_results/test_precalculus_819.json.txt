Okay, so I have this math problem here about cylindrical coordinates. The question is asking what shape is described by the equation \( z = c \) where \( c \) is a constant. The options are line, circle, plane, sphere, cylinder, or cone. I need to pick the correct one.
First, I should remember what cylindrical coordinates are. I think in cylindrical coordinates, a point in 3D space is described by \( (r, \theta, z) \). Here, \( r \) is the radial distance from the z-axis, \( \theta \) is the angular position from the positive x-axis in the xy-plane, and \( z \) is the height above or below the xy-plane. So, similar to polar coordinates but extended to 3D with the z-coordinate added.
Now, the equation given is \( z = c \). Let me think. In Cartesian coordinates, if you have \( z = c \), that's a horizontal plane right? Because it's all the points at a fixed height z=c. But what's the equivalent in cylindrical coordinates?
Wait, in cylindrical coordinates, z is the same as in Cartesian coordinates. So even if r and θ vary, z is fixed. So if r and θ can be anything, but z is fixed at c, then that's similar to taking all points in space with z-coordinate equal to c, which forms a plane. So the answer would be (C) Plane.
But wait, let me make sure. Let's convert the equation \( z = c \) to Cartesian coordinates. Since z is the same in both cylindrical and Cartesian coordinates, so the equation remains \( z = c \). Which is indeed a plane. So that's straightforward.
But maybe the question is a trick one? Because sometimes in different coordinate systems, equations can represent different things. But I don't think so here. If z is constant, regardless of how r and θ vary, it's still a plane. So I think the answer is (C) Plane.
Wait, let me check the other options to see if any might apply.
(A) Line: A line is one-dimensional. In 3D space, a line would be defined by two equations, right? Like the intersection of two planes. If z = c were a line, we'd need another equation, but here we only have z = c, which is a plane. So no, line is not correct.
(B) Circle: A circle in cylindrical coordinates would typically be something like r = constant, with θ varying from 0 to 2π, and maybe z fixed. But if z is fixed and r and θ vary, that's a plane. If only r is constant, then that's a circle. So if the equation was r = c, then it would be a circle. But here it's z = c, so that's different. So (B) is not correct.
(C) Plane: Yeah, as reasoned before.
(D) Sphere: A sphere would require something like r2 + z2 = c2, but in cylindrical coordinates, that would be more complicated. Wait, a sphere of radius c centered at the origin would be \( r^2 + z^2 = c^2 \). So if z = c, that's not a sphere. So (D) is incorrect.
(E) Cylinder: A cylinder, like the equation r = c, that would hold. Because if r (the distance from the z-axis) is constant, then you get a cylinder. But here z is the constant, so that's different. If z is constant and r varies, it's a plane; if r is constant and z varies, it's a cylinder. Wait, if we have r = c, that's a cylinder. For example, in cylindrical coordinates, r = c is a cylinder around the z-axis with radius c. So cylinder would be (E). But our equation is z = c, so that's different. So (E) is not correct here.
(F) Cone: A cone is typically something like z = c*r, where r is proportional to z. For example, z = r is a cone with angle 45 degrees. So if z is a constant multiple of r, that's a cone. So if the equation was z = c*r, then it would be a cone. But here it's just z = c, so no, it's not a cone.
So going back, z = c in cylindrical coordinates is equivalent to z = c in Cartesian coordinates, which is a plane. So the answer is (C). I need to make sure that none of the other options fit. Let's think again.
If z is a constant, does that describe any of the other shapes? For example, a line—no, because a line would require two coordinates to be fixed, but here only z is fixed; r and θ can vary, which allows movement in the x and y directions, so it's a plane. A circle would fix z and r, but here r isn't fixed. A cylinder fixes r but allows z to vary; here z is fixed and r can vary. Sphere fixes the distance from the origin; cone relates z to r. So none of those are correct.
Therefore, the answer is (C).

Answer: In cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\), the equation \(z = c\) where \(c\) is a constant describes a plane. This is because the \(z\)-coordinate represents the height above or below the xy-plane, and fixing \(z\) to a constant value results in all points in space with that specific height, which forms a horizontal plane. Converting this equation to Cartesian coordinates further confirms that \(z = c\) remains a plane. Therefore, the correct answer is:

the final answer is (C) Plane.
