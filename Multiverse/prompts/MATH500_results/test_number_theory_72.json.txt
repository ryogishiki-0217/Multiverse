Okay, so I need to figure out what the fifth positive integer with exactly three positive divisors is when they're listed in ascending order. Hmm, okay. Let's start by understanding the problem. The question is asking about numbers that have exactly three positive divisors. These numbers must be the ones that when you list all their divisors, there are only three of them. Since we are talking about positive integers, we're dealing with numbers starting from 1 upwards.
First, let's recall that in general, the number of divisors of a number can be determined from its prime factorization. If a number n can be written as the product of primes raised to exponents, like n = p1^a1 * p2^a2 * ... * p_k^a_k, then the number of divisors of n is (a1 + 1)*(a2 + 1)*...*(a_k + 1). For example, take the number 12. Its prime factorization is 2^2 * 3^1. So the number of divisors is (2+1)*(1+1) = 6, which is correct: 1,2,3,4,6,12.
So, if we have a number with exactly three divisors, then the product of one more than each exponent in its prime factorization must be 3. So, how can we get 3 as the product of (exponents + 1)? Since 3 is a prime number, the only way to factor it as a product of integers greater than 1 is just 3 itself. That means that the number must have a single prime factor raised to the power of 2. Because then the exponents plus one would be 2 + 1 = 3. So, numbers of the form p^2, where p is a prime number, will have exactly three divisors: 1, p, and p^2.
Wait, let me verify that. Take p as 2, a prime. Then p^2 is 4. The divisors of 4 are 1, 2, and 4. That's three divisors. Correct. Similarly, if p is 3, p^2 is 9. Divisors of 9 are 1, 3, 9. Again three divisors. Similarly, 5^2 is 25, divisors 1,5,25. Yep, so numbers with exactly three divisors are squares of primes. So the numbers in the list would be 22,32,52,72,112,... and so on, each corresponding to the square of a prime number. Therefore, listing them in ascending order is equivalent to taking the squares of primes in order because squaring primes will give unique numbers here. Since primes themselves are listed in ascending order as 2,3,5,7,11,13, etc., their squares will also be in ascending order: 4,9,25,49,121,169, etc.
Therefore, the problem is essentially asking for the fifth prime number squared. Let's check: First prime is 2, squared is 4. Second prime is 3, squared is 9. Third prime is 5, squared is 25. Fourth prime is 7, squared is 49. Fifth prime is 11, squared is 121. So, the fifth number listed would be 112, which is 121. But let me confirm this step by step. First, list primes in order: 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,...
Then their squares: 4,9,25,49,121,169,289,...
So indeed, the fifth squared number is 112=121. Wait, but hold on, is that right? Let's count again. First: 22=4 (first) 32=9 (second) 52=25 (third) 72=49 (fourth) 112=121 (fifth) Yes, that's correct. So the fifth number is 121. But to make sure, let me think if there's another type of number that might have exactly three divisors. Could a number with more than one distinct prime factor have exactly three divisors? Let's see. Suppose a number is p*q, where p and q are distinct primes. Then the number of divisors would be (1+1)(1+1)=4, which is too many. If a number is p^2*q, then divisors would be (2+1)(1+1)=6, which is also more. So the only way to have exactly three divisors is if the number is the square of a prime. Okay, so that seems confirmed.
Therefore, the numbers with exactly three divisors are the squares of primes. So listing them in order: 4,9,25,49,121,169,... So the fifth one is 121. Therefore, the answer should be 121.
Wait, but just to be thorough, let me list them again step by step: First prime: 2. Square: 4. Second prime:3. Square:9. Third prime:5. Square:25. Fourth prime:7. Square:49. Fifth prime:11. Square:121. Yes, that's 121. So the fifth number is 121. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering 1 as a number with one divisor, but 1 is not a positive integer with exactly three divisors, so that's irrelevant here. The numbers are starting from 4. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake and meant something else, but the problem says "positive integers with exactly three divisors," so correct interpretation is squares of primes. So, the fifth such number should correspond to the fifth prime. Let's list the primes again: 1. 2 2. 3 3. 5 4. 7 5. 11 So yes, fifth prime is 11, square is 121. Therefore, the answer is 121. I think that's right. Wait, but to double-check, let me consider whether any composite numbers (non-prime squares) could have three divisors. The divisor function is multiplicative, so if a number is composite, say with prime factors p and q, then even if p is squared, like p2q, as mentioned before, that would have (2+1)(1+1)=6 divisors. So, more than three. So there's no way a composite number with more than one distinct prime factor can have exactly three divisors. Similarly, if a number is a higher power of a prime, like p^3, then the number of divisors would be 3+1=4. For example, 8 is 2^3, and its divisors are 1,2,4,8. So four divisors. So that doesn't work. Similarly, p^4 would have 4+1=5 divisors. So again, no. Therefore, only squares of primes have exactly three divisors. Therefore, the numbers are squares of primes, ordered as 4,9,25,49,121,..., so the fifth one is 121. So the answer is 121. But another way to approach it is to list numbers in order and check their divisors. Let me do that to confirm. Start from n=1 upwards, check how many divisors each number has, and collect those with exactly three divisors. Let's do that:
n=1: divisors: 1. Count:1
n=2: divisors:1,2. Count:2
n=3: divisors:1,3. Count:2
n=4: divisors:1,2,4. Count:3. So this is the first number with three divisors. It's 4.
n=5: divisors:1,5. Count:2
n=6: divisors:1,2,3,6. Count:4
n=7: divisors:1,7. Count:2
n=8: divisors:1,2,4,8. Count:4
n=9: divisors:1,3,9. Count:3. Second number with three divisors:9
n=10: divisors:1,2,5,10. Count:4
n=11: divisors:1,11. Count:2
n=12: divisors:1,2,3,4,6,12. Count:6
n=13: divisors:1,13. Count:2
n=14: divisors:1,2,7,14. Count:4
n=15: divisors:1,3,5,15. Count:4
n=16: divisors:1,2,4,8,16. Count:5
n=17: divisors:1,17. Count:2
n=18: divisors:1,2,3,6,9,18. Count:6
n=19: divisors:1,19. Count:2
n=20: divisors:1,2,4,5,10,20. Count:6
n=21: divisors:1,3,7,21. Count:4
n=22: divisors:1,2,11,22. Count:4
n=23: divisors:1,23. Count:2
n=24: divisors:1,2,3,4,6,8,12,24. Count:8
n=25: divisors:1,5,25. Count:3. This is the third number with three divisors:25
n=26: divisors:1,2,13,26. Count:4
n=27: divisors:1,3,9,27. Count:4
n=28: divisors:1,2,4,7,14,28. Count:6
n=30: divisors:1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30. Count:8
Wait, but in between, we might have missed some? Let me check up to, say, 50. Wait, but 25 is 5 squared, which is prime, so that's the third. Let's see: After 25, next square of prime is 72=49.
So let's check numbers up to 50. Continuing:
n=32: divisors:1,2,4,8,16,32. Count:6
n=34: divisors:1,2,17,34. Count:4
n=35: divisors:1,5,7,35. Count:4
n=36: divisors:1,2,3,4,6,9,12,18,36. Count:9
n=37: divisors:1,37. Count:2
n=38: divisors:1,2,19,38. Count:4
n=39: divisors:1,3,13,39. Count:4
n=40: divisors:1,2,4,5,8,10,20,40. Count:8
n=41: divisors:1,41. Count:2
n=42: divisors:1,2,3,6,7,14,21,42. Count:8
n=43: divisors:1,43. Count:2
n=44: divisors:1,2,4,11,22,44. Count:6
n=45: divisors:1,3,5,9,15,45. Count:6
n=46: divisors:1,2,23,46. Count:4
n=47: divisors:1,47. Count:2
n=48: divisors:1,2,3,4,6,8,12,16,24,48. Count:10
n=49: divisors:1,7,49. Count:3. Fourth number with three divisors:49
n=50: divisors:1,2,5,10,25,50. Count:6
So up to 50, the numbers with three divisors are 4,9,25,49. So the next one after 49 is? The next prime is 11, so 121. Which is above 50. So let's check 121. Indeed, 10 squared is 100, which is not a prime square, then 11 squared is 121. So, 121 is the next one. So listing them in order: First:4 (22) Second:9 (32) Third:25 (52) Fourth:49 (72) Fifth:121 (112) So yes, the fifth one is 121. Therefore, the answer is 121. But just to be 100% sure, maybe there's some number between 49 and 121 that has exactly three divisors. But between 49 (72) and 121 (112), the next prime is 11, so 112 is the next such number. There are no primes between 7 and 11. The primes after 2,3,5,7 are 11,13,... So yes, after 7, it's 11. Therefore, their squares would be 112=121, 132=169, etc. So, the numbers with three divisors are indeed the squares of primes in order. So the fifth such number is 112=121. So the answer is 121. Therefore, confident that the answer is 121.

The fifth positive integer with exactly three divisors is found by identifying numbers of the form \( p^2 \), where \( p \) is a prime number. These numbers have divisors 1, \( p \), and \( p^2 \). The first five primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11. Squaring these primes gives the numbers with exactly three divisors: 4, 9, 25, 49, and 121. Therefore, the fifth number in this sequence is 121.

okay, so i need to figure out what the fifth positive integer with exactly three positive divisors is when they're listed in ascending order. hmm, okay. let's start by understanding the problem. the question is asking about numbers that have exactly three positive divisors. these numbers must be the ones that when you list all their divisors, there are only three of them. since we are talking about positive integers, we're dealing with numbers starting from 1 upwards.
first, let's recall that in general, the number of divisors of a number can be determined from its prime factorization. if a number n can be written as the product of primes raised to exponents, like n = p1^a1 * p2^a2 * ... * p_k^a_k, then the number of divisors of n is (a1 + 1)*(a2 + 1)*...*(a_k + 1). for example, take the number 12. its prime factorization is 2^2 * 3^1. so the number of divisors is (2+1)*(1+1) = 6, which is correct: 1,2,3,4,6,12.
so, if we have a number with exactly three divisors, then the product of one more than each exponent in its prime factorization must be 3. so, how can we get 3 as the product of (exponents + 1)? since 3 is a prime number, the only way to factor it as a product of integers greater than 1 is just 3 itself. that means that the number must have a single prime factor raised to the power of 2. because then the exponents plus one would be 2 + 1 = 3. so, numbers of the form p^2, where p is a prime number, will have exactly three divisors: 1, p, and p^2.
wait, let me verify that. take p as 2, a prime. then p^2 is 4. the divisors of 4 are 1, 2, and 4. that's three divisors. correct. similarly, if p is 3, p^2 is 9. divisors of 9 are 1, 3, 9. again three divisors. similarly, 5^2 is 25, divisors 1,5,25. yep, so numbers with exactly three divisors are squares of primes. so the numbers in the list would be 22,32,52,72,112,... and so on, each corresponding to the square of a prime number. therefore, listing them in ascending order is equivalent to taking the squares of primes in order because squaring primes will give unique numbers here. since primes themselves are listed in ascending order as 2,3,5,7,11,13, etc., their squares will also be in ascending order: 4,9,25,49,121,169, etc.
therefore, the problem is essentially asking for the fifth prime number squared. let's check: first prime is 2, squared is 4. second prime is 3, squared is 9. third prime is 5, squared is 25. fourth prime is 7, squared is 49. fifth prime is 11, squared is 121. so, the fifth number listed would be 112, which is 121. but let me confirm this step by step. first, list primes in order: 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,...
then their squares: 4,9,25,49,121,169,289,...
so indeed, the fifth squared number is 112=121. wait, but hold on, is that right? let's count again. first: 22=4 (first) 32=9 (second) 52=25 (third) 72=49 (fourth) 112=121 (fifth) yes, that's correct. so the fifth number is 121. but to make sure, let me think if there's another type of number that might have exactly three divisors. could a number with more than one distinct prime factor have exactly three divisors? let's see. suppose a number is p*q, where p and q are distinct primes. then the number of divisors would be (1+1)(1+1)=4, which is too many. if a number is p^2*q, then divisors would be (2+1)(1+1)=6, which is also more. so the only way to have exactly three divisors is if the number is the square of a prime. okay, so that seems confirmed.
therefore, the numbers with exactly three divisors are the squares of primes. so listing them in order: 4,9,25,49,121,169,... so the fifth one is 121. therefore, the answer should be 121.
wait, but just to be thorough, let me list them again step by step: first prime: 2. square: 4. second prime:3. square:9. third prime:5. square:25. fourth prime:7. square:49. fifth prime:11. square:121. yes, that's 121. so the fifth number is 121. alternatively, maybe the question is considering 1 as a number with one divisor, but 1 is not a positive integer with exactly three divisors, so that's irrelevant here. the numbers are starting from 4. alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake and meant something else, but the problem says "positive integers with exactly three divisors," so correct interpretation is squares of primes. so, the fifth such number should correspond to the fifth prime. let's list the primes again: 1. 2 2. 3 3. 5 4. 7 5. 11 so yes, fifth prime is 11, square is 121. therefore, the answer is 121. i think that's right. wait, but to double-check, let me consider whether any composite numbers (non-prime squares) could have three divisors. the divisor function is multiplicative, so if a number is composite, say with prime factors p and q, then even if p is squared, like p2q, as mentioned before, that would have (2+1)(1+1)=6 divisors. so, more than three. so there's no way a composite number with more than one distinct prime factor can have exactly three divisors. similarly, if a number is a higher power of a prime, like p^3, then the number of divisors would be 3+1=4. for example, 8 is 2^3, and its divisors are 1,2,4,8. so four divisors. so that doesn't work. similarly, p^4 would have 4+1=5 divisors. so again, no. therefore, only squares of primes have exactly three divisors. therefore, the numbers are squares of primes, ordered as 4,9,25,49,121,..., so the fifth one is 121. so the answer is 121. but another way to approach it is to list numbers in order and check their divisors. let me do that to confirm. start from n=1 upwards, check how many divisors each number has, and collect those with exactly three divisors. let's do that:

n=27: divisors:1,3,9,27. count:4
n=28: divisors:1,2,4,7,14,28. count:6
n=30: divisors:1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30. count:8
wait, but in between, we might have missed some? let me check up to, say, 50. wait, but 25 is 5 squared, which is prime, so that's the third. let's see: after 25, next square of prime is 72=49.
so let's check numbers up to 50. continuing:
n=32: divisors:1,2,4,8,16,32. count:6
n=34: divisors:1,2,17,34. count:4
n=35: divisors:1,5,7,35. count:4

n=38: divisors:1,2,19,38. count:4
n=39: divisors:1,3,13,39. count:4
n=40: divisors:1,2,4,5,8,10,20,40. count:8
n=41: divisors:1,41. count:2
n=42: divisors:1,2,3,6,7,14,21,42. count:8
n=43: divisors:1,43. count:2
n=44: divisors:1,2,4,11,22,44. count:6
n=45: divisors:1,3,5,9,15,45. count:6
n=46: divisors:1,2,23,46. count:4
n=47: divisors:1,47. count:2
n=48: divisors:1,2,3,4,6,8,12,16,24,48. count:10
n=49: divisors:1,7,49. count:3. fourth number with three divisors:49
n=50: divisors:1,2,5,10,25,50. count:6
so up to 50, the numbers with three divisors are 4,9,25,49. so the next one after 49 is? the next prime is 11, so 121. which is above 50. so let's check 121. indeed, 10 squared is 100, which is not a prime square, then 11 squared is 121. so, 121 is the next one. so listing them in order: first:4 (22) second:9 (32) third:25 (52) fourth:49 (72) fifth:121 (112) so yes, the fifth one is 121. therefore, the answer is 121. but just to be 100% sure, maybe there's some number between 49 and 121 that has exactly three divisors. but between 49 (72) and 121 (112), the next prime is 11, so 112 is the next such number. there are no primes between 7 and 11. the primes after 2,3,5,7 are 11,13,... so yes, after 7, it's 11. therefore, their squares would be 112=121, 132=169, etc. so, the numbers with three divisors are indeed the squares of primes in order. so the fifth such number is 112=121. so the answer is 121. therefore, confident that the answer is 121.

the fifth positive integer with exactly three divisors is found by identifying numbers of the form \( p^2 \), where \( p \) is a prime number. these numbers have divisors 1, \( p \), and \( p^2 \). the first five primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11. squaring these primes gives the numbers with exactly three divisors: 4, 9, 25, 49, and 121. therefore, the fifth number in this sequence is 121.
