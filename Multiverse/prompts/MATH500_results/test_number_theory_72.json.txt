Okay, so I need to find the fifth positive integer with exactly three positive divisors, listed in ascending order. Hmm, let me think.
First, I remember that the number of divisors of a number can be determined from its prime factorization.
If a number n can be written as p1^a1 * p2^a2 * ... * p_k^a_k, where p1, p2, ..., p_k are distinct primes, then the number of divisors is (a1 + 1)(a2 + 1)...(a_k + 1). Right?
So, if a number has exactly three divisors, then the product of these terms must be 3.
Since 3 is a prime number, the only way to factor it as a product is 3 = 3 * 1 (or just 3, but since we have multiple exponents, it's 3 and the rest 1s).
That means the number must be of the form p^2, where p is a prime number.
Because if you have p^2, then the number of divisors is 2 + 1 = 3.
The divisors would be 1, p, and p^2.
For example, take p = 2, which is prime.
Then p^2 = 4.
The divisors of 4 are 1, 2, and 4.
Exactly three.
Similarly, if p = 3, then p^2 = 9, and divisors are 1, 3, 9.
Again three.
So, numbers with exactly three divisors are squares of primes.
Therefore, listing them in ascending order would be the squares of prime numbers in ascending order.
So the first such number is 22 = 4, then 32 = 9, 52 = 25, 72 = 49, next is 112 = 121, and so on.
Wait, primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, etc.
So their squares would be 4, 9, 25, 49, 121, 169, etc.
Therefore, the fifth number with exactly three divisors is the square of the fifth prime.
Let me check the order again.
First prime is 2 (prime), square is 4 (first number).
Third is 5, square 25; fourth, 7, square 49; fifth prime is 11, square 121; sixth prime 13, square 169.
Therefore, the fifth number in the list would be 121.
Wait, let me count them again to make sure.
Let's list them in order: 4, 9, 25, 49, 121,...
So the first five numbers.
Let me verify each:
- 4 = 22, divisors: 1, 2, 4 (3 divisors)
- 9 = 32: 1, 3, 9 (3)
- 25 = 52: 1,5,25 (3)
- 49 =72: 1,7,49 (3)
- 121 =112: 1,11,121 (3)
Yes, each of these numbers has exactly three divisors.
So the fifth one is 121.
But wait, is that right?
Let me check again.
The primes in order: 2,3,5,7,11,13,...
So the squares: 4,9,25,49,121,169,...
So fifth term is 121.
But the question is phrased as "When the positive integers with exactly three positive divisors are listed in ascending order, what is the fifth number listed?"
Yes, so if they are listed in ascending order, the fifth one is 121.
Wait, but hold on: 4 (1st), 9 (2nd), 25 (third), 49 (fourth), 121 (fifth).
Yes, that seems correct.
But I want to make sure there are no other numbers with three divisors in between.
For example, maybe some composite number that isn't a square of a prime can have exactly three divisors?
But by the divisor rule, the number of divisors is multiplicative over the exponents in the prime factorization increased by one.
So to have exactly three divisors, the number must have exponents such that (a+1) =3, so a=2, and only one prime factor.
Therefore, only squares of primes.
So that's confirmed.
So then, the numbers are exactly the squares of primes.
Therefore, the fifth such number is the square of the fifth prime.
Let's check the primes again: 1st prime is 2, 2nd is 3, 3rd is 5, 4th is 7, 5th is 11.
So 11 squared is 121.
Therefore, the answer is 121.
Wait, but let me verify again.
Suppose someone thinks maybe the number could be a product of two distinct primes, but no, that would be a semiprime, like 6 = 2*3, which has divisors 1,2,3,6: four divisors.
Similarly, if it's a cube, like 8 = 2^3, divisors: 1,2,4,8: four divisors.
So only squares of primes have three divisors.
So 4,9,25,49,121,...
Yes, so in order.
So fifth one is 121.
Wait, just to make sure, are there any other numbers between 49 and 121 that have three divisors?
The next prime after 7 is 11, so 11 squared is 121.
So are there any other numbers with three divisors between 49 and 121?
For example, check numbers like 8, 10, etc. which are not squares of primes.
They have more divisors.
So, no.
The next square of prime after 7^2=49 is 11^2=121.
Because the next prime is 11.
So there's a gap between 49 and 121 where there are no other numbers with three divisors.
Therefore, yes, 121 is the fifth such number.
Wait, let me count once again:
First: 4
Second: 9
Third: 25
Fourth: 49
Fifth:121
Yes, five numbers.
Alternatively, maybe check if there is a prime between 7 and 11, but no.
Next prime after 7 is 11.
So 11 squared is 121.
Therefore, yes, the fifth number is 121.
Alternatively, maybe I miscounted the primes.
Let me check:
Primes in order: 2,3,5,7,11,13,...
So, 2 is first, 3 second, 5 third, 7 fourth, 11 fifth, 13 sixth.
So if we square the fifth prime (11), we get 121.
Therefore, 121 is the fifth such number.
Alternatively, maybe think that the fifth number is the prime squared, and how many primes are there up to 11.
But yeah, list of primes is 2,3,5,7,11.
So fifth one is 11.
Therefore, square is 121.
Alternatively, maybe check with the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS).
But since I can't look it up right now, but I recall that sequence is the squares of primes: A001248.
But in any case, based on logic, 121 is the fifth such number.
Wait, let's think of another way.
Suppose we list all numbers with exactly three divisors.
As we agreed, they are squares of primes.
So each such number corresponds to a prime number.
So the first such number corresponds to the first prime (2), second prime (3), third prime (5), etc.
So the nth number in the list is the nth prime squared.
Therefore, the fifth number would be the fifth prime squared, which is 112 = 121.
Therefore, the answer is 121.
I think that's correct.
**Final Answer**
\boxed{121}
</Think>

Answer: To solve the problem of finding the fifth positive integer with exactly three positive divisors listed in ascending order, we start by understanding that a number has exactly three divisors if and only if it is the square of a prime number. This is because the number of divisors of a number \( p^2 \) (where \( p \) is prime) is 3: 1, \( p \), and \( p^2 \).

The primes in ascending order are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, etc. Squaring these primes gives the numbers with exactly three divisors: \( 2^2 = 4 \), \( 3^2 = 9 \), \( 5^2 = 25 \), \( 7^2 = 49 \), \( 11^2 = 121 \), \( 13^2 = 169 \), etc.

Listing these squares in ascending order, we have:
1. 4
2. 9
3. 25
4. 49
5. 121

Thus, the fifth number in this list is \( 11^2 = 121 \).

The final answer is \(\boxed{121}\).

because if you have p^2, then the number of divisors is 2 + 1 = 3.
the divisors would be 1, p, and p^2.
for example, take p = 2, which is prime.
then p^2 = 4.
the divisors of 4 are 1, 2, and 4.
exactly three.
similarly, if p = 3, then p^2 = 9, and divisors are 1, 3, 9.
again three.
so, numbers with exactly three divisors are squares of primes.
therefore, listing them in ascending order would be the squares of prime numbers in ascending order.
so the first such number is 22 = 4, then 32 = 9, 52 = 25, 72 = 49, next is 112 = 121, and so on.

so their squares would be 4, 9, 25, 49, 121, 169, etc.
therefore, the fifth number with exactly three divisors is the square of the fifth prime.
let me check the order again.
first prime is 2 (prime), square is 4 (first number).
third is 5, square 25; fourth, 7, square 49; fifth prime is 11, square 121; sixth prime 13, square 169.
therefore, the fifth number in the list would be 121.

- 49 =72: 1,7,49 (3)
- 121 =112: 1,11,121 (3)
yes, each of these numbers has exactly three divisors.
so the fifth one is 121.
but wait, is that right?
let me check again.
the primes in order: 2,3,5,7,11,13,...

for example, check numbers like 8, 10, etc. which are not squares of primes.
they have more divisors.
so, no.
the next square of prime after 7^2=49 is 11^2=121.
because the next prime is 11.
