Okay, so I need to solve this problem: If n ≡ 2 mod 7, then find the remainder when (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) is divided by 7.
Hmm, let's see. First, the problem says that n is congruent to 2 modulo 7. That means when n is divided by 7, the remainder is 2. So examples of such n would be 2, 9, 16, 23, etc. But instead of picking a specific number, maybe it's easier to work with the congruence directly.
The expression we need to evaluate is (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) mod 7. Since n ≡ 2 mod 7, we can substitute n with 2 in the expression because congruences allow us to replace numbers with their equivalents modulo 7.
Let's think in parallel.

<Conclusion>
The individual components of the expression (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) are evaluated for n ≡ 2 mod 7, yielding (2 + 2) ≡ 4, (2 + 4) ≡ 6, and (2 + 6) ≡ 1 modulo 7.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So the product (4)(6)(1) = 24*1=24. Now, we need to find 24 mod 7. Let's divide 24 by 7: 7*3=21, so 24-21=3. So 24 ≡ 3 mod 7. Therefore, the remainder is 3.
Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. Since n ≡ 2 mod 7, replacing n with 2 in the expression (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) gives (2+2)(2+4)(2+6)=4*6*8= 4*6*8= 192? Then divide 192 by 7. Let's check 7*27=189, so 192-189=3. Yep, remainder is 3. So that works.
But does this method hold in general? Because we replaced n with 2, even though n could be any number congruent to 2 mod7, like 9. Let's test it. Suppose n=9. Then compute (9 +2)(9 +4)(9 +6)=11*13*15. Now, compute this product: 11*13=143, 143*15=2145. Divide 2145 by7. 7*306=2142. 2145-2142=3. Remainder is 3. Same as before.

1: For n=16, the expression (16 + 2)(16 + 4)(16 + 6) evaluates to 18*20*22. The product 18*20 is 360, and 360*22 is 7920. Dividing 7920 by 7 yields 7920 = 7 * 1131 + 3, with a remainder of 3.
</Path>
<Path>
2: For n=23, the expression (23 + 2)(23 + 4)(23 + 6) evaluates to 25*27*29. The product 25*27 is 675. Multiplying 675 by 29 gives 19575. Dividing 19575 by 7 yields 2796 with a remainder of 3, as 7*2796 equals 19572.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The expression (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) evaluated at n=16 and n=23 both yield remainders of 3 when divided by 7.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So same remainder. Therefore, the method is correct. So in general, if n ≡2 mod7, then (n +2), (n +4), (n +6) can be replaced by (2+2), (2+4), (2+6), then compute the product and take mod7.
Alternatively, maybe we could have done the entire calculation modulo7. Let's think again. Since n ≡2 mod7, then:
n +2 ≡2 +2=4 mod7
n +4 ≡2 +4=6 mod7
n +6 ≡2 +6=8 ≡1 mod7
Thus, the product (n +2)(n +4)(n +6) ≡4*6*1 mod7.
4*6=24; 24 mod7 is 3, then 3*1=3. Therefore, the product is 3 mod7. Hence, remainder is 3.
That's a bit more straightforward. So even if we do the substitution step by step, modulo 7, we get the same result. That's good.
Wait, another thought. The problem says "If n ≡2 mod7, then...". So we can work entirely in modulo7 arithmetic. So given n ≡2, so we can substitute right away. But here's another approach: maybe factoring the expression in terms of n. But given the problem, perhaps it's overcomplicating.
Alternatively, let's expand the polynomial (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) and then simplify modulo7. Let me try that.
First, expand (n +2)(n +4)(n+6). Let's do step by step.
First, multiply (n +2)(n +4) = n^2 +4n +2n +8 = n^2 +6n +8.
Then multiply by (n +6): (n^2 +6n +8)(n +6) = n^3 +6n^2 +8n +6n^2 +36n +48.
Combine like terms: n^3 + (6n^2 +6n^2) + (8n +36n) +48 = n^3 +12n^2 +44n +48.
Now, simplify this modulo7. First, reduce the coefficients mod7.

</Parallel>
Therefore, the polynomial simplifies to n^3 +5n^2 +2n +6 mod7.
Since n ≡2 mod7, substitute n=2 into this polynomial:
2^3 +5*(2)^2 +2*(2) +6 = 8 +5*4 +4 +6 =8 +20 +4 +6= 40 +10=50. Then 50 mod7. 7*7=49, so 50-49=1. Wait, so 50 ≡1 mod7. Wait, that's conflicting with the previous answer. Hmm, there must be an error here.
Wait, but earlier approaches gave remainder 3, but polynomial expansion gives 1. That's a problem. Which one is correct? Let's check.
Wait, so let's take n=2. Compute (2+2)(2+4)(2+6)=4*6*8=192. 192 divided by7: 7*27=189, remainder3. But if we plug n=2 into the expanded polynomial: 2^3 +5*(2)^2 +2*(2) +6=8 +20 +4 +6=38+6=44. Then 44 mod7: 7*6=42, remainder2. Wait 44-42=2. Wait, so 44≡2 mod7. But 192≡3 mod7. That's a conflict. So that means somewhere I made a mistake in the expansion process.
Wait, so perhaps when I expanded the polynomial and then reduced modulo7, the error is there. Let me check my expansion again.
Wait, first step: (n +2)(n +4) = n^2 +4n +2n +8 = n^2 +6n +8. That's correct.
Multiply by (n +6): (n^2 +6n +8)(n +6) = n^3 +6n^2 +8n +6n^2 +48n +48. Wait, here may be the mistake.
Wait, when I do (n^2 +6n +8)(n +6), distribute each term:
n^2*n =n^3
n^2*6=6n^2
6n*n=6n^2
6n*6=36n
8*n=8n
8*6=48
So combining like terms:
n^3 + (6n^2 +6n^2) + (36n +8n) +48 =n^3 +12n^2 +44n +48. That seems right. But now, when substituting n=2:
2^3 +12*(2)^2 +44*(2) +48=8 +48 +88 +48= 8+48=56; 56+88=144; 144+48=192. So 192, which is the original expression. Then 192 mod7 is 3. But when I reduced coefficients mod7 first, then substituted n=2, I got 1. So that must mean my coefficient reduction is wrong.
Wait, let's re-express the polynomial n^3 +12n^2 +44n +48 mod7.
First, 12 mod7 is 12-7=5. So 12n^2 becomes5n^2.
44 mod7: 44-6*7=44-42=2. So 44n becomes2n.
48 mod7: 48 -7*6=48-42=6. So constant term is6.
Therefore, polynomial mod7 is n^3 +5n^2 +2n +6. Correct. Now, substitute n=2:
2^3 +5*(2)^2 +2*(2) +6=8 +20 +4 +6=38+6=44. Then 44 mod7 is 2, as 44=6*7 +2. Wait, but 44≡2 mod7, but the actual expression (n +2)(n +4)(n+6) when n=2 is 4*6*8=192. 192 mod7 is 3. So inconsistency here.
Therefore, something is wrong. But how? Wait, perhaps the confusion is arising because expanding the polynomial and then taking mod7 is not equivalent to computing the original product mod7, because modulo operations can't be arbitrarily distributed without remainder theorems.
Wait, no. If we expand the polynomial and then take each coefficient mod7, then set n=2, we should get the same result as evaluating the original expression mod7. But in this case, substituting n=2 into the original expression gives 192, which mod7 is3, but substituting n=2 into the mod7 polynomial gives44, which is2 mod7. Therefore, there must be a miscalculation in either the polynomial evaluation or the original expression.
Wait, let's double-check the original expression for n=2: (2 +2)(2 +4)(2 +6)=4*6*8=192. 192 divided by7: 7*27=189, so remainder3. Correct.
Now, substituting into the mod7 polynomial:
n^3 +5n^2 +2n +6, with n=2:
2^3=8
5*2^2=20
2*2=4
Then total is8+20+4+6=38. 38 mod7 is38-35=3. Wait, so 38≡3 mod7. But 38=5*7 +3, so remainder3. Wait, but earlier I said 44 mod7. Wait, this is confusing. Wait in the previous calculation when substituting n=2 into the expanded polynomial before reducing mod7, we have 2^3 +12*2^2 +44*2 +48=8 +48 +88 +48=29+136=184? Wait, no. Wait, 8 +48=56, 56 +88=144, 144 +48=192. Oh, right. But when we take each term mod7 first:
Wait, n^3 +5n^2 +2n +6. Coefficients are1,5,2,6. So for n=2:
First term: 2^3=8≡1 mod7 (since8-7=1)
Second term:5*(2^2)=5*4=20≡6 mod7 (20-14=6)
Third term:2*(2)=4≡4 mod7
Fourth term:6≡6 mod7.
So adding up 1 +6 +4 +6=17≡3 mod7 (since17-14=3). So actually, it's3. So that's correct. So where did I go wrong before?
Earlier, when I plugged n=2 into the expanded polynomial before reducing mod7, I got192, which is correct, but if I plug into the mod7 reduced polynomial, I should get the same result. Wait, but when I computed the mod7 polynomial with n=2: first term 1, second term6, third term4, fourth term6. Total is1+6+4+6=17≡3 mod7. Which matches 192≡3 mod7. So that works.
But earlier, when I computed 8 +20 +4 +6=38, which is3 mod7 (38≡3 mod7). So why did I previously say 38+6=44? Wait, that was a mistake. Let me check:
Wait, original mod7 polynomial is n^3 +5n^2 +2n +6. So substituting n=2:
2^3=8. 8 mod7=1.
5*(2^2)=5*4=20. 20 mod7=6 (20-14=6).
2*(2)=4. 4 mod7=4.
6 mod7=6.
Then adding these terms:1 +6 +4 +6=17. 17 mod7=3. Correct. So my original mistake was when I thought the total was38+6=44; no, the terms are1 +6 +4 +6=17. So 17 mod7=3. Therefore, both methods agree. So why did I get confused before?
Wait, in the polynomial expansion, after expanding we got n^3 +12n^2 +44n +48. Then when substituting n=2, that's 2^3 +12*2^2 +44*2 +48=8 +48 +88 +48=192. Then mod7 is3. If we first reduce the coefficients modulo7:
12 mod7=5, 44 mod7=2, 48 mod7=6. So polynomial is n^3 +5n^2 +2n +6. Then substituting n=2: 2^3 +5*4 +2*2 +6=8 +20 +4 +6=38. 38 mod7=3. So both are correct. So why was there confusion before? Ah, in my initial test, when I computed the expanded polynomial before reducing mod7 and said that 44 mod7 is2, but 44 is equivalent to 2 mod7, but when we compute the terms, we need to compute each term modulo7.
So if we do 8 +20 +4 +6=38, which is3 mod7. But 38 isn't the same as3, but 38≡3 mod7. So both are correct. So the confusion arose because when we compute the expression as written, we get192≡3, and when we compute the mod7 polynomial, we get38≡3. So all is well.
So why did I get 192 first and then 38? Because 192 is the value of the expanded polynomial before taking mod7, and38 is the value after reducing the coefficients mod7 and then evaluating. But both are consistent. So the process of expanding and then reducing coefficients modulo7 is valid, but one must remember to take each coefficient modulo7 first, then perform the evaluation. So in essence, both approaches are correct, but the first approach (substituting n=2 into the original expression and then calculating the product modulo7) is much simpler and less error-prone.
Therefore, the correct answer is3.
**Final Answer**
the final answer is 3
</Think>

Answer: Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the remainder when \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) is divided by 7.

First, we substitute \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \) into the expression:

\[
(n + 2) \equiv 2 + 2 = 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
(n + 4) \equiv 2 + 4 = 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
(n + 6) \equiv 2 + 6 = 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
\]

Next, we calculate the product of these results modulo 7:

\[
(4)(6)(1) = 24 \pmod{7}
\]

Finally, we find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:

\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3
\]

Thus, the remainder is:

\[
\boxed{3}
\]

so the product (4)(6)(1) = 24*1=24. now, we need to find 24 mod 7. let's divide 24 by 7: 7*3=21, so 24-21=3. so 24 ≡ 3 mod 7. therefore, the remainder is 3.
wait, is that correct? let me double-check. since n ≡ 2 mod 7, replacing n with 2 in the expression (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) gives (2+2)(2+4)(2+6)=4*6*8= 4*6*8= 192? then divide 192 by 7. let's check 7*27=189, so 192-189=3. yep, remainder is 3. so that works.
but does this method hold in general? because we replaced n with 2, even though n could be any number congruent to 2 mod7, like 9. let's test it. suppose n=9. then compute (9 +2)(9 +4)(9 +6)=11*13*15. now, compute this product: 11*13=143, 143*15=2145. divide 2145 by7. 7*306=2142. 2145-2142=3. remainder is 3. same as before.

the expression (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) evaluated at n=16 and n=23 both yield remainders of 3 when divided by 7.

so same remainder. therefore, the method is correct. so in general, if n ≡2 mod7, then (n +2), (n +4), (n +6) can be replaced by (2+2), (2+4), (2+6), then compute the product and take mod7.
alternatively, maybe we could have done the entire calculation modulo7. let's think again. since n ≡2 mod7, then:
n +2 ≡2 +2=4 mod7
n +4 ≡2 +4=6 mod7
n +6 ≡2 +6=8 ≡1 mod7
thus, the product (n +2)(n +4)(n +6) ≡4*6*1 mod7.
4*6=24; 24 mod7 is 3, then 3*1=3. therefore, the product is 3 mod7. hence, remainder is 3.
that's a bit more straightforward. so even if we do the substitution step by step, modulo 7, we get the same result. that's good.
wait, another thought. the problem says "if n ≡2 mod7, then...". so we can work entirely in modulo7 arithmetic. so given n ≡2, so we can substitute right away. but here's another approach: maybe factoring the expression in terms of n. but given the problem, perhaps it's overcomplicating.

then multiply by (n +6): (n^2 +6n +8)(n +6) = n^3 +6n^2 +8n +6n^2 +36n +48.
combine like terms: n^3 + (6n^2 +6n^2) + (8n +36n) +48 = n^3 +12n^2 +44n +48.

therefore, the polynomial simplifies to n^3 +5n^2 +2n +6 mod7.
since n ≡2 mod7, substitute n=2 into this polynomial:
2^3 +5*(2)^2 +2*(2) +6 = 8 +5*4 +4 +6 =8 +20 +4 +6= 40 +10=50. then 50 mod7. 7*7=49, so 50-49=1. wait, so 50 ≡1 mod7. wait, that's conflicting with the previous answer. hmm, there must be an error here.
wait, but earlier approaches gave remainder 3, but polynomial expansion gives 1. that's a problem. which one is correct? let's check.
wait, so let's take n=2. compute (2+2)(2+4)(2+6)=4*6*8=192. 192 divided by7: 7*27=189, remainder3. but if we plug n=2 into the expanded polynomial: 2^3 +5*(2)^2 +2*(2) +6=8 +20 +4 +6=38+6=44. then 44 mod7: 7*6=42, remainder2. wait 44-42=2. wait, so 44≡2 mod7. but 192≡3 mod7. that's a conflict. so that means somewhere i made a mistake in the expansion process.
wait, so perhaps when i expanded the polynomial and then reduced modulo7, the error is there. let me check my expansion again.
wait, first step: (n +2)(n +4) = n^2 +4n +2n +8 = n^2 +6n +8. that's correct.
multiply by (n +6): (n^2 +6n +8)(n +6) = n^3 +6n^2 +8n +6n^2 +48n +48. wait, here may be the mistake.
wait, when i do (n^2 +6n +8)(n +6), distribute each term:
n^2*n =n^3
n^2*6=6n^2
6n*n=6n^2
6n*6=36n
8*n=8n
8*6=48
so combining like terms:
n^3 + (6n^2 +6n^2) + (36n +8n) +48 =n^3 +12n^2 +44n +48. that seems right. but now, when substituting n=2:
2^3 +12*(2)^2 +44*(2) +48=8 +48 +88 +48= 8+48=56; 56+88=144; 144+48=192. so 192, which is the original expression. then 192 mod7 is 3. but when i reduced coefficients mod7 first, then substituted n=2, i got 1. so that must mean my coefficient reduction is wrong.
wait, let's re-express the polynomial n^3 +12n^2 +44n +48 mod7.
first, 12 mod7 is 12-7=5. so 12n^2 becomes5n^2.
44 mod7: 44-6*7=44-42=2. so 44n becomes2n.
48 mod7: 48 -7*6=48-42=6. so constant term is6.
therefore, polynomial mod7 is n^3 +5n^2 +2n +6. correct. now, substitute n=2:
2^3 +5*(2)^2 +2*(2) +6=8 +20 +4 +6=38+6=44. then 44 mod7 is 2, as 44=6*7 +2. wait, but 44≡2 mod7, but the actual expression (n +2)(n +4)(n+6) when n=2 is 4*6*8=192. 192 mod7 is 3. so inconsistency here.
therefore, something is wrong. but how? wait, perhaps the confusion is arising because expanding the polynomial and then taking mod7 is not equivalent to computing the original product mod7, because modulo operations can't be arbitrarily distributed without remainder theorems.
wait, no. if we expand the polynomial and then take each coefficient mod7, then set n=2, we should get the same result as evaluating the original expression mod7. but in this case, substituting n=2 into the original expression gives 192, which mod7 is3, but substituting n=2 into the mod7 polynomial gives44, which is2 mod7. therefore, there must be a miscalculation in either the polynomial evaluation or the original expression.
wait, let's double-check the original expression for n=2: (2 +2)(2 +4)(2 +6)=4*6*8=192. 192 divided by7: 7*27=189, so remainder3. correct.
now, substituting into the mod7 polynomial:
n^3 +5n^2 +2n +6, with n=2:
2^3=8
5*2^2=20
2*2=4
then total is8+20+4+6=38. 38 mod7 is38-35=3. wait, so 38≡3 mod7. but 38=5*7 +3, so remainder3. wait, but earlier i said 44 mod7. wait, this is confusing. wait in the previous calculation when substituting n=2 into the expanded polynomial before reducing mod7, we have 2^3 +12*2^2 +44*2 +48=8 +48 +88 +48=29+136=184? wait, no. wait, 8 +48=56, 56 +88=144, 144 +48=192. oh, right. but when we take each term mod7 first:
wait, n^3 +5n^2 +2n +6. coefficients are1,5,2,6. so for n=2:
first term: 2^3=8≡1 mod7 (since8-7=1)
second term:5*(2^2)=5*4=20≡6 mod7 (20-14=6)
third term:2*(2)=4≡4 mod7
fourth term:6≡6 mod7.
so adding up 1 +6 +4 +6=17≡3 mod7 (since17-14=3). so actually, it's3. so that's correct. so where did i go wrong before?
earlier, when i plugged n=2 into the expanded polynomial before reducing mod7, i got192, which is correct, but if i plug into the mod7 reduced polynomial, i should get the same result. wait, but when i computed the mod7 polynomial with n=2: first term 1, second term6, third term4, fourth term6. total is1+6+4+6=17≡3 mod7. which matches 192≡3 mod7. so that works.
but earlier, when i computed 8 +20 +4 +6=38, which is3 mod7 (38≡3 mod7). so why did i previously say 38+6=44? wait, that was a mistake. let me check:
wait, original mod7 polynomial is n^3 +5n^2 +2n +6. so substituting n=2:
2^3=8. 8 mod7=1.
5*(2^2)=5*4=20. 20 mod7=6 (20-14=6).
2*(2)=4. 4 mod7=4.
6 mod7=6.
then adding these terms:1 +6 +4 +6=17. 17 mod7=3. correct. so my original mistake was when i thought the total was38+6=44; no, the terms are1 +6 +4 +6=17. so 17 mod7=3. therefore, both methods agree. so why did i get confused before?
wait, in the polynomial expansion, after expanding we got n^3 +12n^2 +44n +48. then when substituting n=2, that's 2^3 +12*2^2 +44*2 +48=8 +48 +88 +48=192. then mod7 is3. if we first reduce the coefficients modulo7:
12 mod7=5, 44 mod7=2, 48 mod7=6. so polynomial is n^3 +5n^2 +2n +6. then substituting n=2: 2^3 +5*4 +2*2 +6=8 +20 +4 +6=38. 38 mod7=3. so both are correct. so why was there confusion before? ah, in my initial test, when i computed the expanded polynomial before reducing mod7 and said that 44 mod7 is2, but 44 is equivalent to 2 mod7, but when we compute the terms, we need to compute each term modulo7.
so if we do 8 +20 +4 +6=38, which is3 mod7. but 38 isn't the same as3, but 38≡3 mod7. so both are correct. so the confusion arose because when we compute the expression as written, we get192≡3, and when we compute the mod7 polynomial, we get38≡3. so all is well.
so why did i get 192 first and then 38? because 192 is the value of the expanded polynomial before taking mod7, and38 is the value after reducing the coefficients mod7 and then evaluating. but both are consistent. so the process of expanding and then reducing coefficients modulo7 is valid, but one must remember to take each coefficient modulo7 first, then perform the evaluation. so in essence, both approaches are correct, but the first approach (substituting n=2 into the original expression and then calculating the product modulo7) is much simpler and less error-prone.
therefore, the correct answer is3.
**final answer**
the final answer is 3
</think>

answer: given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the remainder when \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) is divided by 7.

first, we substitute \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \) into the expression:

\[
(n + 2) \equiv 2 + 2 = 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
(n + 4) \equiv 2 + 4 = 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
(n + 6) \equiv 2 + 6 = 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
\]

next, we calculate the product of these results modulo 7:

\[
(4)(6)(1) = 24 \pmod{7}
\]

finally, we find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:

\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3
\]

thus, the remainder is:

\[
\boxed{3}
\]
