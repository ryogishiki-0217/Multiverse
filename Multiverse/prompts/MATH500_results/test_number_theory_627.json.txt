Okay, so I need to solve this problem: If \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), then find the remainder when \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) is divided by 7.
Hmm, let's see.
The problem says that n leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 7.
So, basically, n is 2 more than a multiple of 7.
I need to find the remainder when the product \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) is divided by 7.
First, maybe I can substitute n with an expression in terms of 7.
Since \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), that means \( n = 7k + 2 \) for some integer k.
Maybe substituting this into the expression will help.
Let me try that.
So replace n with \( 7k + 2 \):
\( (7k + 2 + 2)(7k + 2 + 4)(7k + 2 + 6) \)
Simplify each term:
First term: \( 7k + 4 \)
Second term: \( 7k + 6 \)
Third term: \( 7k + 8 \)
But \( 7k + 8 \) can be written as \( 7k + 7 + 1 \), which is \( 7(k + 1) + 1 \).
So modulo 7, that's equivalent to 1.
Because 7(k + 1) is a multiple of 7, so when divided by 7, the remainder is 1.
Similarly, let's look at each term modulo 7:
First term: \( 7k + 4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \)
Second term: \( 7k + 6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \)
Third term: \( 7k + 8 \equiv 8 \pmod{7} \), which is \( 7 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \)
Therefore, the product \( (4)(6)(1) \pmod{7} \)
Multiply these together: 4*6 is 24, then 24*1 is 24.
Now, find 24 modulo 7.
7*3=21, so 24 - 21 = 3.
So the remainder is 3.
Wait, let me check that again.
4*6 is 24, 24*1 is 24, and 24 divided by 7 is 3*7=21, so remainder 3.
Alternatively, maybe instead of substituting n as 7k + 2, I can directly work with congruences.
Since n ≡ 2 mod 7, then:
n + 2 ≡ 2 + 2 ≡ 4 mod 7
n + 4 ≡ 2 + 4 ≡ 6 mod 7
n + 6 ≡ 2 + 6 ≡ 8 ≡ 1 mod 7
So the product is 4*6*1 = 24 mod 7, which is 3 mod 7.
Same answer.
This seems quicker.
So, if we think in terms of modular arithmetic, we can directly compute each term modulo 7 first, then multiply them together.
That makes sense because of the properties of modular arithmetic: congruences can be substituted and multiplied together.
So that's another way to do it.
Alternatively, perhaps expand the polynomial expression and then evaluate modulo 7.
Let's see:
Let's compute \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) first.
Maybe expand step by step.
First, multiply (n + 2)(n + 4):
= n^2 + 4n + 2n + 8 = n^2 + 6n + 8
Then multiply by (n + 6):
Multiply each term:
(n^2)(n) = n^3
n^2*6 = 6n^2
6n*n = 6n^2
6n*6 = 36n
8*n = 8n
8*6 = 48
So putting it all together:
n^3 + 6n^2 + 6n^2 + 36n + 8n + 48
Combine like terms:
n^3 + (6n^2 + 6n^2) + (36n + 8n) + 48
= n^3 + 12n^2 + 44n + 48
Now, since we are given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we can substitute n = 7k + 2, then compute the expression modulo 7.
But this might be tedious.
Alternatively, since we need to compute this polynomial modulo 7, maybe reduce the coefficients modulo 7 first.
Let's think in parallel.

1: The simplified coefficient for n^3 modulo 7.

2: The simplified coefficient for n^2 modulo 7.

2: The coefficient of n^2, 12, is reduced modulo 7. The result of 12 mod 7 is 5.
</Path>
<Path>
3: The term 44n modulo 7 is equivalent to 44 mod 7 multiplied by n, which is 44 mod 7 = 4, so the coefficient for n is 4.
</Path>
<Path>
4: The constant term 48 is reduced modulo 7. The calculation 48 divided by 7 is 6 with a remainder of 6, so 48 ≡ 6 mod 7.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The polynomial n^3 + 12n^2 + 44n + 48 simplifies to n^3 + 5n^2 + 4n + 6 modulo 7.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So the polynomial becomes \( n^3 + 5n^2 + 4n + 6 \pmod{7} \)
Now, substitute n ≡ 2 into this polynomial and compute modulo 7.
Compute each term:
n^3 when n=2 is 8.
8 mod7=1
5n^2=5*(4)=20 → 20 mod7=6
4n=4*(2)=8 →8 mod7=1
Constant term is 6
Now add them up: 1 + 6 + 1 + 6 = 14
14 mod7=0.
Wait, this gives 0?
But earlier methods gave 3.
Hmm, that's inconsistent.
There must be a mistake here.
Wait, let me check.
Wait, first, expanding the polynomial might have been error-prone.
Let me re-express the expansion step-by-step:
Original expression: \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \)
Let's first multiply the first two terms: (n + 2)(n + 4) = n^2 + 4n + 2n + 8 = n^2 + 6n + 8
Then multiply by (n + 6):
(n^2 + 6n + 8)(n + 6) = n^2(n + 6) + 6n(n + 6) + 8(n + 6)
= n^3 + 6n^2 + 6n^2 + 36n + 8n + 48
= n^3 + 12n^2 + 44n + 48
So, coefficients are 1, 12, 44, 48.
Then reducing coefficients modulo 7:
1 mod7=1
12 mod7= 12 - 7=5
44 mod7: 44 divided by7 is 6*7=42, so 44-42=2. So 44 mod7=2
48 mod7: 48 - 6*7=48-42=6. So 6.
Therefore, the polynomial mod7 is n^3 + 5n^2 + 2n + 6.
Then plugging n ≡ 2 mod7 into this:
Compute each term:
n^3 = 2^3=8. 8 mod7=1
5n^2=5*(4)=20. 20 mod7=6
2n=4. 4 mod7=4
Constant term=6.
So adding up: 1 + 6 +4 +6=17. 17 mod7 is 3.
Ah! So 17-14=3.
So answer is 3.
So this aligns with the previous answers.
Wait, so where did I go wrong earlier?
In the first attempt using substitution, I expanded the polynomial, reduced coefficients modulo 7, then substituted n=2.
When calculating the terms:
n^3 term: 1
5n^2 term: 5*(2)^2=20 →20 mod7=6
2n term:2*2=4
constant:6
Adding 1 + 6 +4 +6=17→17 mod7=3.
So that's correct.
So why did I get 0 earlier?
Let me check my arithmetic in the initial substitution method.
Wait, in my first substitution approach, where I replaced n with 7k + 2 and then evaluated:
First term:7k + 4 ≡4 mod7
Second term:7k +6≡6 mod7
Third term:7k +8≡1 mod7
Multiply 4*6*1=24→24 mod7=3.
So correct.
Then in the expansion approach, after correcting the coefficient reduction, we get 3.
So both methods give 3.
So why did I get 0 when I first computed substituting n=2 into the reduced polynomial?
Wait, perhaps because substituting n=2 into the reduced polynomial isn't valid.
Wait, no.
Since n ≡2 mod7, then n=7k +2, but when working with polynomials modulo7, we can replace n with 2 directly.
Let me test this.
Wait, if we have a polynomial f(n) ≡ n^3 +5n^2 +2n +6 mod7, and n ≡2 mod7, then f(n) ≡ f(2) mod7.
So computing f(2):
2^3 +5*(2)^2 +2*(2) +6=8 +20 +4 +6=38.
38 mod7=38-35=3.
So 3.
So that's correct.
So why when I first did this calculation, above, I added up the terms (1 +6 +4 +6=17) which is correct, then 17 mod7=3.
But initially, when I broke it down term by term, I also got 1 +6 +4 +6=17→3.
So why did I mention 0?
Wait, no, I didn't.
Let me check the original steps.
Wait, the user asked to show the reasoning process, so I was thinking aloud, showing possible approaches and checks.
Wait, in my reasoning above, I first tried substituting n=7k +2 into the product expression, then simplifying each term modulo7, getting 4,6,1 and multiplying them, getting 24→3 mod7.
Then I thought about expanding the polynomial, which led to the expression n^3 +12n^2 +44n +48.
Then reducing the coefficients mod7: 1,5,4,6.
Wait, initially, when reducing the coefficients, I thought 44 mod7=4?
Wait, no.
44 divided by7 is 6*7=42, so 44-42=2.
So 44≡2 mod7.
So that was the mistake.
In my first polynomial coefficient reduction, I thought 44 mod7=4, but actually 44 mod7=2.
Therefore, when I first computed the polynomial modulo7, I had coefficient 4 for n, which is incorrect.
It's coefficient 2 for n.
Therefore, when substituting n=2 into the polynomial, it should be:
1*(2)^3 +5*(2)^2 +2*(2) +6=8 +20 +4 +6=38≡3 mod7.
But when I first wrote it, I had 4*(2)=8, which would be incorrect.
So this was the mistake.
Therefore, the correct answer is 3.
So all methods converge to 3.
Therefore, the correct remainder is 3.
**Final Answer**
the final answer is \boxed{3}
</Think>

Answer: Given \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the remainder when \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) is divided by 7.

First, we substitute \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \) into the expression:
- \( n + 2 \equiv 2 + 2 \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \)
- \( n + 4 \equiv 2 + 4 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \)
- \( n + 6 \equiv 2 + 6 \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \)

Next, we multiply these results together:
\[
4 \times 6 \times 1 = 24
\]

Finally, we find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:
\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \quad \text{with a remainder of} \quad 24 - 3 \times 7 = 24 - 21 = 3
\]

Thus, the remainder when \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) is divided by 7 is \(\boxed{3}\).

answer: given \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the remainder when \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) is divided by 7.

first, we substitute \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \) into the expression:
- \( n + 2 \equiv 2 + 2 \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \)
- \( n + 4 \equiv 2 + 4 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \)
- \( n + 6 \equiv 2 + 6 \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \)

next, we multiply these results together:
\[
4 \times 6 \times 1 = 24
\]

finally, we find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:
\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \quad \text{with a remainder of} \quad 24 - 3 \times 7 = 24 - 21 = 3
\]

thus, the remainder when \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) is divided by 7 is \(\boxed{3}\)
