Okay, so I need to figure out the unicycle's speed in inches per second given that the wheel has a radius of 9 inches and makes 2 revolutions every 3 seconds.
Alright, let's break this down step by step.
First, I remember that the speed of the unicycle is the same as the linear speed of a point on the circumference of the wheel.
To find the linear speed, I can use the formula that relates linear speed (v) to angular speed (ω) and radius (r): v = ω * r.
Wait, yeah, that sounds right.
So I need to find the angular speed first and then multiply it by the radius to get the linear speed.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: Determine the angular speed (ω) based on the number of revolutions and time.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: Determine the linear speed (v) using the angular speed (ω) and radius (r).
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The angular speed (ω) is defined as the rate of change of the angular displacement, measured in radians per unit time. Since the unicycle's wheel makes 2 revolutions every 3 seconds, ω can be calculated by converting the number of revolutions into radians and dividing by the time.
One complete revolution is equivalent to 2π radians.
Therefore, 2 revolutions correspond to 4π radians.
Consequently, the angular speed ω is 4π radians divided by 3 seconds, which equals (4π/3) radians per second.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The linear speed (v) is calculated by multiplying the angular speed (ω) by the radius (r), yielding v = (4π/3) * 9 inches. This multiplication results in a linear speed of 12π inches per second.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The angular speed (ω) is determined to be 4π/3 radians per second, and the linear speed (v) is found to be 12π inches per second.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Wait, but the problem says the wheel makes 2 revolutions every 3 seconds, so does that mean the angular speed is 2 revolutions per 3 seconds?
Let me double-check.
Yeah, angular speed is usually in radians per second, but if I calculate it in revolutions per second and then convert to radians, that's fine.
So 2 revolutions every 3 seconds is equivalent to 2/3 revolutions per second.
Then, since 1 revolution is 2π radians, 2/3 revolutions per second is (2/3)*2π = 4π/3 radians per second.
So that's correct.
Then multiplying by radius, which is 9 inches, so linear speed is 4π/3 * 9 = (4π * 9)/3 = (36π)/3 = 12π inches per second.
So that seems straightforward.
But let me think again.
Alternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this.
Instead of using angular speed, maybe calculate the circumference of the wheel first.
The circumference C of a wheel with radius 9 inches is C = 2πr = 18π inches.
Since the wheel makes 2 revolutions every 3 seconds, the distance covered in 3 seconds is 2 times the circumference.
So distance = 2 * 18π = 36π inches.
Therefore, in 3 seconds, the unicycle travels 36π inches.
So the speed in inches per second would be 36π inches / 3 seconds = 12π inches per second.
Ah, that's another way to get the same answer.
So whether I use the angular speed method or the circumference method, the answer is 12π inches per second.
That gives me more confidence that it's correct.
Let me just verify one more time.
Circumference is 2πr = 18π inches.
Two revolutions would be 36π inches.
This happens in 3 seconds.
So per second, it's 36π / 3 = 12π in/s.
Yes, that's right.
So the speed is 12π inches per second.
But wait, does the problem perhaps expect the answer in decimal form?
Hmm, the problem doesn't specify, but since π is a mathematical constant and the problem is giving measurements in inches and seconds (no request for an approximate value), it's likely acceptable to leave the answer in terms of π.
However, maybe they want a numerical value.
Wait, the problem says "solve" but doesn't specify.
Let me check the problem statement again.
"Solve the following math problem: Charlie is riding on his unicycle.
If the unicycle's wheel has a radius of 9 inches and makes 2 revolutions every 3 seconds, what is the unicycle's speed in inches per second?"
So it does say "in inches per second", and inches per second is the unit, but it didn't say to use a decimal approximation.
So 12π is a precise answer.
Since π is approximately 3.1416, 12π is about 37.6992 inches per second.
But since the problem might want the exact answer, probably in terms of π.
But let me see if 12π inches per second can be considered the right format.
Wait, the problem says "the unicycle's speed in inches per second", and since π is a standard constant, it's acceptable.
In math problems, if the answer involves π, it's often left in terms of π unless specified otherwise.
So I think 12π is correct.
Alternatively, maybe they expect the answer as a numerical value using the exact fraction 22/7 for π?
But that's not common nowadays; usually, if they want a decimal, they'll specify.
Since they specified inches per second and didn't say "approximately" or "round to the nearest hundredth," I think leaving it as 12π is correct.
So the answer is 12π inches per second.
But let me confirm once more.
If the wheel has a radius of 9 inches, circumference is 18π inches.
In 3 seconds, it makes 2 revolutions, so 2 * 18π = 36π inches traveled in 3 seconds.
So per second, 36π /3 = 12π in/s.
Yep.
No errors in that calculation.
So final answer is 12π.
Therefore, I'll go with that.
**Final Answer**
\boxed{12\pi}
</Think>

Answer: To determine the unicycle's speed in inches per second, we start by calculating the circumference of the wheel, which is given by \( 2\pi r \). With a radius of 9 inches, the circumference is:
\[
2\pi \times 9 = 18\pi \text{ inches}
\]

Next, we know the wheel makes 2 revolutions every 3 seconds. Therefore, the distance covered in 3 seconds is:
\[
2 \times 18\pi = 36\pi \text{ inches}
\]

To find the speed in inches per second, we divide the total distance by the total time:
\[
\frac{36\pi}{3} = 12\pi \text{ inches per second}
\]

Thus, the unicycle's speed is:
\[
\boxed{12\pi}
\]
