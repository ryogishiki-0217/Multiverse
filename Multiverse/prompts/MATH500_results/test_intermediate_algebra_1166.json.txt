Okay, so I need to find the minimum value of this expression: \[\frac{(a + b + c)[(a + b)^2 + (a + b + 4c)^2]}{abc}.\] Where a, b, c are positive real numbers.
Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down step by step.
First, let me understand the structure of the expression.
The numerator is (a + b + c) multiplied by the sum of two squares: (a + b)^2 and (a + b + 4c)^2.
The denominator is abc.
So, my goal is to minimize this whole fraction.
Since a, b, c are positive, I can consider using inequalities like AM-GM or Cauchy-Schwarz to find a lower bound.
But first, maybe I should expand the numerator to see if it simplifies.
Let me compute [(a + b)^2 + (a + b + 4c)^2].
Let me denote S = a + b.
Then the expression becomes [S^2 + (S + 4c)^2].
Let's expand that: S^2 + (S^2 + 8cS + 16c^2) = 2S^2 + 8cS + 16c^2.
So, substituting back S = a + b, the numerator is (a + b + c)(2(a + b)^2 + 8c(a + b) + 16c^2).
Hmm, maybe factoring out a 2 from the terms inside: 2[(a + b)^2 + 4c(a + b) + 8c^2].
Wait, let's check: 2*( (a + b)^2 + 4c(a + b) + 8c^2 ) = 2*(a + b)^2 + 8c(a + b) + 16c^2, which matches the previous expression.
So, the numerator becomes (a + b + c)*2*( (a + b)^2 + 4c(a + b) + 8c^2 ).
So the entire expression is: \[\frac{(a + b + c) \cdot 2 \cdot [(a + b)^2 + 4c(a + b) + 8c^2]}{abc}.\]
But perhaps instead of expanding, we can consider substitutions to simplify variables.
Let me think.
Let me set S = a + b.
Then the numerator is (S + c)[S^2 + (S + 4c)^2].
Wait, actually, earlier I computed that as 2(S^2 + 4cS + 8c^2).
So then the numerator is (S + c)*2*(S^2 + 4cS + 8c^2).
Then the denominator is abc.
Since S = a + b, and c is the other variable.
But we have three variables a, b, c, so maybe we can introduce more substitutions.
Alternatively, since a and b appear in sums and products, perhaps symmetry is involved.
But a and b are separate variables here.
Alternatively, maybe set some ratios, like let b = ka for some positive real k, and express everything in terms of a and c.
Let me try that.
Let’s assume b = ka.
Then S = a + b = a + ka = a(1 + k).
Let’s denote that as A = 1 + k, so S = aA.
Then c is still c.
Then the numerator becomes (S + c) * 2 * [S^2 + 4cS + 8c^2].
Substituting S = aA: (aA + c) * 2 * [ (aA)^2 + 4c*aA + 8c^2 ].
Denominator is abc = a * ka * c = ka^2 c.
So the entire expression becomes: \[\frac{(aA + c) \cdot 2 \cdot [a^2 A^2 + 4aAc + 8c^2]}{ka^2 c}.\]
Let me write this again: Numerator: 2*(aA + c)*(a^2 A^2 + 4aAc + 8c^2)
Denominator: ka^2 c
So, simplifying the fraction: 2/(ka^2 c) * (aA + c)*(a^2 A^2 + 4aAc + 8c^2)
Multiply the terms: numerator becomes 2*(aA + c)*(a^2 A^2 + 4aAc + 8c^2) / (ka^2 c)
Let me expand the numerator step by step.
First, expand (aA + c)(a^2 A^2 + 4aAc + 8c^2).
Multiply term by term:
= aA*(a^2 A^2) + aA*4aAc + aA*8c^2 + c*(a^2 A^2) + c*4aAc + c*8c^2
Compute each term:
1) aA * a^2 A^2 = a^3 A^3
2) aA * 4aAc = 4a^2 A^2 c
3) aA * 8c^2 = 8a A c^2
4) c * a^2 A^2 = a^2 A^2 c
5) c * 4aAc = 4a A c^2
6) c * 8c^2 = 8c^3
So combining terms: a^3 A^3 + 4a^2 A^2 c + 8a A c^2 + a^2 A^2 c + 4a A c^2 + 8c^3
Combine like terms:
a^3 A^3 + (4a^2 A^2 c + a^2 A^2 c) + (8a A c^2 + 4a A c^2) + 8c^3
= a^3 A^3 + 5a^2 A^2 c + 12a A c^2 + 8c^3
So the numerator is 2*(a^3 A^3 + 5a^2 A^2 c + 12a A c^2 + 8c^3)
Denominator is ka^2 c
Therefore, the expression becomes: 2*(a^3 A^3 + 5a^2 A^2 c + 12a A c^2 + 8c^3)/(ka^2 c)
Let me divide each term in the numerator by ka^2 c:
First term: 2*a^3 A^3 / (ka^2 c) = 2a A^3 / (k c)
Second term: 2*5a^2 A^2 c / (ka^2 c) = 10 A^2 / k
Third term: 2*12a A c^2 / (ka^2 c) = 24 A c / (k a)
Fourth term: 2*8c^3 / (ka^2 c) = 16 c^2 / (k a^2)
Therefore, putting it all together: The expression equals (2a A^3)/(k c) + 10 A^2 /k + (24 A c)/(k a) + 16 c^2/(k a^2)
This seems more complicated.
Maybe this approach isn't the best.
Let me see.
Alternatively, perhaps we can use Hölder's inequality or another inequality to find the minimum.
Let me recall Hölder's inequality: it states that for positive real numbers and exponents p, q such that 1/p + 1/q = 1, then the sum of products is minimized/maximized...
Wait, maybe not.
Alternatively, since the expression is homogeneous, we can set some scaling to simplify variables.
Let me check the degree of the expression.
Let me see: numerator is (a + b + c) * [ (a + b)^2 + (a + b + 4c)^2 ]
Denominator is abc.
Let me compute the degree of numerator: (degree 1) * (degree 2 + degree 2) = degree 3.
Denominator has degree 3.
So the entire expression is degree 0, which means it's homogeneous.
Therefore, we can set some ratios between variables to simplify.
For example, set b = a, c = ka, then express in terms of a and k, then minimize.
Alternatively, set a = tb, c = ub, express in terms of b, t, u, etc.
Let me try that.
Let’s set a = tb, c = ub, where t and u are positive real numbers.
Then express the entire expression in terms of t, u (since b can be eliminated as a common variable due to homogeneity).
Let me try that.
So, let a = tb, c = ub.
Then a, b, c are expressed in terms of b, t, u.
Then the numerator is (a + b + c)[(a + b)^2 + (a + b + 4c)^2] = (tb + b + ub)[(tb + b)^2 + (tb + b + 4ub)^2]
Simplify: = [ (t + 1 + u)b ][ (t + 1)^2 b^2 + (t + 1 + 4u)^2 b^2 ]
Factor out b^2: = [ (t + 1 + u)b ] [ b^2 { (t + 1)^2 + (t + 1 + 4u)^2 } ]
Multiply: = b^3 (t + 1 + u) [ (t + 1)^2 + (t + 1 + 4u)^2 ]
Denominator is abc = tb * b * ub = t u b^3
Therefore, the expression becomes: [ b^3 (t + 1 + u) ( (t + 1)^2 + (t + 1 + 4u)^2 ) ] / ( t u b^3 )
Cancel b^3: (t + 1 + u) ( (t + 1)^2 + (t + 1 + 4u)^2 ) / ( t u )
So now, the problem reduces to minimizing the expression: \[ \frac{(t + 1 + u) \left[ (t + 1)^2 + (t + 1 + 4u)^2 \right]}{t u} \] where t and u are positive real numbers.
This seems better because now we have two variables instead of three.
Maybe we can set t = u or some relation to minimize.
Let me denote S = t + 1 + u.
Then perhaps?
Wait, let me see.
Alternatively, let’s set t = 1, assuming symmetry.
If we set t = 1, then a = b.
Let’s see if that gives some nice expression.
Let me try t = 1.
So a = b, then: The expression becomes: \[ \frac{(1 + 1 + u) \left[ (1 + 1)^2 + (1 + 1 + 4u)^2 \right]}{1 \cdot u} = \frac{(2 + u)(4 + (2 + 4u)^2)}{u} \]
Compute (2 + 4u)^2: = 4 + 16u + 16u^2.
Wait, (2 + 4u)^2 = 4 + 16u + 16u2, yes.
So then: 4 + (4 + 16u + 16u2) = 8 + 16u + 16u2.
So numerator is (2 + u)(8 + 16u + 16u2).
Multiply this out: = 2*8 + 2*16u + 2*16u2 + u*8 + u*16u + u*16u2
= 16 + 32u + 32u2 + 8u + 16u2 + 16u3
Combine like terms: 16 + (32u +8u) + (32u2 +16u2) +16u3 =16 +40u +48u2 +16u3
So the expression becomes (16u3 +48u2 +40u +16)/u =16u2 +48u +40 +16/u
So now, we need to minimize 16u2 +48u +40 +16/u.
Let’s denote this function as f(u) =16u2 +48u +40 +16/u.
To find the critical points, take derivative: f’(u) =32u +48 -16/u2.
Set equal to zero:32u +48 -16/u2=0.
Multiply both sides by u2:32u3 +48u2 -16=0.
Divide by 16:2u3 +3u2 -1=0.
Factor this cubic equation.
Let me try rational roots.
Possible roots are ±1, ±1/2.
Let’s test u=1:2+3-1=4≠0.
u=1/2:2*(1/8) +3*(1/4) -1=0.25 +0.75 -1=0.
So u=1/2 is a root.
Therefore, factor out (u -1/2).
Perform polynomial division: 2u3 +3u2 -1 divided by (u -1/2).
Alternatively, synthetic division: Using u=1/2: Coefficients:2 | 3 | 0 | -1
But maybe doing multiplication: Let me write (u -1/2)(Au2 + Bu + C) = 2u3 +3u2 -1
Equate coefficients: First, multiply out: Au3 + Bu2 + Cu - (1/2)Au2 - (1/2)Bu - (1/2)C = Au3 + (B - (1/2)A)u2 + (C - (1/2)B)u - (1/2)C
Set equal to 2u3 +3u2 +0u -1.
So: 1. A =2
2. B - (1/2)A =3 ⇒ B -1=3 ⇒ B=4
3. C - (1/2)B =0 ⇒ C -2=0 ⇒ C=2
4. - (1/2)C =-1 ⇒ -1=-1, which is good.
Therefore, the factorization is (u -1/2)(2u2 +4u +2).
Simplify 2u2 +4u +2=2(u2 +2u +1)=2(u +1)^2.
Therefore, the cubic factors as 2(u -1/2)(u +1)^2.
Therefore, the roots are u=1/2 and u=-1 (double root).
Since u is positive (as c is positive and u = c/b), we only consider u=1/2.
Therefore, the critical point is at u=1/2.
Let’s check if this is a minimum.
Second derivative test: f’’(u)=32 +32/u3.
Since u>0, 32 +32/u3 >0, so convex, so u=1/2 is a local minimum.
Therefore, the minimum of f(u) occurs at u=1/2.
Compute f(1/2)=16*(1/2)^2 +48*(1/2) +40 +16/(1/2)
=16*(1/4) +24 +40 +32
=4 +24 +40 +32=100
So when t=1 and u=1/2, the expression is 100.
But is this the global minimum?
Wait, since f(u) approaches infinity as u approaches 0 or infinity, the cubic had a root at u=1/2, and since the second derivative is positive, yes, this is the global minimum for u>0.
Therefore, in this case, when a = b, c = (1/2)b, the expression achieves a value of 100.
But does this give the actual minimum?
Wait, but perhaps I made a substitution assuming a = tb, c = ub, which scaled variables such that b=1.
However, the problem is symmetric apart from the structure of the expression.
Wait, actually, the original problem isn't symmetric in a, b, c.
The expression treats a and b symmetrically in some parts but c is added separately.
So maybe setting a = b is a good approach, as the expression is symmetric in a, b.
Alternatively, maybe there's another combination.
But let me verify.
Wait, when I set a = tb, c = ub, and I found that when t=1, u=1/2, the expression is 100.
But perhaps another substitution would lead to a lower value?
Alternatively, maybe the minimum is indeed 100.
But let me check with another approach.
Alternatively, use Hölder's inequality.
Let me recall Hölder's inequality: for positive reals and exponents p, q such that 1/p +1/q=1, then sum a_i b_i <= (sum a_i^p)^{1/p} (sum b_i^q)^{1/q}}.
But here, the expression is [(a + b + c)(something)] / (abc).
Alternatively, maybe split the numerator and apply AM-GH.
Wait, let me write the numerator again: (a + b + c)[(a + b)^2 + (a + b + 4c)^2].
Let S = a + b.
Then, (S + c)[S2 + (S + 4c)^2].
Expand that: = (S + c)[S2 + S2 +8cS +16c2] = (S + c)(2S2 +8cS +16c2).
As before, which simplifies to 2(S + c)(S2 +4cS +8c2).
So, need to minimize [2(S + c)(S2 +4cS +8c2)] / (abc).
But S = a + b, so variables are S and c.
But a and b are positive, so a, b >0, hence S >0, c >0.
So perhaps express in terms of S and c, and then use AM-GM.
Alternatively, let’s set variables: let’s set S = a + b, and then abc = ab*c.
Since S = a + b, ab <= (S/2)^2 by AM-GM.
So maybe we can use that?
But then, since ab <= (S/2)^2, so the denominator abc <= (S/2)^2 * c.
Therefore, the expression >= [2(S + c)(S2 +4cS +8c2)] / [(S/2)^2 c] = 2(S + c)(S2 +4cS +8c2) * 4 / (S2 c) = 8(S + c)(S2 +4cS +8c2)/(S2 c)
Therefore, if we bound the expression in terms of S and c, then find minimal value over S and c.
But perhaps this can be minimized over S and c.
Let me try.
Let’s denote t = S/c.
Then, let S = tc.
Then t is a positive real number.
Then, substituting S = tc into the expression: 8(S + c)(S2 +4cS +8c2)/(S2 c) = 8(tc + c)(t2c2 +4c*tc +8c2)/(t2c2 * c)
Simplify numerator: 8*(tc + c)*(t2c2 +4tc2 +8c2) =8*c*(t +1)*c2*(t2 +4t +8) =8c3(t +1)(t2 +4t +8)
Denominator: t2 c3
Therefore, the expression simplifies to 8(t +1)(t2 +4t +8)/t2
Therefore, the entire expression is bounded below by 8(t +1)(t2 +4t +8)/t2, and this bound is achieved when ab = (S/2)^2, i.e., when a = b.
Therefore, the minimal value of the original expression is at least the minimal value of 8(t +1)(t2 +4t +8)/t2 over t >0.
Therefore, now, we need to minimize the function f(t) =8(t +1)(t2 +4t +8)/t2.
Let me expand this: First, expand (t +1)(t2 +4t +8): = t(t2 +4t +8) +1*(t2 +4t +8) = t3 +4t2 +8t +t2 +4t +8 = t3 +5t2 +12t +8
Therefore, f(t) =8(t3 +5t2 +12t +8)/t2 =8(t +5 +12/t +8/t2) =8t +40 +96/t +64/t2
Therefore, f(t) =8t +40 +96/t +64/t2.
Now, to find the minimum of this function, take derivative: f’(t) =8 -96/t2 -128/t3.
Set equal to zero:8 -96/t2 -128/t3=0.
Multiply both sides by t3 to eliminate denominators:8t3 -96t -128=0.
Divide by 8: t3 -12t -16=0.
Now, let's attempt to solve t3 -12t -16=0.
Looking for rational roots, tried t=2: 8 -24 -16= -32≠0.
t=4:64 -48 -16=64-64=0.
So t=4 is a root.
Therefore, factor as (t -4)(...).
Polynomial division: t3 -12t -16 divided by (t -4).
Using synthetic division: Bring down 1, multiply by 4:4
4 | 1 | 0 | -12 | -16
Calculate:
First row: 1 | 0 | -12 | -16
Second row: Bring down 1
Multiply by 4:4 | 16 | 32
Add: 1+4=5; 0+4=4; -12+16=4; -16+32=16
Wait, this gives: 1 |4 |4 |16
So quotient is t2 +4t +4, remainder 16.
Wait, that doesn't seem right.
Alternatively, maybe I did the synthetic division wrong.
Wait, divisor is t -4, so root is 4.
Using synthetic division:
4 | 1 | 0 | -12 | -16
Bring down 1.
4*1=4
Add to next coefficient 0 +4=4
4*4=16
Add to -12: -12 +16=4
4*4=16
Add to -16: -16 +16=0
So remainder is 0, and quotient is t2 +4t +4.
Therefore, factors as (t -4)(t +2)^2.
So roots are t=4 and t=-2 (double root).
Since t=S/c is positive, so only t=4 is valid.
Therefore, critical point at t=4.
Second derivative test: f''(t) derivative of f’(t)=8 -96/t2 -128/t3
f''(t)= 192/t3 +384/t4.
Since t>0, f''(t) >0, so convex, so t=4 is a local minimum.
Therefore, the minimum of f(t) is at t=4.
Calculate f(4)=8*4 +40 +96/4 +64/42
Compute each term: 8*4=32, 40=40, 96/4=24, 64/(4^2)=64/16=4.
So total is 32 +40 +24 +4=100.
Therefore, the minimal value of the expression is 100.
Wait, so when t=4, which is S/c=4, so S=4c.
Since S =a +b, so a +b=4c.
Also, earlier, in the Hölder approach, we had the bound f(t)=8(t +1)(t2 +4t +8)/t2, which when minimized gives 100.
But in that approach, equality holds when a = b, as per the AM-GM condition.
So when a = b, and S =4c, which implies a + b =4c, but a = b, so 2a =4c ⇒ a=2c, b=2c.
Then c=c.
So in variables a, b, c, the equality case is a = b =2c.
Let me verify this with the previous substitution where I set t=1 (a = b) and found u=1/2 (c= u*b =0.5*b), so c=0.5b, and since a =b, then a +b=2b=4c=4*0.5b=2b, which matches.
Therefore, in this case, a =b=2c, so indeed, when a and b are each twice c, the expression achieves the minimum.
Therefore, the minimal value is 100.
Therefore, after going through substitution, homogeniety, and checking via Hölder's inequality and AM-GM, the minimum value is 100, achieved when a =b=2c.
Therefore, the answer is \boxed{100}
</Think>

Answer: Given positive real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), we need to find the minimum value of the expression:

\[
\frac{(a + b + c)[(a + b)^2 + (a + b + 4c)^2]}{abc}
\]

First, we recognize that the expression is homogeneous of degree 0, allowing us to use substitutions to simplify the variables. By setting \(a = b\) and \(c = \frac{1}{2}a\), we can reduce the problem to a single variable. 

Let \(a = b = 2c\). Then, substituting \(a = 2c\) and \(b = 2c\) into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{(2c + 2c + c)[(2c + 2c)^2 + (2c + 2c + 4c)^2]}{(2c)(2c)c}
\]

Simplifying the terms inside the expression:

- \(a + b + c = 2c + 2c + c = 5c\)
- \((a + b)^2 = (4c)^2 = 16c^2\)
- \((a + b + 4c)^2 = (4c + 4c)^2 = (8c)^2 = 64c^2\)

Thus, the numerator becomes:

\[
5c \left(16c^2 + 64c^2\right) = 5c \cdot 80c^2 = 400c^3
\]

The denominator is:

\[
(2c)(2c)c = 4c^3
\]

Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{400c^3}{4c^3} = 100
\]

To confirm this is the minimum, we use calculus. By setting \(t = \frac{a + b}{c}\) and simplifying the expression, we derive a function in terms of \(t\) and find its critical points. Solving the cubic equation \(t^3 - 12t - 16 = 0\), we find \(t = 4\) is the root, leading to the minimum value of 100.

Thus, the minimum value of the given expression is:

\[
\boxed{100}
\]

okay, so i need to find the minimum value of this expression: \[\frac{(a + b + c)[(a + b)^2 + (a + b + 4c)^2]}{abc}.\] where a, b, c are positive real numbers.
hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe i can break it down step by step.
first, let me understand the structure of the expression.
the numerator is (a + b + c) multiplied by the sum of two squares: (a + b)^2 and (a + b + 4c)^2.
the denominator is abc.
so, my goal is to minimize this whole fraction.
since a, b, c are positive, i can consider using inequalities like am-gm or cauchy-schwarz to find a lower bound.
but first, maybe i should expand the numerator to see if it simplifies.
let me compute [(a + b)^2 + (a + b + 4c)^2].
let me denote s = a + b.
then the expression becomes [s^2 + (s + 4c)^2].
let's expand that: s^2 + (s^2 + 8cs + 16c^2) = 2s^2 + 8cs + 16c^2.
so, substituting back s = a + b, the numerator is (a + b + c)(2(a + b)^2 + 8c(a + b) + 16c^2).
hmm, maybe factoring out a 2 from the terms inside: 2[(a + b)^2 + 4c(a + b) + 8c^2].
wait, let's check: 2*( (a + b)^2 + 4c(a + b) + 8c^2 ) = 2*(a + b)^2 + 8c(a + b) + 16c^2, which matches the previous expression.
so, the numerator becomes (a + b + c)*2*( (a + b)^2 + 4c(a + b) + 8c^2 ).
so the entire expression is: \[\frac{(a + b + c) \cdot 2 \cdot [(a + b)^2 + 4c(a + b) + 8c^2]}{abc}.\]
but perhaps instead of expanding, we can consider substitutions to simplify variables.
let me think.
let me set s = a + b.
then the numerator is (s + c)[s^2 + (s + 4c)^2].
wait, actually, earlier i computed that as 2(s^2 + 4cs + 8c^2).
so then the numerator is (s + c)*2*(s^2 + 4cs + 8c^2).
then the denominator is abc.
since s = a + b, and c is the other variable.
but we have three variables a, b, c, so maybe we can introduce more substitutions.
alternatively, since a and b appear in sums and products, perhaps symmetry is involved.
but a and b are separate variables here.
alternatively, maybe set some ratios, like let b = ka for some positive real k, and express everything in terms of a and c.
let me try that.
let’s assume b = ka.
then s = a + b = a + ka = a(1 + k).
let’s denote that as a = 1 + k, so s = aa.
then c is still c.
then the numerator becomes (s + c) * 2 * [s^2 + 4cs + 8c^2].
substituting s = aa: (aa + c) * 2 * [ (aa)^2 + 4c*aa + 8c^2 ].
denominator is abc = a * ka * c = ka^2 c.
so the entire expression becomes: \[\frac{(aa + c) \cdot 2 \cdot [a^2 a^2 + 4aac + 8c^2]}{ka^2 c}.\]
let me write this again: numerator: 2*(aa + c)*(a^2 a^2 + 4aac + 8c^2)
denominator: ka^2 c
so, simplifying the fraction: 2/(ka^2 c) * (aa + c)*(a^2 a^2 + 4aac + 8c^2)
multiply the terms: numerator becomes 2*(aa + c)*(a^2 a^2 + 4aac + 8c^2) / (ka^2 c)
let me expand the numerator step by step.
first, expand (aa + c)(a^2 a^2 + 4aac + 8c^2).
multiply term by term:
= aa*(a^2 a^2) + aa*4aac + aa*8c^2 + c*(a^2 a^2) + c*4aac + c*8c^2
compute each term:
1) aa * a^2 a^2 = a^3 a^3
2) aa * 4aac = 4a^2 a^2 c
3) aa * 8c^2 = 8a a c^2
4) c * a^2 a^2 = a^2 a^2 c
5) c * 4aac = 4a a c^2
6) c * 8c^2 = 8c^3
so combining terms: a^3 a^3 + 4a^2 a^2 c + 8a a c^2 + a^2 a^2 c + 4a a c^2 + 8c^3
combine like terms:
a^3 a^3 + (4a^2 a^2 c + a^2 a^2 c) + (8a a c^2 + 4a a c^2) + 8c^3
= a^3 a^3 + 5a^2 a^2 c + 12a a c^2 + 8c^3
so the numerator is 2*(a^3 a^3 + 5a^2 a^2 c + 12a a c^2 + 8c^3)
denominator is ka^2 c
therefore, the expression becomes: 2*(a^3 a^3 + 5a^2 a^2 c + 12a a c^2 + 8c^3)/(ka^2 c)
let me divide each term in the numerator by ka^2 c:
first term: 2*a^3 a^3 / (ka^2 c) = 2a a^3 / (k c)
second term: 2*5a^2 a^2 c / (ka^2 c) = 10 a^2 / k
third term: 2*12a a c^2 / (ka^2 c) = 24 a c / (k a)
fourth term: 2*8c^3 / (ka^2 c) = 16 c^2 / (k a^2)
therefore, putting it all together: the expression equals (2a a^3)/(k c) + 10 a^2 /k + (24 a c)/(k a) + 16 c^2/(k a^2)
this seems more complicated.
maybe this approach isn't the best.
let me see.
alternatively, perhaps we can use hölder's inequality or another inequality to find the minimum.
let me recall hölder's inequality: it states that for positive real numbers and exponents p, q such that 1/p + 1/q = 1, then the sum of products is minimized/maximized...
wait, maybe not.
alternatively, since the expression is homogeneous, we can set some scaling to simplify variables.
let me check the degree of the expression.
let me see: numerator is (a + b + c) * [ (a + b)^2 + (a + b + 4c)^2 ]
denominator is abc.
let me compute the degree of numerator: (degree 1) * (degree 2 + degree 2) = degree 3.
denominator has degree 3.
so the entire expression is degree 0, which means it's homogeneous.
therefore, we can set some ratios between variables to simplify.
for example, set b = a, c = ka, then express in terms of a and k, then minimize.
alternatively, set a = tb, c = ub, express in terms of b, t, u, etc.
let me try that.
let’s set a = tb, c = ub, where t and u are positive real numbers.
then express the entire expression in terms of t, u (since b can be eliminated as a common variable due to homogeneity).
let me try that.
so, let a = tb, c = ub.
then a, b, c are expressed in terms of b, t, u.
then the numerator is (a + b + c)[(a + b)^2 + (a + b + 4c)^2] = (tb + b + ub)[(tb + b)^2 + (tb + b + 4ub)^2]
simplify: = [ (t + 1 + u)b ][ (t + 1)^2 b^2 + (t + 1 + 4u)^2 b^2 ]
factor out b^2: = [ (t + 1 + u)b ] [ b^2 { (t + 1)^2 + (t + 1 + 4u)^2 } ]
multiply: = b^3 (t + 1 + u) [ (t + 1)^2 + (t + 1 + 4u)^2 ]
denominator is abc = tb * b * ub = t u b^3
therefore, the expression becomes: [ b^3 (t + 1 + u) ( (t + 1)^2 + (t + 1 + 4u)^2 ) ] / ( t u b^3 )
cancel b^3: (t + 1 + u) ( (t + 1)^2 + (t + 1 + 4u)^2 ) / ( t u )
so now, the problem reduces to minimizing the expression: \[ \frac{(t + 1 + u) \left[ (t + 1)^2 + (t + 1 + 4u)^2 \right]}{t u} \] where t and u are positive real numbers.
this seems better because now we have two variables instead of three.
maybe we can set t = u or some relation to minimize.
let me denote s = t + 1 + u.
then perhaps?
wait, let me see.
alternatively, let’s set t = 1, assuming symmetry.
if we set t = 1, then a = b.
let’s see if that gives some nice expression.
let me try t = 1.
so a = b, then: the expression becomes: \[ \frac{(1 + 1 + u) \left[ (1 + 1)^2 + (1 + 1 + 4u)^2 \right]}{1 \cdot u} = \frac{(2 + u)(4 + (2 + 4u)^2)}{u} \]
compute (2 + 4u)^2: = 4 + 16u + 16u^2.
wait, (2 + 4u)^2 = 4 + 16u + 16u2, yes.
so then: 4 + (4 + 16u + 16u2) = 8 + 16u + 16u2.
so numerator is (2 + u)(8 + 16u + 16u2).
multiply this out: = 2*8 + 2*16u + 2*16u2 + u*8 + u*16u + u*16u2
= 16 + 32u + 32u2 + 8u + 16u2 + 16u3
combine like terms: 16 + (32u +8u) + (32u2 +16u2) +16u3 =16 +40u +48u2 +16u3
so the expression becomes (16u3 +48u2 +40u +16)/u =16u2 +48u +40 +16/u
so now, we need to minimize 16u2 +48u +40 +16/u.
let’s denote this function as f(u) =16u2 +48u +40 +16/u.
to find the critical points, take derivative: f’(u) =32u +48 -16/u2.
set equal to zero:32u +48 -16/u2=0.
multiply both sides by u2:32u3 +48u2 -16=0.
divide by 16:2u3 +3u2 -1=0.
factor this cubic equation.
let me try rational roots.
possible roots are ±1, ±1/2.
let’s test u=1:2+3-1=4≠0.
u=1/2:2*(1/8) +3*(1/4) -1=0.25 +0.75 -1=0.
so u=1/2 is a root.
therefore, factor out (u -1/2).
perform polynomial division: 2u3 +3u2 -1 divided by (u -1/2).
alternatively, synthetic division: using u=1/2: coefficients:2 | 3 | 0 | -1
but maybe doing multiplication: let me write (u -1/2)(au2 + bu + c) = 2u3 +3u2 -1
equate coefficients: first, multiply out: au3 + bu2 + cu - (1/2)au2 - (1/2)bu - (1/2)c = au3 + (b - (1/2)a)u2 + (c - (1/2)b)u - (1/2)c
set equal to 2u3 +3u2 +0u -1.
so: 1. a =2
2. b - (1/2)a =3 ⇒ b -1=3 ⇒ b=4
3. c - (1/2)b =0 ⇒ c -2=0 ⇒ c=2
4. - (1/2)c =-1 ⇒ -1=-1, which is good.
therefore, the factorization is (u -1/2)(2u2 +4u +2).
simplify 2u2 +4u +2=2(u2 +2u +1)=2(u +1)^2.
therefore, the cubic factors as 2(u -1/2)(u +1)^2.
therefore, the roots are u=1/2 and u=-1 (double root).
since u is positive (as c is positive and u = c/b), we only consider u=1/2.
therefore, the critical point is at u=1/2.
let’s check if this is a minimum.
second derivative test: f’’(u)=32 +32/u3.
since u>0, 32 +32/u3 >0, so convex, so u=1/2 is a local minimum.
therefore, the minimum of f(u) occurs at u=1/2.
compute f(1/2)=16*(1/2)^2 +48*(1/2) +40 +16/(1/2)
=16*(1/4) +24 +40 +32
=4 +24 +40 +32=100
so when t=1 and u=1/2, the expression is 100.
but is this the global minimum?
wait, since f(u) approaches infinity as u approaches 0 or infinity, the cubic had a root at u=1/2, and since the second derivative is positive, yes, this is the global minimum for u>0.
therefore, in this case, when a = b, c = (1/2)b, the expression achieves a value of 100.
but does this give the actual minimum?
wait, but perhaps i made a substitution assuming a = tb, c = ub, which scaled variables such that b=1.
however, the problem is symmetric apart from the structure of the expression.
wait, actually, the original problem isn't symmetric in a, b, c.
the expression treats a and b symmetrically in some parts but c is added separately.
so maybe setting a = b is a good approach, as the expression is symmetric in a, b.
alternatively, maybe there's another combination.
but let me verify.
wait, when i set a = tb, c = ub, and i found that when t=1, u=1/2, the expression is 100.
but perhaps another substitution would lead to a lower value?
alternatively, maybe the minimum is indeed 100.
but let me check with another approach.
alternatively, use hölder's inequality.
let me recall hölder's inequality: for positive reals and exponents p, q such that 1/p +1/q=1, then sum a_i b_i <= (sum a_i^p)^{1/p} (sum b_i^q)^{1/q}}.
but here, the expression is [(a + b + c)(something)] / (abc).
alternatively, maybe split the numerator and apply am-gh.
wait, let me write the numerator again: (a + b + c)[(a + b)^2 + (a + b + 4c)^2].
let s = a + b.
then, (s + c)[s2 + (s + 4c)^2].
expand that: = (s + c)[s2 + s2 +8cs +16c2] = (s + c)(2s2 +8cs +16c2).
as before, which simplifies to 2(s + c)(s2 +4cs +8c2).
so, need to minimize [2(s + c)(s2 +4cs +8c2)] / (abc).
but s = a + b, so variables are s and c.
but a and b are positive, so a, b >0, hence s >0, c >0.
so perhaps express in terms of s and c, and then use am-gm.
alternatively, let’s set variables: let’s set s = a + b, and then abc = ab*c.
since s = a + b, ab <= (s/2)^2 by am-gm.
so maybe we can use that?
but then, since ab <= (s/2)^2, so the denominator abc <= (s/2)^2 * c.
therefore, the expression >= [2(s + c)(s2 +4cs +8c2)] / [(s/2)^2 c] = 2(s + c)(s2 +4cs +8c2) * 4 / (s2 c) = 8(s + c)(s2 +4cs +8c2)/(s2 c)
therefore, if we bound the expression in terms of s and c, then find minimal value over s and c.
but perhaps this can be minimized over s and c.
let me try.
let’s denote t = s/c.
then, let s = tc.
then t is a positive real number.
then, substituting s = tc into the expression: 8(s + c)(s2 +4cs +8c2)/(s2 c) = 8(tc + c)(t2c2 +4c*tc +8c2)/(t2c2 * c)
simplify numerator: 8*(tc + c)*(t2c2 +4tc2 +8c2) =8*c*(t +1)*c2*(t2 +4t +8) =8c3(t +1)(t2 +4t +8)
denominator: t2 c3
therefore, the expression simplifies to 8(t +1)(t2 +4t +8)/t2
therefore, the entire expression is bounded below by 8(t +1)(t2 +4t +8)/t2, and this bound is achieved when ab = (s/2)^2, i.e., when a = b.
therefore, the minimal value of the original expression is at least the minimal value of 8(t +1)(t2 +4t +8)/t2 over t >0.
therefore, now, we need to minimize the function f(t) =8(t +1)(t2 +4t +8)/t2.
let me expand this: first, expand (t +1)(t2 +4t +8): = t(t2 +4t +8) +1*(t2 +4t +8) = t3 +4t2 +8t +t2 +4t +8 = t3 +5t2 +12t +8
therefore, f(t) =8(t3 +5t2 +12t +8)/t2 =8(t +5 +12/t +8/t2) =8t +40 +96/t +64/t2
therefore, f(t) =8t +40 +96/t +64/t2.
now, to find the minimum of this function, take derivative: f’(t) =8 -96/t2 -128/t3.
set equal to zero:8 -96/t2 -128/t3=0.
multiply both sides by t3 to eliminate denominators:8t3 -96t -128=0.
divide by 8: t3 -12t -16=0.
now, let's attempt to solve t3 -12t -16=0.
looking for rational roots, tried t=2: 8 -24 -16= -32≠0.
t=4:64 -48 -16=64-64=0.
so t=4 is a root.
therefore, factor as (t -4)(...).
polynomial division: t3 -12t -16 divided by (t -4).
using synthetic division: bring down 1, multiply by 4:4
4 | 1 | 0 | -12 | -16
calculate:
first row: 1 | 0 | -12 | -16
second row: bring down 1
multiply by 4:4 | 16 | 32
add: 1+4=5; 0+4=4; -12+16=4; -16+32=16
wait, this gives: 1 |4 |4 |16
so quotient is t2 +4t +4, remainder 16.
wait, that doesn't seem right.
alternatively, maybe i did the synthetic division wrong.
wait, divisor is t -4, so root is 4.
using synthetic division:
4 | 1 | 0 | -12 | -16
bring down 1.
4*1=4
add to next coefficient 0 +4=4
4*4=16
add to -12: -12 +16=4
4*4=16
add to -16: -16 +16=0
so remainder is 0, and quotient is t2 +4t +4.
therefore, factors as (t -4)(t +2)^2.
so roots are t=4 and t=-2 (double root).
since t=s/c is positive, so only t=4 is valid.
therefore, critical point at t=4.
second derivative test: f''(t) derivative of f’(t)=8 -96/t2 -128/t3
f''(t)= 192/t3 +384/t4.
since t>0, f''(t) >0, so convex, so t=4 is a local minimum.
therefore, the minimum of f(t) is at t=4.
calculate f(4)=8*4 +40 +96/4 +64/42
compute each term: 8*4=32, 40=40, 96/4=24, 64/(4^2)=64/16=4.
so total is 32 +40 +24 +4=100.
therefore, the minimal value of the expression is 100.
wait, so when t=4, which is s/c=4, so s=4c.
since s =a +b, so a +b=4c.
also, earlier, in the hölder approach, we had the bound f(t)=8(t +1)(t2 +4t +8)/t2, which when minimized gives 100.
but in that approach, equality holds when a = b, as per the am-gm condition.
so when a = b, and s =4c, which implies a + b =4c, but a = b, so 2a =4c ⇒ a=2c, b=2c.
then c=c.
so in variables a, b, c, the equality case is a = b =2c.
let me verify this with the previous substitution where i set t=1 (a = b) and found u=1/2 (c= u*b =0.5*b), so c=0.5b, and since a =b, then a +b=2b=4c=4*0.5b=2b, which matches.
therefore, in this case, a =b=2c, so indeed, when a and b are each twice c, the expression achieves the minimum.
therefore, the minimal value is 100.
therefore, after going through substitution, homogeniety, and checking via hölder's inequality and am-gm, the minimum value is 100, achieved when a =b=2c.
therefore, the answer is \boxed{100}
</think>

answer: given positive real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), we need to find the minimum value of the expression:

\[
\frac{(a + b + c)[(a + b)^2 + (a + b + 4c)^2]}{abc}
\]

first, we recognize that the expression is homogeneous of degree 0, allowing us to use substitutions to simplify the variables. by setting \(a = b\) and \(c = \frac{1}{2}a\), we can reduce the problem to a single variable. 

let \(a = b = 2c\). then, substituting \(a = 2c\) and \(b = 2c\) into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{(2c + 2c + c)[(2c + 2c)^2 + (2c + 2c + 4c)^2]}{(2c)(2c)c}
\]

simplifying the terms inside the expression:

- \(a + b + c = 2c + 2c + c = 5c\)
- \((a + b)^2 = (4c)^2 = 16c^2\)
- \((a + b + 4c)^2 = (4c + 4c)^2 = (8c)^2 = 64c^2\)

thus, the numerator becomes:

\[
5c \left(16c^2 + 64c^2\right) = 5c \cdot 80c^2 = 400c^3
\]

the denominator is:

\[
(2c)(2c)c = 4c^3
\]

therefore, the entire expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{400c^3}{4c^3} = 100
\]

to confirm this is the minimum, we use calculus. by setting \(t = \frac{a + b}{c}\) and simplifying the expression, we derive a function in terms of \(t\) and find its critical points. solving the cubic equation \(t^3 - 12t - 16 = 0\), we find \(t = 4\) is the root, leading to the minimum value of 100.

thus, the minimum value of the given expression is:

\[
\boxed{100}
\]
