Okay, so I need to solve this problem about Sam carrying a bucket of milk from the barn to his house. Let me read through the problem again and make sure I understand it.
The setup is: Sam is carrying a 2-gallon bucket of milk.
The barn is 3 miles away from his house.
The bucket has a leak.
For each mile he walks, the amount of milk left in the bucket at the end of the mile is 2/3 of what was in the bucket at the beginning of the mile.
The question is how much milk will be left when he gets home.
Hmm, so it's a problem about exponential decay, right?
Because each mile, the amount of milk decreases by a consistent fraction.
Let me break it down step by step.
First, let's clarify the process.
When Sam starts his journey from the barn, he has 2 gallons.
He needs to walk 3 miles.
Each mile, the leak reduces the milk to 2/3 of the previous amount.
So, after each mile, the amount of milk is multiplied by 2/3.
Let me verify that interpretation.
The problem says, "for each mile he walks, there is 2/3 as much milk in the bucket as at the beginning of the mile."
So yes, if at the start of the mile he has X gallons, at the end he'll have (2/3)*X.
So it's a geometric sequence where each term is (2/3) of the previous term.
The starting amount is 2 gallons.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: Determine the milk quantity remaining after the first mile.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: Determine the milk quantity remaining after the second mile.
</Outline>
<Outline>
3: Determine the milk quantity remaining after the third mile.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The milk quantity after the first mile is calculated by multiplying the initial 2 gallons by 2/3, resulting in 4/3 gallons.
</Path>
<Path>
2: After the second mile, the milk quantity is further reduced by the leak. The remaining milk is calculated by multiplying the previous amount (4/3 gallons) by 2/3, resulting in (4/3) * (2/3) = 8/9 gallons.
</Path>
<Path>
3: The amount of milk after the third mile is calculated by multiplying the remaining quantity after the second mile, 8/9 gallons, by 2/3, resulting in (8/9) * (2/3) = 16/27 gallons.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The milk quantity after each mile is 4/3 gallons for the first mile, 8/9 gallons for the second mile, and 16/27 gallons for the third mile.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So that's 16/27 gallons.
Let me check that.
Alternatively, maybe using decimals to verify.
2 * 0.666... is approximately 1.333... (which is 4/3)
4/3 is about 1.333..., multiplied by 0.666... is about 0.888... (which is 8/9)
8/9 is about 0.888..., multiplied by 0.666... is about 0.592..., which is 16/27, since 16 divided by 27 is approximately 0.592.
So that seems correct.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: The final amount of milk after three miles, calculated using fractional multiplication.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: The final amount of milk after three miles, calculated using decimal approximation.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The final amount of milk after three miles is determined by multiplying the initial 2 gallons by (2/3) three times, which is 2 * (2/3)^3, resulting in 16/27 gallons.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The final milk quantity is also determined using decimal approximation. Starting with 2 gallons, the first mile reduces the amount to 2 * (2/3), approximately 1.333 gallons. The second mile reduces it to approximately 1.333 * 0.666, about 0.888 gallons. The third mile further reduces it to approximately 0.888 * 0.666, about 0.592 gallons, which is equivalent to 16/27 gallons.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
Both the fractional multiplication (2 * (2/3)^3 = 16/27) and the decimal approximation method (2 * 0.666... * 0.666... * 0.666... ≈ 0.592) yield the same final milk quantity of 16/27 gallons.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So 16/27 is approximately 0.592 gallons.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: Determine if the problem's phrasing implies milk loss at the start of each mile segment.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: Determine if the problem's phrasing implies milk loss at the end of each mile segment.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The problem statement specifies that "for each mile he walks, there is 2/3 as much milk in the bucket as at the beginning of the mile," indicating that the milk quantity is determined at the end of each mile based on its quantity at the beginning of that mile. This suggests that the loss occurs at the end of each mile, with the milk quantity decreasing from its initial amount at the start of the mile to two-thirds of that initial amount at the end of the mile. This interpretation leads to the conclusion that the loss is applied once per mile segment, resulting in a total of three loss applications over the three-mile journey. The calculation method of multiplying the initial quantity by (2/3) for each mile is consistent with this interpretation.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The phrase "for each mile he walks, there is 2/3 as much milk in the bucket as at the beginning of the mile" suggests that the milk quantity at the end of each mile is 2/3 of the beginning quantity for that mile, implying a loss at the end of each mile segment.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The problem's wording, "for each mile he walks, there is 2/3 as much milk in the bucket as at the beginning of the mile," is interpreted as meaning that at the end of each mile, the milk quantity is 2/3 of its amount at the start of that mile. This implies that the milk loss occurs at the end of each mile segment, and this interpretation is consistent with the calculation method of multiplying the initial quantity by (2/3) for each mile walked.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
But let's think: does the leak happen gradually during the mile, or is it like a sudden loss at the end of each mile?
The problem states that "for each mile he walks, there is 2/3 as much milk...," which suggests that after each mile, the milk reduces.
So regardless of whether he's walking for a mile, the reduction is only applied once per mile.
So the answer is 16/27 gallons.
Alternatively, if it was continuous leakage, it would be a different model, maybe with exponential decay using e, but the problem specifies that each mile, it's 2/3, so it's discrete, per mile.
So it's just multiplying by 2/3 three times.
Yes, so that's 2*(2/3)^3 = 2*(8/27) = 16/27.
Therefore, the answer is 16/27.
Wait, but let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the question.
Let's re-express: At the beginning of the first mile, he has 2 gallons.
After the first mile, it's 2*(2/3).
At the beginning of the second mile, he has 4/3 gallons, then after the second mile, it's 8/9.
At the beginning of the third mile, 8/9 gallons, after the third mile, 16/27.
So yes, when he gets home, which is after three miles, he has 16/27 gallons.
Alternatively, is distance measured from the barn?
He's going from the barn (3 miles away) to his house.
So starting at the barn (0 miles from home), then walking 3 miles to the house.
But the key is that each mile brings a reduction.
So the first mile would bring him from the barn to 1 mile away from home, then the second mile brings him 2 miles away, and the third mile brings him to the house.
But regardless, each of those miles has a reduction.
So regardless of how you model the distance, the reductions are per mile, so after three reductions, the answer is 16/27.
Alternatively, perhaps the problem is similar to compound interest, but in this case, it's a decay factor.
Each mile is like a period, and the decay factor is 2/3 each period.
So present value (initial amount) is 2, decay factor per period (mile) is 2/3, number of periods is 3.
So final amount is 2*(2/3)^3 = 16/27.
So that's correct.
Alternatively, maybe some people would misinterpret it as subtracting 1/3 per mile, but the problem says "there is 2/3 as much milk", meaning it's multiplied by 2/3, not subtracting 1/3.
For example, first mile: 2 - 2/3 = 4/3.
Wait, no, the problem says "there is 2/3 as much milk in the bucket as at the beginning of the mile."
So it's a scaling, not a subtraction.
So first mile: (2/3)*2 = 4/3, which is correct.
If instead, you subtract 1/3 of the original 2 gallons each mile, that would be wrong.
So it's important to parse the wording.
So "for each mile he walks, there is 2/3 as much milk in the bucket as at the beginning of the mile."
So at the end of the mile, the amount is equal to 2/3 times the amount at the beginning of that mile.
So that's a multiplicative factor.
So yes, each mile is multiplied by 2/3.
So starting with 2, after 1 mile: 2*(2/3).
After two miles: 2*(2/3)^2.
After three miles: 2*(2/3)^3 = 16/27.
So that's the answer.
Alternatively, let's check unit analysis.
The answer should be in gallons.
The initial amount is 2 gallons.
Each (2/3) is unitless, a fraction.
So multiplying 2 gallons by (2/3)^3 gives gallons, which is correct.
So 16/27 gallons is approximately 0.592 gallons.
Since 27 goes into 16 zero times, 27*0.592 is about 16.
So that's reasonable.
Alternatively, 27/16 = 1.6875, but reciprocal is not needed here.
Alternatively, converting to decimal, 16 divided by 27.
27*0.5 = 13.5, 16 - 13.5 = 2.5.
So 2.5/27 ≈ 0.0925.
So total is approximately 0.5925, so ~0.59 gallons.
But since the question asks for a fraction, 16/27 is likely the answer.
Alternatively, maybe there's a trick here, but I don't think so.
The problem is straightforward exponential decay with a decay factor of 2/3 per mile, over 3 miles.
So 2*(2/3)^3 is indeed 16/27.
Alternatively, some might think that after the first mile, he has 2/3 + 2/3 remaining, but that would be incorrect because the problem states that the entire amount is reduced to 2/3 of the previous amount.
So for each mile, whatever is left is multiplied by 2/3.
So after first mile: 2*(2/3).
Then, for the second mile, you take that result and multiply by 2/3 again.
So, yes, 2*(2/3)^3.
So the answer is 16/27 gallons.
So I'm confident with that.
**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{16}{27}}
</Think>

Answer: Sam starts with 2 gallons of milk and needs to walk 3 miles home. For each mile he walks, the amount of milk left in the bucket at the end of the mile is \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the amount at the beginning of the mile. 

To determine the amount of milk left after each mile:
1. **After the first mile:** The milk left is \(2 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{4}{3}\) gallons.
2. **After the second mile:** The milk left is \(\frac{4}{3} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{9}\) gallons.
3. **After the third mile:** The milk left is \(\frac{8}{9} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{16}{27}\) gallons.

Thus, the final amount of milk in the bucket when Sam gets home is \(\frac{16}{27}\) gallons.

\[
\boxed{\dfrac{16}{27}}
