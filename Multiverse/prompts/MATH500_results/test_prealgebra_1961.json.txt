Okay, so Sam is carrying a 2-gallon bucket of milk from the barn to his house, which is 3 miles away. The problem is that the bucket has a leak. For each mile he walks, the amount of milk left in the bucket is (2/3) of what was in the bucket at the beginning of that mile. I need to figure out how much milk will be left when he gets home.
Let me make sure I understand this correctly. The leak depends on each mile, right? So the milk left after each mile is multiplied by 2/3. So it's a successive reduction. Let's think in parallel.

<Outline>

1: The initial quantity of milk is 2 gallons. After walking the first mile, the milk quantity is reduced to (2/3) of its original amount, which is calculated as (2/3) * 2, resulting in 4/3 gallons.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The milk quantity at the start of the second mile is 4/3 gallons. After walking this mile, the milk quantity becomes (4/3) * (2/3) = 8/9 gallons.
</Path>
<Path>
3: The milk quantity after the third mile is calculated by multiplying the quantity after the second mile, 8/9 gallons, by 2/3. This multiplication, (8/9) * (2/3), equals 16/27 gallons.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The milk quantity diminishes with each mile, decreasing to 4/3 gallons after the first mile, 8/9 gallons after the second mile, and finally 16/27 gallons after the third mile.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So after the first mile, he has 4/3 gallons left.
After the second mile, he has (4/3)*(2/3) = 8/9 gallons.
After the third mile, he has (8/9)*(2/3) = 16/27 gallons.
Let me verify that calculation step by step.
Start: 2 gallons.

So that seems right. Alternatively, since each time it's multiplied by 2/3, maybe you can model this as an exponential decay. So the formula would be initial amount * (2/3)^n, where n is the number of miles. Wait, but does this apply here? Wait, in this case, is n the number of miles?
Let's think in parallel.

So that would mean after 3 miles, the amount left is 2*(2/3)^3. Let's compute that.
2*(2/3)^3 = 2*(8/27) = 16/27. Same answer. So both methods lead to 16/27 gallons.
Wait, so why did I get the same result? So even though the problem states "for each mile he walks, there is 2/3 as much milk in the bucket as at the beginning of the mile," the effect is cumulative, so it is indeed (2/3)^n * initial. So maybe the problem can be modeled exponentially.
But perhaps the key here is that each mile is a discrete step, so after each mile, the amount is multiplied by 2/3. So over three miles, it's (2/3)^3. So starting with 2 gallons, so 2*(2/3)^3 = 16/27. So that's consistent with step-by-step calculation.
Let me see another way. Suppose after mile 1: 2 * (2/3) = 4/3.
Then after mile 2: 4/3 * (2/3) = 8/9.
After mile 3: 8/9 * (2/3) = 16/27. Yep, same as 2*(2/3)^3. So either way, the answer is 16/27.
So is there a trick here or is it straightforward? The problem could have perhaps tried to trick me into thinking that it's a continuous decay, but since it's specified that each mile it's 2/3 as before, so discrete steps, so the answer is (2/3)^3 *2=16/27. So I think that is correct.
Let me check another way. Let's see if the bucket is losing milk at a rate such that each mile only 2/3 remains. So similar to compound interest, but decay. So each period (mile) you multiply by 2/3. So after n = 3 periods, it's 2*(2/3)^3. Which is 2*(8/27)=16/27. So same answer.
Alternatively, if it was continuous decay, it would be different, but since it's discrete (mile by mile), with a fixed ratio each time, it's discrete.
Alternatively, another way to visualize: starting with 2 gallons.

So 16/27 is approximately 0.592 gallons. Just seems right because each time it's losing a third of the milk. So after first mile, about 1.333 - losing a third (so 0.666 left, which is 0.666*2=1.333? Wait no.
Wait, no: If you start with 2 gallons, after first mile, you have (2/3)*2=4/3≈1.333. Then the second mile, you have (2/3)*(4/3)=8/9≈0.888..., then third mile (2/3)*(8/9)=16/27≈0.592. So each time decreasing, yes. So that seems correct.
Alternatively, maybe some people would misinterpret the problem as losing (1 - 2/3) = 1/3 of the milk per mile, so subtract 2/3 each time, but that would be different. But the problem says "there is 2/3 as much milk in the bucket as at the beginning of the mile." So if at the beginning of the mile he had A gallons, at the end he has (2/3)*A. So that's multiplicative, not subtracting. So the answer is 16/27.
Wait, another potential confusion: the problem says "for each mile he walks, there is 2/3 as much milk in the bucket as at the beginning of the mile." So does the leak happen after each mile? Like, after each full mile, the milk reduces to 2/3 of the previous amount. Wait, so maybe when he starts the first mile, he starts with 2 gallons, but after completing the first mile, he has (2/3)*2. Then starting the second mile with 4/3, and after completing it, he has (2/3)*(4/3), etc. So in that case, since there are three miles, each with their own 2/3 reduction. So that's the case. So that's compounded three times, so (2/3)^3 multiplied by initial.
So yes, seems correct.
Alternatively, some might think that over the course of each mile, the milk is decreasing continuously such that at the end of the mile, it's 2/3 of the beginning. But even if it were continuous, the overall result after three miles would still be (2/3)^3 if the decay rate is constant. However, since the problem is phrased per mile, with discrete steps, (2/3) per mile, so the answer is 16/27.
I don't see any other interpretation. So unless I miscalculated the exponent, but 2*(2/3)^3 is indeed 2*(8/27)=16/27. So that's correct.
Therefore, the final answer is 16/27.
**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{16}{27}}
</Think>

Answer: Sam is carrying a 2-gallon bucket of milk from the barn to his house, which is 3 miles away. The bucket has a leak, and for each mile he walks, the amount of milk left in the bucket is \(\frac{2}{3}\) of what was in the bucket at the beginning of the mile. 

To determine how much milk will be left after each mile:
1. **After the first mile**: The milk left is \(\frac{2}{3} \times 2 = \frac{4}{3}\) gallons.
2. **After the second mile**: The milk left is \(\frac{2}{3} \times \frac{4}{3} = \frac{8}{9}\) gallons.
3. **After the third mile**: The milk left is \(\frac{2}{3} \times \frac{8}{9} = \frac{16}{27}\) gallons.

This can also be calculated using the formula for exponential decay:
\[ 2 \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 = 2 \times \frac{8}{27} = \frac{16}{27} \]

Thus, the final amount of milk in the bucket when Sam gets home is \(\boxed{\dfrac{16}{27}}\) gallons.

the final answer is \boxed{\dfrac{16}{27}}

</think>

answer: sam is carrying a 2-gallon bucket of milk from the barn to his house, which is 3 miles away. the bucket has a leak, and for each mile he walks, the amount of milk left in the bucket is \(\frac{2}{3}\) of what was in the bucket at the beginning of the mile. 

to determine how much milk will be left after each mile:
1. **after the first mile**: the milk left is \(\frac{2}{3} \times 2 = \frac{4}{3}\) gallons.
2. **after the second mile**: the milk left is \(\frac{2}{3} \times \frac{4}{3} = \frac{8}{9}\) gallons.
3. **after the third mile**: the milk left is \(\frac{2}{3} \times \frac{8}{9} = \frac{16}{27}\) gallons.

this can also be calculated using the formula for exponential decay:
\[ 2 \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 = 2 \times \frac{8}{27} = \frac{16}{27} \]

thus, the final amount of milk in the bucket when sam gets home is \(\boxed{\dfrac{16}{27}}\) gallons.

the final answer is \boxed{\dfrac{16}{27}}
