Okay, so I need to find the value of 'a' that makes the graph of the function f(n) continuous.
The function is defined piecewise: it's 4n + 3 when n is less than a, and 7n - 12 when n is greater than or equal to a.
For the graph to be continuous, the two pieces of the function have to meet smoothly at n = a.
That means there shouldn't be a jump or a gap at that point.
To ensure continuity at n = a, the limit of f(n) as n approaches a from the left should be equal to the limit as n approaches a from the right, and both should be equal to f(a).
Since the function is defined differently for n < a and n ≥ a, I need to check the left-hand limit (approaching a from the left, so using 4n + 3) and the right-hand limit (approaching a from the right, so using 7n - 12).
Then set them equal to each other and solve for a.
First, the left-hand limit as n approaches a is 4a + 3.
Wait, actually, when n approaches a from the left (n → a-), since n is less than a, the function is 4n + 3.
So substituting a into that expression gives 4a + 3.
Similarly, the right-hand limit as n approaches a is 7a - 12.
Because when n is approaching a from the right (n → a+), n is now in the domain where n ≥ a, so the function is 7n - 12.
Substituting n = a gives 7a - 12.
For continuity, these two limits must be equal.
Therefore, 4a + 3 = 7a - 12.
That's the key equation I need to solve for a.
Let me write that down: 4a + 3 = 7a - 12.
Now, solving for a.
First, I'll subtract 4a from both sides.
That gives: 3 = 3a - 12.
Then add 12 to both sides: 15 = 3a.
Divide both sides by 3: a = 5.
Wait, so a is 5?
Let me check that again.
Starting with 4a + 3 = 7a - 12.
Subtract 4a from both sides: 3 = 7a - 4a -12.
So 3 = 3a -12.
Then, adding 12 to both sides: 3 + 12 = 3a.
15 = 3a.
Divide by 3: a = 5.
Yes, that's right.
So at a = 5, the left limit and right limit are both equal to the same value, which is also f(5).
Let me verify that.
If a = 5, then f(5) is defined by the second piece since n ≥ 5: 7*5 -12 = 35 -12 = 23.
Now, the left-hand limit as n approaches 5 would be 4*5 + 3 = 20 + 3 = 23.
So both sides meet at 23 when a =5.
Therefore, the function is continuous at n=5 when a=5.
That makes sense.
So the answer should be 5.
I think that's correct.
Let me see if there's another way to check.
Alternatively, sometimes with piecewise functions, if you want them to be continuous at the breakpoint, you set the two expressions equal at that breakpoint.
So here, the breakpoint is n=a, so set 4a +3 (from the left) equal to 7a -12 (from the right), which gives the equation 7a -12 =4a +3.
Then solving that gives 7a -4a =12 +3 -> 3a=15 -> a=5.
Yep, same result.
No matter, getting the same answer through reasoning.
So I'm confident with a=5.

The function \( f(n) \) is defined piecewise as \( 4n + 3 \) for \( n < a \) and \( 7n - 12 \) for \( n \ge a \). To ensure continuity at \( n = a \), the left-hand limit (approaching \( a \) from the left using \( 4n + 3 \)) must equal the right-hand limit (approaching \( a \) from the right using \( 7n - 12 \)). Setting these equal gives the equation \( 4a + 3 = 7a - 12 \). Solving for \( a \):

\[
4a + 3 = 7a - 12
\]

Subtract \( 4a \) from both sides:

\[
3 = 3a - 12
\]

Add 12 to both sides:

\[
15 = 3a
\]

Divide by 3:

\[
a = 5
\]

Verification shows that at \( a = 5 \), both the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit equal 23, confirming continuity. Thus, the value of \( a \) is \(\boxed{5}\).

Answer: To ensure the function \( f(n) \) is continuous at \( n = a \), we need the left-hand limit (as \( n \) approaches \( a \) from the left) to be equal to the right-hand limit (as \( n \) approaches \( a \) from the right). 

The function \( f(n) \) is defined as:
\[
f(n) =
\begin{cases}
4n + 3 & \text{if } n < a, \\
7n - 12 & \text{if } n \ge a.
\end{cases}
\]

1. The left-hand limit as \( n \) approaches \( a \) is given by the expression for \( n < a \):
   \[
   \lim_{{n \to a^-}} f(n) = 4a + 3
   \]

2. The right-hand limit as \( n \) approaches \( a \) is given by the expression for \( n \ge a \):
   \[
   \lim_{{n \to a^+}} f(n) = 7a - 12
   \]

For continuity, these two limits must be equal:
\[
4a + 3 = 7a - 12
\]

Solving for \( a \):
\[
4a + 3 = 7a - 12
\]
Subtract \( 4a \) from both sides:
\[
3 = 3a - 12
\]
Add 12 to both sides:
\[
15 = 3a
\]
Divide by 3:
\[
a = 5
\]

Verification shows that at \( a = 5 \), both the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit equal 23, confirming continuity. Thus, the value of \( a \) is \(\boxed{5}\).

the final answer is \boxed{5}
