Okay, so I have this piecewise function f(n) defined as 4n + 3 when n is less than a, and 7n - 12 when n is greater than or equal to a.
The problem says the graph is continuous, and I need to find the value of a.
Hmm, continuity at piecewise functions.

The function value f(a) is 7a - 12. The left-hand limit as n approaches a is 4a + 3. The right-hand limit as n approaches a is 7a - 12.

So for continuity, these two expressions, 4a + 3 and 7a - 12, must be equal to each other.
Because if they aren't equal, there's a jump discontinuity at n = a.
Therefore, setting them equal:
4a + 3 = 7a - 12
Let me solve this equation for a.
First, subtract 4a from both sides:
3 = 3a - 12
Then add 12 to both sides:
15 = 3a
Divide both sides by 3:
a = 5

Wait, this contradicts the earlier calculation where solving 4a + 3 = 7a -12 gave a=5.
But when a=5, f(a) should be 7*5 -12 =23, but the limit from the right is 25, which is not equal.
This discontinuity seems to indicate a mistake in my earlier reasoning.
Wait, hold on.
Wait, maybe I misunderstood the definition.
Let me read the problem again.
"Find a if the graph of y=f(n) is continuous."
The function is defined as 4n +3 for n < a, and 7n -12 for n ≥ a.
So at n = a, the function is defined by the second piece, which is 7a -12.
But for continuity, the limit as n approaches a from the left (4n +3) must equal the limit as n approaches a from the right (7n -12), and both must equal f(a) =7a -12.
However, when I solved 4a +3 =7a -12, I got a=5.
But when I substitute a=5 back in, the left hand limit is 4*5 +3=23, the right hand limit is 7*5 -12=23.
Wait, hold on, 7*5 is 35, minus 12 is 23.
So right hand limit is 23.
Then f(a) is also 23.
So they are equal.
Wait, I must have miscalculated before.
Let me check again.
When n approaches a from the right (using 7n -12), substituting n =a gives 7a -12.
So if a=5, then 7*5 -12=35 -12=23.
Similarly, from the left, 4a +3=4*5 +3=20 +3=23.
So 23=23=23.
Therefore, continuity is satisfied.
So a=5 is correct.
So why was there confusion earlier?
Maybe because when I first calculated it in my mind, I might have made an error.
But according to the math, when a=5, both sides approach 23, and the function value at a=5 is 23.
Therefore, it is continuous.
Therefore, the answer should be a=5.
Wait, maybe the confusion before was due to not substituting correctly.

Wait, wait, hold on.
Now I'm confused again.
Wait, if n approaches 5 from the right, i.e., n >5, then f(n)=7n -12.
So the right-hand limit as n approaches 5 is 7*5 -12=23.
Similarly, left-hand limit as n approaches 5 is 4*5 +3=23.
And f(5)=7*5 -12=23.
Therefore, it is continuous.
So why earlier I thought there was a problem?
Maybe I mistakenly thought that the right-hand limit is 7*(5) -12=35-12=23, which is correct, but earlier I calculated 7*5 -12 as 25, which is wrong.
Wait, 7*5 is 35, minus 12 is 23.
So that was incorrect.
So the correct calculation gives 23.
Therefore, all three values are 23.
Therefore, continuous.
So the answer is a=5.
So the value of a is 5.
Therefore, the final answer is 5.
Wait, but the previous calculation where solving 4a +3=7a -12 gives a=5 is correct.
Then substituting back in, all limits are 23, which are equal.
Therefore, the function is continuous.
So the final answer is 5.
**Final Answer** 
\boxed{5}
</Think>

Answer: To find the value of \( a \) that makes the graph of \( y = f(n) \) continuous, we need to ensure that the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit of \( f(n) \) at \( n = a \) are equal to the function value at \( n = a \).

The function \( f(n) \) is defined as:
\[
f(n) =
\begin{cases}
4n + 3 & \text{if } n < a, \\
7n - 12 & \text{if } n \ge a.
\end{cases}
\]

For continuity at \( n = a \):
1. The left-hand limit as \( n \) approaches \( a \) (from the left) is \( 4a + 3 \).
2. The right-hand limit as \( n \) approaches \( a \) (from the right) is \( 7a - 12 \).
3. The function value at \( n = a \) is \( 7a - 12 \).

To ensure continuity, we set the left-hand limit equal to the right-hand limit:
\[
4a + 3 = 7a - 12
\]

Solving for \( a \):
\[
4a + 3 = 7a - 12
\]
\[
3 = 3a - 12
\]
\[
15 = 3a
\]
\[
a = 5
\]

Verification:
- Left-hand limit as \( n \) approaches 5: \( 4(5) + 3 = 23 \)
- Right-hand limit as \( n \) approaches 5: \( 7(5) - 12 = 23 \)
- Function value at \( n = 5 \): \( 7(5) - 12 = 23 \)

All three values are equal, confirming continuity at \( n = 5 \).

The final answer is \(\boxed{5}\).

\boxed{5}
</think>

answer: to find the value of \( a \) that makes the graph of \( y = f(n) \) continuous, we need to ensure that the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit of \( f(n) \) at \( n = a \) are equal to the function value at \( n = a \).

the function \( f(n) \) is defined as:
\[
f(n) =
\begin{cases}
4n + 3 & \text{if } n < a, \\
7n - 12 & \text{if } n \ge a.
\end{cases}
\]

for continuity at \( n = a \):
1. the left-hand limit as \( n \) approaches \( a \) (from the left) is \( 4a + 3 \).
2. the right-hand limit as \( n \) approaches \( a \) (from the right) is \( 7a - 12 \).
3. the function value at \( n = a \) is \( 7a - 12 \).

to ensure continuity, we set the left-hand limit equal to the right-hand limit:
\[
4a + 3 = 7a - 12
\]

solving for \( a \):
\[
4a + 3 = 7a - 12
\]
\[
3 = 3a - 12
\]
\[
15 = 3a
\]
\[
a = 5
\]

verification:
- left-hand limit as \( n \) approaches 5: \( 4(5) + 3 = 23 \)
- right-hand limit as \( n \) approaches 5: \( 7(5) - 12 = 23 \)
- function value at \( n = 5 \): \( 7(5) - 12 = 23 \)

all three values are equal, confirming continuity at \( n = 5 \).

the final answer is \(\boxed{5}\)
