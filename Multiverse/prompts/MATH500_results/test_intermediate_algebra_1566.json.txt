Okay, so I have this problem about parabolas and reflecting them over a line.
The original parabola has the equation \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \) and its vertex is at \( (h, k) \).
When this parabola is reflected about the line \( y = k \), the resulting parabola has the equation \( y = dx^2 + ex + f \).
I need to find an expression for \( a + b + c + d + e + f \) in terms of \( k \).
Hmm, let's start by recalling some properties of parabolas and reflections.
First, the vertex of the original parabola is \( (h, k) \).
So, the equation can also be written in vertex form: \( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \).
Maybe it's easier to work with the vertex form because the vertex is explicitly given.
Then, reflecting over the line \( y = k \).
Reflection over a horizontal line—how does that affect the equation?
Let me think.
When you reflect a point \( (x, y) \) over the line \( y = k \), the reflected point should be \( (x, 2k - y) \).
So, the reflection of any point on the original parabola over \( y = k \) would be \( (x, 2k - y) \).
Therefore, if the original parabola has equation \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \), then after reflection, each original y-coordinate becomes \( 2k - y \).
So the equation of the reflected parabola should be \( 2k - y = ax^2 + bx + c \).
Solving for y, we get \( y = -ax^2 - bx + (2k - c) \).
Therefore, the reflected parabola is \( y = (-a)x^2 + (-b)x + (2k - c) \).
So, comparing with \( y = dx^2 + ex + f \), that would mean \( d = -a \), \( e = -b \), and \( f = 2k - c \).
So then, \( a + b + c + d + e + f = a + b + c + (-a) + (-b) + (2k - c) \).
Simplifying, the a's cancel out, the b's cancel out, and for c, we have \( c - c = 0 \).
So all that's left is 2k.
So the answer is \( 2k \).
But let me confirm this step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.
Let's go through it again.
Original equation: \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \).
Reflect over \( y = k \).
Each y-coordinate becomes \( 2k - y \).
So substituting, \( 2k - y' = ax^2 + bx + c \), where \( y' \) is the new y-coordinate after reflection.
Then solving for \( y' \), we get \( y' = -ax^2 - bx - c + 2k \).
Therefore, the new equation is \( y = -ax^2 - bx + (2k - c) \).
So coefficients are: d = -a, e = -b, f = 2k - c.
Then adding up a + b + c + d + e + f:
a + (-a) + b + (-b) + c + (2k - c) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 2k = 2k.
Yes, that makes sense.
Alternatively, maybe using the vertex form.
Original parabola: vertex at (h, k).
Equation is \( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \).
Reflect over y = k.
Reflecting over the vertex's own y-coordinate.
Since the vertex is on the line y = k, reflecting the parabola over this line would invert it.
So if the original parabola opens upward, the reflection would open downward, and vice versa.
The vertex remains the same.
Wait, but in this case, reflection over y = k would map the vertex (h, k) to itself, right?
Because it's reflecting over the horizontal line that passes through the vertex.
Therefore, the reflected parabola would have the same vertex (h, k), but the coefficient a would change sign.
So original equation: \( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \).
Reflected equation: \( y = -a(x - h)^2 + k \).
But expanding this out, let's check.
Original: \( y = a(x^2 - 2hx + h^2) + k = ax^2 - 2ahx + (ah^2 + k) \).
So, comparing to \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \), we have:
a = a,
b = -2ah,
c = ah^2 + k.
Reflected equation: \( y = -a(x - h)^2 + k = -a(x^2 - 2hx + h^2) + k = -ax^2 + 2ahx + (-ah^2 + k) \).
So comparing to \( y = dx^2 + ex + f \), we have:
d = -a,
e = 2ah,
f = -ah^2 + k.
Then, adding up a + b + c + d + e + f:
a + (-2ah) + (ah^2 + k) + (-a) + (2ah) + (-ah^2 + k)
Let's compute term by term:
a - 2ah + ah^2 + k - a + 2ah - ah^2 + k
Grouping like terms:
a - a = 0
-2ah + 2ah = 0
ah^2 - ah^2 = 0
k + k = 2k
So yes, the total sum is 2k.
Therefore, regardless of the approach—whether using the general form or vertex form—the result is the same.
So the answer should be \( 2k \).
**Final Answer**
\boxed{2k}

Answer: The original parabola has the equation \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \) with vertex \((h, k)\). Reflecting this parabola about the line \( y = k \) results in the equation \( 2k - y = ax^2 + bx + c \). Solving for \( y \), we get the reflected parabola's equation as \( y = -ax^2 - bx + (2k - c) \). 

Comparing coefficients, the reflected parabola \( y = dx^2 + ex + f \) has \( d = -a \), \( e = -b \), and \( f = 2k - c \). 

To find \( a + b + c + d + e + f \):
\[
a + b + c + (-a) + (-b) + (2k - c) = a - a + b - b + c - c + 2k = 0 + 0 + 0 + 2k = 2k
\]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{2k}\).
