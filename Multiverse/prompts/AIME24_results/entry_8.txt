Okay, so I have this problem here: There are real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy. Hmm, let me try to break this down.
First, let's write down the given equations: 1. \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\) 2. \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\) And we need to find \(xy\). Let me recall some logarithmic identities that might help here. Remember that \(\log_b(a^c) = c \log_b(a)\). So maybe I can simplify these expressions using that.
Let's think in parallel.

2: Simplify the second logarithmic equation, log_y(x^{4y}) = 10.

<Path>
1: Starting with the first equation: \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\). Applying the power rule, this becomes \(x \log_x(y) = 10\). Then, dividing both sides by x, we get \(\log_x(y) = \frac{10}{x}\).
</Path>
<Path>
2: Moving on to the second equation: \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\). Similarly, using the power rule: \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 4y \log_y(x)\). So, 4y log_y(x) = 10. Therefore, log_y(x) = 10 / (4y) = 5 / (2y).
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The first equation simplifies to log_x(y) = 10/x. The second equation simplifies to log_y(x) = 5/(2y).
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
But wait, log_y(x) is the reciprocal of log_x(y), right? Because if log_x(y) = m, then log_y(x) = 1/m. Let me verify that. Yeah, because if log_x(y) = m, then x^m = y. Therefore, y^{1/m} = x, which means log_y(x) = 1/m. So that relationship holds.
Therefore, from the first equation, log_x(y) = 10/x, so log_y(x) should be x/10. But from the second equation, log_y(x) = 5/(2y). Therefore, setting them equal: x/10 = 5/(2y). Let me write that as an equation: x/10 = 5/(2y). Then, solving for x in terms of y, maybe. Cross-multiplying gives: 2y * x = 5 * 10. 2xy = 50, so xy = 25. Wait, is that possible? So if xy = 25, then that would be the answer. But let me check if that works with both equations. Wait, the problem says "find xy," and maybe it's that straightforward? Let me check. Wait, let's not jump the gun. Let's go through the steps methodically. So we have two equations: 1. \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\) which simplifies to \(\log_x(y) = \frac{10}{x}\) 2. \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\) which simplifies to \(\log_y(x) = \frac{5}{2y}\) And we know that \(\log_x(y) = \frac{1}{\log_y(x)}\), so substituting: \(\frac{10}{x} = \frac{1}{\frac{5}{2y}}\) Which simplifies to: \(\frac{10}{x} = \frac{2y}{5}\) Cross-multiplying: 10 * 5 = 2y * x 50 = 2xy Divide both sides by 2: 25 = xy. Therefore, xy = 25. Hmm, so yes, that's consistent. So then xy = 25. Therefore, the answer is 25. But let me verify this. Let me suppose that xy = 25. Let me check if both original equations hold. Let me express y as 25/x, since xy = 25. Then, let's substitute into the first equation: \(\log_x(y^x) = \log_x\left(\left(\frac{25}{x}\right)^x\right)\). Let's compute that. \(\left(\frac{25}{x}\right)^x = 25^x / x^x\). Therefore, \(\log_x(25^x / x^x)\). Which is the same as \(\log_x\left((25 / x)^x\right)\). Which is x times log_x(25 / x). Which is x * (log_x(25) - log_x(x)) = x * (log_x(25) - 1). But log_x(25) is the logarithm of 25 with base x. Let's think in parallel.

2: The expression x * (log_x(25) - 1) is simplified using the result log_x(25) = 2. The simplification proceeds as x * (2 - 1) = x * 1 = x. This outcome implies that log_x(y^x) = x. However, the problem statement specifies that log_x(y^x) equals 10. This leads to the equation x = 10.

The logarithm log_x(25) is determined to be 2 log_x(5). The expression x * (log_x(25) - 1) simplifies to x, which, according to the problem statement, must equal 10, thereby establishing the equation x = 10.

So if x = 10, then y = 25 / x = 25 / 10 = 2.5. Wait, so y = 5/2. But the problem states that both x and y are greater than 1, so that's okay. But let me check the second equation: \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\). Substitute x = 10 and y = 5/2. Compute \(\log_{5/2}(10^{4*(5/2)})\). 4*(5/2) = 10. So that's \(\log_{2.5}(10^{10})\). Let's compute that. Let me convert this logarithm to base 10. Let's think in parallel.

1: The change of base formula is applied to log_{2.5}(10^10), yielding (log(10^10) / log(2.5)). This expression simplifies to (10 log(10) / log(2.5)). Since log(10) equals 1, the expression further simplifies to 10 / log(2.5). The value of log(2.5) is approximately 0.39794. Consequently, 10 / 0.39794 is approximately 25.16. This result contradicts the problem's requirement that the value equals 10.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The equation (2.5)^m = 10^10 is considered. Taking the logarithm of both sides yields m log(2.5) = 10 log(10), which simplifies to m = 10 / log(2.5). Since log(2.5) is log(5/2), this can be expressed as m = 10 / (log(5) - log(2)). The problem specifies that log_{2.5}(10^10) should equal 10. This implies that m should be 10, leading to the equation 10 / (log(5) - log(2)) = 10. This equation simplifies to log(5) - log(2) = 1.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The change of base calculation for log_{2.5}(10^10) yields approximately 25.16, which does not equal 10. The attempt to verify this value by solving the exponential equation (2.5)^m = 10^10 also implies m should be 10, but this leads to the contradiction log(5) - log(2) = 1, which is false.

Wait, that can't be. Wait, but according to the problem, substituting x=10 and y=2.5 should satisfy both equations. But when we check, the first equation works because x =10, but the second gives log_{2.5}(10^10) ≈25.16≠10. So something's wrong here. That suggests that our earlier approach might have been flawed. Wait, but how? Let me retrace. So we had: From the first equation: log_x(y) =10/x. From the second equation: log_y(x)=5/(2y). Then we know that log_x(y) and log_y(x) are reciprocals. Therefore, (10/x) * (5/(2y)) should be 1, because log_x(y)*log_y(x)=1. Wait, but if log_x(y)=10/x and log_y(x)=5/(2y), then their product is (10/x)*(5/(2y))= (50)/(2xy)=25/(xy). But since their product must be 1, then 25/(xy)=1, so xy=25. Therefore, regardless of the values of x and y, as long as those logarithmic conditions are met, their product must be 25. Therefore, even though substituting x=10 and y=25/10=2.5 seems to not satisfy the second equation, perhaps our manual check is wrong. Wait, perhaps my calculation of log_{2.5}(10^10) is incorrect. Wait, if x=10 and y=25/10=2.5, then from the first equation, log_x(y) = log_10(2.5) ≈0.3979, and 10/x=10/10=1. But 0.3979≈0.4≠1. So that already doesn't satisfy the first equation. Wait, what? This is confusing. Wait, maybe my approach is correct but my manual verification is wrong. Wait, according to the first equation: log_x(y^x) =10. Which is equivalent to x*log_x(y)=10. Therefore, log_x(y)=10/x. So if x=10, then log_x(y)=log_{10}(y)=10/10=1. Therefore, y=10^1=10. But then y=10, so xy=10*10=100. But earlier we had xy=25. Contradiction. Wait, this is a problem. So where is the mistake here. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me go back step by step. Original first equation: \(\log_x(y^x) =10\). By the logarithm power rule, this is x * \log_x(y) =10. Therefore, \(\log_x(y)=10/x\). Original second equation: \(\log_y(x^{4y})=10\). Similarly, 4y * \log_y(x)=10. Therefore, \(\log_y(x)=10/(4y)=5/(2y)\). Now, since \(\log_y(x)\) is the reciprocal of \(\log_x(y)\), so \(\log_y(x)=1/\log_x(y)\). Therefore, substituting: 5/(2y) = 1/(10/x) => 5/(2y) = x/10. Then, cross-multiplying: 5 * 10 = 2y * x => 50=2xy => xy=25. Therefore, regardless of individual values of x and y, their product is 25. Therefore, even if x=5, then y=5, but both x and y must be greater than 1. However, in that case, let's check if x=5, y=5. Then xy=25. Check the first equation: \(\log_5(5^5)\). log_5(5^5)=5, but the equation says it should be 10. So that's not correct. So x and y cannot be 5. Hmm. So then, what's going on here? If xy=25, then x and y must satisfy that. Let me express y as 25/x and substitute back into the expressions. From the first equation: \(\log_x(y^x)=\log_x\left(\left(\frac{25}{x}\right)^x\right) = \log_x\left(\frac{25^x}{x^x}\right) = \log_x(25^x) - \log_x(x^x) = x \log_x(25) - x = x(\log_x(25) - 1)\). But this is supposed to equal 10. So: x(\log_x(25) - 1) =10. Let me let log_x(25) = m. Then, x(m - 1) =10. But since log_x(25)=m, then x^m =25. So x=25^{1/m}. Substitute x into the equation: 25^{1/m}(m - 1) =10. This seems a bit complicated. Let me see if I can solve for m. Let me write it as: 25^{1/m} =10/(m -1). Then, take both sides to the power of m: 25 = \left(\frac{10}{m-1}\right)^m. This equation in terms of m might be difficult to solve algebraically. Maybe we can find m numerically? But the problem asks only for the product xy, which we've found is 25. The individual values of x and y might not be integers, but their product is 25. Therefore, even though x and y are some real numbers (not specified to be integers), their product is 25. So the answer is 25. Then why did our earlier check with x=10, y=2.5 not work? Because x=10 and y=2.5 is incorrect. Wait, when we solved the equations, we found that xy=25, but if we take x=10, then y must be 2.5, but that y=2.5 does not satisfy the original equations with x=10. So that suggests that perhaps my error was in assuming that if xy=25, then y=25/x, but substituting into the equations would give inconsistent results. Wait, but this is a system of equations. So if there exist x and y both greater than 1 such that both equations hold, then their product must be 25. But when we take y=25/x and substitute into the equations, we must get an identity. Wait, maybe I need to check whether the system is consistent. Let me take y=25/x and substitute into one of the equations. Let's take the first equation: log_x(y^x)=10. Substituting y=25/x, we get: log_x((25/x)^x)=10. Which simplifies as: log_x(25^x / x^x)=10. Which is: log_x(25^x) - log_x(x^x)=10. Which is x log_x(25) - x =10. Therefore: x (log_x(25) -1 )=10. Let me set log_x(25)=a. Then x (a -1)=10. But since log_x(25)=a, then x^a=25. Therefore, x=25^{1/a}. Substitute into the equation: 25^{1/a} (a -1)=10. So, 25^{1/a} =10/(a -1). Then, raising both sides to the power of a: 25=(10/(a-1))^a. So 25=(10^{a})/(a-1)^a. Multiply both sides by (a-1)^a: 25*(a -1)^a=10^a. Divide both sides by 10^a: 25*( (a -1)^a /10^a )=1. Which simplifies to: 25*( (a -1)/10 )^a=1. Let me define t=(a-1)/10. Then, 25*t^a=1. But since t=(a-1)/10, then a=10t +1. Substitute into the equation: 25*t^{(10t +1)}=1. This seems complicated. Maybe try some values for t. Let me try t=0.5: 25*(0.5)^{6}≈25*(1/64)≈0.390625, which is less than 1. Try t=0.3: 25*(0.3)^{4}≈25*(0.0081)=0.2025, still less than 1. t=0.1: 25*(0.1)^{2}=25*0.01=0.25<1. t=0.2: 25*(0.2)^{3}=25*(0.008)=0.2<1. t=0.4: 25*(0.4)^{5}=25*(0.01024)=0.256<1. Hmm, seems like even at t=1: 25*(1)^{11}=25*1=25>>1. So the function 25*t^{a} where a=10t +1 starts at t=0: 25*0^1=0, and increases to t=1:25*1^11=25. But we need it to equal 1. So somewhere between t=0.5 and t=1, but when t=0.5, it's 0.390625, which is still less than 1. Wait, but when t approaches 1, a=10*1 +1=11, so 25*t^a=25*1^{11}=25. So the function goes from 0 to 25 as t goes from 0 to 1. Therefore, by Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be some t in (0,1) where 25*t^a=1. However, when t increases beyond 1, a=10t +1>11, but t>1, so t^a grows rapidly. Therefore, the equation 25*t^a=1 would not hold for t>1. So the solution must be at some t between 0 and 1. However, solving this equation analytically seems difficult. Therefore, perhaps the problem doesn't require us to find x and y explicitly, just their product, which we've already established as 25. Therefore, even if x and y are some non-integer real numbers, their product is 25. The previous error with x=10 and y=2.5 was because x=10 and y=2.5 do not satisfy the original equations, but that was a mistake in my manual verification, assuming x=10. However, based on the relationship derived from the logarithmic equations, xy must equal 25. Therefore, the answer should be 25. I can check with another approach. Let me let log_x(y)=a. Then, from the first equation: x*a=10, so x=10/a. From the second equation: log_y(x)=10/(4y). But log_y(x)=1/a. So 1/a=10/(4y), therefore y= (10/(4/a))/1= (10a)/4= (5a)/2. Also, since x=10/a, then xy= (10/a)*(5a)/2)= (50a)/(2a)=25. Therefore, regardless of a, xy=25. Therefore, this confirms that even if we introduce a third variable a=log_x(y), then manipulate the equations, we still get xy=25. Therefore, this is consistent. Therefore, the correct answer is 25. Therefore, despite not being able to solve for x and y individually easily, their product is indeed 25. So the final answer is 25. Wait, but another thought: When I considered a=log_x(y), then x=(10)/a and y=(5a)/2. Therefore, xy=25. So even if I wanted to find a, such that x and y are real numbers greater than 1, then a must be positive, since x and y are greater than 1. Let's check. Since x=10/a >1, then 10/a>1 => a<10. Similarly, y=5a/2 >1, so 5a/2>1 => a>4/5. Therefore, a is in (4/5, 10). So a exists. Therefore, there do exist real numbers x and y satisfying the conditions, with product 25. Thus, the answer is correct. Therefore, the answer is 25.

But when we check with x=10, y=25/10=2.5, the first equation holds because log_x(y)=log_10(2.5)=0.3979, which is not 10/x=1. So that's conflicting. Wait, but according to the first equation, log_x(y^x)=10. But if x=10 and y=2.5, then log_10(2.5^10)=log_10(9765.625)= approximately 4, since 10^4=10000, which is close. So 2.5^10≈9765.625, log_10(9765.625)= approximately 3.989, which is not 10. Therefore, the problem is that when we set log_x(y)=10/x, if x=10, then log_x(y)=1, which implies y=10^1=10, but then y=10, so xy=10*10=100, contradicting our previous result. But this is a contradiction. Therefore, there must be a mistake in our reasoning. Wait, no. The problem is in the manual check. Let's go back. When we have log_x(y^x)=10, that's equivalent to x * log_x(y)=10, which implies log_x(y)=10/x. So if x=10, then log_x(y)=1, which implies y=10. So if x=10 and y=10, then xy=100. But according to the second equation, log_y(x^{4y})=10. If x=10 and y=10, then that's log_10(10^{4*10})=log_10(10^{40})=40, which is not 10. Therefore, in that case, the equations are not satisfied. Therefore, x=10 and y=10 is not a solution. Therefore, our initial assumption that xy=25 is wrong? But wait, according to our previous reasoning, we derived that xy=25. But if xy=25, then if x=5, y=5. Then, check the first equation: log_5(5^5)=5, which again is not 10. So clearly, something is wrong here. Wait, so where is the mistake? Wait, the key step was realizing that log_x(y) and log_y(x) are reciprocals. But in our problem, we had log_x(y)=10/x and log_y(x)=5/(2y). Then, since they are reciprocals, (10/x)*(5/(2y))=1 => 50/(2xy)=1 => xy=25. So this derivation seems correct. But when we take x=5, y=5, which gives xy=25, but the equations aren't satisfied. So this suggests that either the problem has no solution, which is not possible because the problem states that such real numbers exist, or there is a mistake in our interpretation. Wait, perhaps we need to check if x and y being greater than 1 affects the solution. Let's go back. We have log_x(y^x)=10, which is equivalent to x * log_x(y)=10 => log_x(y)=10/x. Similarly, log_y(x^{4y})=10 => 4y * log_y(x)=10 => log_y(x)=10/(4y)=5/(2y). Since log_y(x) is the reciprocal of log_x(y), we have log_y(x) = 1 / log_x(y). Therefore, 5/(2y) = 1 / (10/x) => 5/(2y) = x/10. Thus, cross-multiplying: 5*10 = 2y*x => 50=2xy => xy=25. So, regardless of x and y, as long as they satisfy the equations, their product must be 25. Therefore, even if x and y are not integers, their product is 25. The problem says "real numbers x and y, both greater than 1," so they exist. Therefore, even though substituting integers like x=5, y=5 doesn't work, the actual solution would have x and y as real numbers greater than 1, with product 25. For example, let's suppose x= sqrt(25)=5, but that leads to y=5, which we saw doesn't work. So perhaps x and y are other numbers. Let's try to find x and y. Let me take x= sqrt(10), then y=25/sqrt(10)=5*sqrt(10). Let's check the first equation: log_x(y^x)=log_{sqrt(10)}((5*sqrt(10))^{sqrt(10)}). Hmm, this seems complicated and likely not equal to 10. Alternatively, take x= sqrt(25)=5, y=5. As before, doesn't work. Wait, but according to the equations, if xy=25, then y=25/x. Let's express log_x(y)=log_x(25/x)=log_x(25) - log_x(x)=log_x(25)-1. According to the first equation, log_x(y)=10/x. Therefore, log_x(25) -1 =10/x. Thus, log_x(25)=10/x +1. But log_x(25)=ln(25)/ln(x). Therefore, ln(25)/ln(x)=10/x +1. This is an equation in terms of x. Let me write it as: ln(25) = ln(x) * (10/x +1). Let me define f(x)=ln(x)*(10/x +1) - ln(25). We need to solve f(x)=0 for x>1. Let me check if there is a solution. Let me test x=5: f(5)=ln(5)*(2 +1) - ln(25)= ln(5)*3 - ln(25)=3*1.609 - 3.2185≈4.827 -3.2185≈1.6085>0. Test x=10: f(10)=ln(10)*(10/10 +1) - ln(25)= ln(10)*(2) - 3.2185≈4.605*2 -3.2185≈9.21 -3.2185≈5.9915>0. Still positive. Test x=25: f(25)=ln(25)*(10/25 +1) - ln(25)= ln(25)*(1.4) - ln(25)=ln(25)*(1.4 -1)=0.4*ln(25)≈0.4*3.2185≈1.287>0. All positive. Hmm. Test x=50: f(50)=ln(50)*(10/50 +1) - ln(25)= ln(50)*(1.2) - ln(25)≈3.912*1.2 -3.2185≈4.694 -3.2185≈1.475>0. Still positive. Hmm. So f(x) is positive for x from 1 to infinity. Therefore, no solution? But this contradicts the problem statement which says such real numbers exist. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my analysis. Wait, but according to previous reasoning, we derived that xy=25. So even if we can't find x and y through simple substitution, their product must be 25. But maybe the equations have a solution when x and y are specific real numbers, but not integers. Therefore, the key point is that even if we cannot solve for x and y explicitly, we can still find their product, which is 25. Thus, the answer is 25. Alternatively, perhaps there was a miscalculation in the manual check. Let me take x= sqrt(10), then y=25/sqrt(10)=5*sqrt(10). Then, check the first equation: log_x(y^x) = log_{sqrt(10)}((5*sqrt(10))^{sqrt(10)}). Let me compute y^x: (5*sqrt(10))^{sqrt(10}}. Let me express sqrt(10) as 10^{1/2}. Then, y=5*10^{1/2}. Therefore, y^x=(5*10^{1/2})^{10^{1/2}}=5^{10^{1/2}} * (10^{1/2})^{10^{1/2}}=5^{sqrt(10)} *10^{(1/2)*sqrt(10)}}=5^{sqrt(10)}*10^{sqrt(10)/2}. Then, log_{sqrt(10)}(this expression). Let me convert this log to base 10. Let me recall that log_b(a) = ln(a)/ln(b). Therefore: log_{sqrt(10)}(y^x) = ln(y^x)/ln(sqrt(10))= [x ln(y)] / [(1/2) ln(10)] = [sqrt(10) * ln(5*sqrt(10))] / [ (1/2) ln(10) ]. Compute ln(5*sqrt(10))=ln(5) + ln(10^{1/2})=ln(5) + (1/2)ln(10). Therefore, numerator: sqrt(10) [ln(5) + (1/2)ln(10)]. Denominator: (1/2)ln(10). Therefore, overall: [sqrt(10) (ln(5) + (1/2)ln(10))] / [ (1/2)ln(10) ] = [sqrt(10) (ln(5) + (1/2)ln(10)) ] * [2 / ln(10) ] = [2 sqrt(10)/ln(10)]*(ln(5) + (1/2)ln(10)). = [2 sqrt(10)/ln(10)]*ln(5) + [2 sqrt(10)/ln(10)]*(1/2)ln(10) = [2 sqrt(10)/ln(10)]*ln(5) + sqrt(10). But this seems not equal to 10. Therefore, even trying with x=sqrt(10) doesn't work. Therefore, this suggests that solving for x and y explicitly is non-trivial, but the product is still 25. Therefore, the problem must want the answer as 25. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed such that x and y are inverse functions. Wait, but given the time I've spent and different approaches all leading to xy=25, I think that's the correct answer. The key is recognizing that from the reciprocal relations of logarithms, we can get xy=25 without needing to solve for x and y individually. The manual checks with specific numbers were failing because those numbers don't actually satisfy both equations, but the product xy=25 is correct regardless. Therefore, the final answer is 25. **Final Answer** \boxed{25}

Answer: Given the equations \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\) and \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\), we need to find the product \(xy\).

First, simplify the given logarithmic equations using the power rule \(\log_b(a^c) = c \log_b(a)\):

1. \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\) simplifies to \(x \log_x(y) = 10\), which gives \(\log_x(y) = \frac{10}{x}\).
2. \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\) simplifies to \(4y

okay, so i have this problem here: there are real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. i need to find the product xy. hmm, let me try to break this down.
first, let's write down the given equations: 1. \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\) 2. \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\) and we need to find \(xy\). let me recall some logarithmic identities that might help here. remember that \(\log_b(a^c) = c \log_b(a)\). so maybe i can simplify these expressions using that.

1: starting with the first equation: \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\). applying the power rule, this becomes \(x \log_x(y) = 10\). then, dividing both sides by x, we get \(\log_x(y) = \frac{10}{x}\).
</path>
<path>
2: moving on to the second equation: \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\). similarly, using the power rule: \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 4y \log_y(x)\). so, 4y log_y(x) = 10. therefore, log_y(x) = 10 / (4y) = 5 / (2y).
</path>
<conclusion>
the first equation simplifies to log_x(y) = 10/x. the second equation simplifies to log_y(x) = 5/(2y).

but wait, log_y(x) is the reciprocal of log_x(y), right? because if log_x(y) = m, then log_y(x) = 1/m. let me verify that. yeah, because if log_x(y) = m, then x^m = y. therefore, y^{1/m} = x, which means log_y(x) = 1/m. so that relationship holds.
therefore, from the first equation, log_x(y) = 10/x, so log_y(x) should be x/10. but from the second equation, log_y(x) = 5/(2y). therefore, setting them equal: x/10 = 5/(2y). let me write that as an equation: x/10 = 5/(2y). then, solving for x in terms of y, maybe. cross-multiplying gives: 2y * x = 5 * 10. 2xy = 50, so xy = 25. wait, is that possible? so if xy = 25, then that would be the answer. but let me check if that works with both equations. wait, the problem says "find xy," and maybe it's that straightforward? let me check. wait, let's not jump the gun. let's go through the steps methodically. so we have two equations: 1. \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\) which simplifies to \(\log_x(y) = \frac{10}{x}\) 2. \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\) which simplifies to \(\log_y(x) = \frac{5}{2y}\) and we know that \(\log_x(y) = \frac{1}{\log_y(x)}\), so substituting: \(\frac{10}{x} = \frac{1}{\frac{5}{2y}}\) which simplifies to: \(\frac{10}{x} = \frac{2y}{5}\) cross-multiplying: 10 * 5 = 2y * x 50 = 2xy divide both sides by 2: 25 = xy. therefore, xy = 25. hmm, so yes, that's consistent. so then xy = 25. therefore, the answer is 25. but let me verify this. let me suppose that xy = 25. let me check if both original equations hold. let me express y as 25/x, since xy = 25. then, let's substitute into the first equation: \(\log_x(y^x) = \log_x\left(\left(\frac{25}{x}\right)^x\right)\). let's compute that. \(\left(\frac{25}{x}\right)^x = 25^x / x^x\). therefore, \(\log_x(25^x / x^x)\). which is the same as \(\log_x\left((25 / x)^x\right)\). which is x times log_x(25 / x). which is x * (log_x(25) - log_x(x)) = x * (log_x(25) - 1). but log_x(25) is the logarithm of 25 with base x. let's think in parallel.

so if x = 10, then y = 25 / x = 25 / 10 = 2.5. wait, so y = 5/2. but the problem states that both x and y are greater than 1, so that's okay. but let me check the second equation: \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\). substitute x = 10 and y = 5/2. compute \(\log_{5/2}(10^{4*(5/2)})\). 4*(5/2) = 10. so that's \(\log_{2.5}(10^{10})\). let's compute that. let me convert this logarithm to base 10. let's think in parallel.

<path>
1: the change of base formula is applied to log_{2.5}(10^10), yielding (log(10^10) / log(2.5)). this expression simplifies to (10 log(10) / log(2.5)). since log(10) equals 1, the expression further simplifies to 10 / log(2.5). the value of log(2.5) is approximately 0.39794. consequently, 10 / 0.39794 is approximately 25.16. this result contradicts the problem's requirement that the value equals 10.
</path>
<path>
2: the equation (2.5)^m = 10^10 is considered. taking the logarithm of both sides yields m log(2.5) = 10 log(10), which simplifies to m = 10 / log(2.5). since log(2.5) is log(5/2), this can be expressed as m = 10 / (log(5) - log(2)). the problem specifies that log_{2.5}(10^10) should equal 10. this implies that m should be 10, leading to the equation 10 / (log(5) - log(2)) = 10. this equation simplifies to log(5) - log(2) = 1.
</path>
<conclusion>
the change of base calculation for log_{2.5}(10^10) yields approximately 25.16, which does not equal 10. the attempt to verify this value by solving the exponential equation (2.5)^m = 10^10 also implies m should be 10, but this leads to the contradiction log(5) - log(2) = 1, which is false.

wait, that can't be. wait, but according to the problem, substituting x=10 and y=2.5 should satisfy both equations. but when we check, the first equation works because x =10, but the second gives log_{2.5}(10^10) ≈25.16≠10. so something's wrong here. that suggests that our earlier approach might have been flawed. wait, but how? let me retrace. so we had: from the first equation: log_x(y) =10/x. from the second equation: log_y(x)=5/(2y). then we know that log_x(y) and log_y(x) are reciprocals. therefore, (10/x) * (5/(2y)) should be 1, because log_x(y)*log_y(x)=1. wait, but if log_x(y)=10/x and log_y(x)=5/(2y), then their product is (10/x)*(5/(2y))= (50)/(2xy)=25/(xy). but since their product must be 1, then 25/(xy)=1, so xy=25. therefore, regardless of the values of x and y, as long as those logarithmic conditions are met, their product must be 25. therefore, even though substituting x=10 and y=25/10=2.5 seems to not satisfy the second equation, perhaps our manual check is wrong. wait, perhaps my calculation of log_{2.5}(10^10) is incorrect. wait, if x=10 and y=25/10=2.5, then from the first equation, log_x(y) = log_10(2.5) ≈0.3979, and 10/x=10/10=1. but 0.3979≈0.4≠1. so that already doesn't satisfy the first equation. wait, what? this is confusing. wait, maybe my approach is correct but my manual verification is wrong. wait, according to the first equation: log_x(y^x) =10. which is equivalent to x*log_x(y)=10. therefore, log_x(y)=10/x. so if x=10, then log_x(y)=log_{10}(y)=10/10=1. therefore, y=10^1=10. but then y=10, so xy=10*10=100. but earlier we had xy=25. contradiction. wait, this is a problem. so where is the mistake here. wait, perhaps i made a miscalculation. let me go back step by step. original first equation: \(\log_x(y^x) =10\). by the logarithm power rule, this is x * \log_x(y) =10. therefore, \(\log_x(y)=10/x\). original second equation: \(\log_y(x^{4y})=10\). similarly, 4y * \log_y(x)=10. therefore, \(\log_y(x)=10/(4y)=5/(2y)\). now, since \(\log_y(x)\) is the reciprocal of \(\log_x(y)\), so \(\log_y(x)=1/\log_x(y)\). therefore, substituting: 5/(2y) = 1/(10/x) => 5/(2y) = x/10. then, cross-multiplying: 5 * 10 = 2y * x => 50=2xy => xy=25. therefore, regardless of individual values of x and y, their product is 25. therefore, even if x=5, then y=5, but both x and y must be greater than 1. however, in that case, let's check if x=5, y=5. then xy=25. check the first equation: \(\log_5(5^5)\). log_5(5^5)=5, but the equation says it should be 10. so that's not correct. so x and y cannot be 5. hmm. so then, what's going on here? if xy=25, then x and y must satisfy that. let me express y as 25/x and substitute back into the expressions. from the first equation: \(\log_x(y^x)=\log_x\left(\left(\frac{25}{x}\right)^x\right) = \log_x\left(\frac{25^x}{x^x}\right) = \log_x(25^x) - \log_x(x^x) = x \log_x(25) - x = x(\log_x(25) - 1)\). but this is supposed to equal 10. so: x(\log_x(25) - 1) =10. let me let log_x(25) = m. then, x(m - 1) =10. but since log_x(25)=m, then x^m =25. so x=25^{1/m}. substitute x into the equation: 25^{1/m}(m - 1) =10. this seems a bit complicated. let me see if i can solve for m. let me write it as: 25^{1/m} =10/(m -1). then, take both sides to the power of m: 25 = \left(\frac{10}{m-1}\right)^m. this equation in terms of m might be difficult to solve algebraically. maybe we can find m numerically? but the problem asks only for the product xy, which we've found is 25. the individual values of x and y might not be integers, but their product is 25. therefore, even though x and y are some real numbers (not specified to be integers), their product is 25. so the answer is 25. then why did our earlier check with x=10, y=2.5 not work? because x=10 and y=2.5 is incorrect. wait, when we solved the equations, we found that xy=25, but if we take x=10, then y must be 2.5, but that y=2.5 does not satisfy the original equations with x=10. so that suggests that perhaps my error was in assuming that if xy=25, then y=25/x, but substituting into the equations would give inconsistent results. wait, but this is a system of equations. so if there exist x and y both greater than 1 such that both equations hold, then their product must be 25. but when we take y=25/x and substitute into the equations, we must get an identity. wait, maybe i need to check whether the system is consistent. let me take y=25/x and substitute into one of the equations. let's take the first equation: log_x(y^x)=10. substituting y=25/x, we get: log_x((25/x)^x)=10. which simplifies as: log_x(25^x / x^x)=10. which is: log_x(25^x) - log_x(x^x)=10. which is x log_x(25) - x =10. therefore: x (log_x(25) -1 )=10. let me set log_x(25)=a. then x (a -1)=10. but since log_x(25)=a, then x^a=25. therefore, x=25^{1/a}. substitute into the equation: 25^{1/a} (a -1)=10. so, 25^{1/a} =10/(a -1). then, raising both sides to the power of a: 25=(10/(a-1))^a. so 25=(10^{a})/(a-1)^a. multiply both sides by (a-1)^a: 25*(a -1)^a=10^a. divide both sides by 10^a: 25*( (a -1)^a /10^a )=1. which simplifies to: 25*( (a -1)/10 )^a=1. let me define t=(a-1)/10. then, 25*t^a=1. but since t=(a-1)/10, then a=10t +1. substitute into the equation: 25*t^{(10t +1)}=1. this seems complicated. maybe try some values for t. let me try t=0.5: 25*(0.5)^{6}≈25*(1/64)≈0.390625, which is less than 1. try t=0.3: 25*(0.3)^{4}≈25*(0.0081)=0.2025, still less than 1. t=0.1: 25*(0.1)^{2}=25*0.01=0.25<1. t=0.2: 25*(0.2)^{3}=25*(0.008)=0.2<1. t=0.4: 25*(0.4)^{5}=25*(0.01024)=0.256<1. hmm, seems like even at t=1: 25*(1)^{11}=25*1=25>>1. so the function 25*t^{a} where a=10t +1 starts at t=0: 25*0^1=0, and increases to t=1:25*1^11=25. but we need it to equal 1. so somewhere between t=0.5 and t=1, but when t=0.5, it's 0.390625, which is still less than 1. wait, but when t approaches 1, a=10*1 +1=11, so 25*t^a=25*1^{11}=25. so the function goes from 0 to 25 as t goes from 0 to 1. therefore, by intermediate value theorem, there must be some t in (0,1) where 25*t^a=1. however, when t increases beyond 1, a=10t +1>11, but t>1, so t^a grows rapidly. therefore, the equation 25*t^a=1 would not hold for t>1. so the solution must be at some t between 0 and 1. however, solving this equation analytically seems difficult. therefore, perhaps the problem doesn't require us to find x and y explicitly, just their product, which we've already established as 25. therefore, even if x and y are some non-integer real numbers, their product is 25. the previous error with x=10 and y=2.5 was because x=10 and y=2.5 do not satisfy the original equations, but that was a mistake in my manual verification, assuming x=10. however, based on the relationship derived from the logarithmic equations, xy must equal 25. therefore, the answer should be 25. i can check with another approach. let me let log_x(y)=a. then, from the first equation: x*a=10, so x=10/a. from the second equation: log_y(x)=10/(4y). but log_y(x)=1/a. so 1/a=10/(4y), therefore y= (10/(4/a))/1= (10a)/4= (5a)/2. also, since x=10/a, then xy= (10/a)*(5a)/2)= (50a)/(2a)=25. therefore, regardless of a, xy=25. therefore, this confirms that even if we introduce a third variable a=log_x(y), then manipulate the equations, we still get xy=25. therefore, this is consistent. therefore, the correct answer is 25. therefore, despite not being able to solve for x and y individually easily, their product is indeed 25. so the final answer is 25. wait, but another thought: when i considered a=log_x(y), then x=(10)/a and y=(5a)/2. therefore, xy=25. so even if i wanted to find a, such that x and y are real numbers greater than 1, then a must be positive, since x and y are greater than 1. let's check. since x=10/a >1, then 10/a>1 => a<10. similarly, y=5a/2 >1, so 5a/2>1 => a>4/5. therefore, a is in (4/5, 10). so a exists. therefore, there do exist real numbers x and y satisfying the conditions, with product 25. thus, the answer is correct. therefore, the answer is 25.

but when we check with x=10, y=25/10=2.5, the first equation holds because log_x(y)=log_10(2.5)=0.3979, which is not 10/x=1. so that's conflicting. wait, but according to the first equation, log_x(y^x)=10. but if x=10 and y=2.5, then log_10(2.5^10)=log_10(9765.625)= approximately 4, since 10^4=10000, which is close. so 2.5^10≈9765.625, log_10(9765.625)= approximately 3.989, which is not 10. therefore, the problem is that when we set log_x(y)=10/x, if x=10, then log_x(y)=1, which implies y=10^1=10, but then y=10, so xy=10*10=100, contradicting our previous result. but this is a contradiction. therefore, there must be a mistake in our reasoning. wait, no. the problem is in the manual check. let's go back. when we have log_x(y^x)=10, that's equivalent to x * log_x(y)=10, which implies log_x(y)=10/x. so if x=10, then log_x(y)=1, which implies y=10. so if x=10 and y=10, then xy=100. but according to the second equation, log_y(x^{4y})=10. if x=10 and y=10, then that's log_10(10^{4*10})=log_10(10^{40})=40, which is not 10. therefore, in that case, the equations are not satisfied. therefore, x=10 and y=10 is not a solution. therefore, our initial assumption that xy=25 is wrong? but wait, according to our previous reasoning, we derived that xy=25. but if xy=25, then if x=5, y=5. then, check the first equation: log_5(5^5)=5, which again is not 10. so clearly, something is wrong here. wait, so where is the mistake? wait, the key step was realizing that log_x(y) and log_y(x) are reciprocals. but in our problem, we had log_x(y)=10/x and log_y(x)=5/(2y). then, since they are reciprocals, (10/x)*(5/(2y))=1 => 50/(2xy)=1 => xy=25. so this derivation seems correct. but when we take x=5, y=5, which gives xy=25, but the equations aren't satisfied. so this suggests that either the problem has no solution, which is not possible because the problem states that such real numbers exist, or there is a mistake in our interpretation. wait, perhaps we need to check if x and y being greater than 1 affects the solution. let's go back. we have log_x(y^x)=10, which is equivalent to x * log_x(y)=10 => log_x(y)=10/x. similarly, log_y(x^{4y})=10 => 4y * log_y(x)=10 => log_y(x)=10/(4y)=5/(2y). since log_y(x) is the reciprocal of log_x(y), we have log_y(x) = 1 / log_x(y). therefore, 5/(2y) = 1 / (10/x) => 5/(2y) = x/10. thus, cross-multiplying: 5*10 = 2y*x => 50=2xy => xy=25. so, regardless of x and y, as long as they satisfy the equations, their product must be 25. therefore, even if x and y are not integers, their product is 25. the problem says "real numbers x and y, both greater than 1," so they exist. therefore, even though substituting integers like x=5, y=5 doesn't work, the actual solution would have x and y as real numbers greater than 1, with product 25. for example, let's suppose x= sqrt(25)=5, but that leads to y=5, which we saw doesn't work. so perhaps x and y are other numbers. let's try to find x and y. let me take x= sqrt(10), then y=25/sqrt(10)=5*sqrt(10). let's check the first equation: log_x(y^x)=log_{sqrt(10)}((5*sqrt(10))^{sqrt(10)}). hmm, this seems complicated and likely not equal to 10. alternatively, take x= sqrt(25)=5, y=5. as before, doesn't work. wait, but according to the equations, if xy=25, then y=25/x. let's express log_x(y)=log_x(25/x)=log_x(25) - log_x(x)=log_x(25)-1. according to the first equation, log_x(y)=10/x. therefore, log_x(25) -1 =10/x. thus, log_x(25)=10/x +1. but log_x(25)=ln(25)/ln(x). therefore, ln(25)/ln(x)=10/x +1. this is an equation in terms of x. let me write it as: ln(25) = ln(x) * (10/x +1). let me define f(x)=ln(x)*(10/x +1) - ln(25). we need to solve f(x)=0 for x>1. let me check if there is a solution. let me test x=5: f(5)=ln(5)*(2 +1) - ln(25)= ln(5)*3 - ln(25)=3*1.609 - 3.2185≈4.827 -3.2185≈1.6085>0. test x=10: f(10)=ln(10)*(10/10 +1) - ln(25)= ln(10)*(2) - 3.2185≈4.605*2 -3.2185≈9.21 -3.2185≈5.9915>0. still positive. test x=25: f(25)=ln(25)*(10/25 +1) - ln(25)= ln(25)*(1.4) - ln(25)=ln(25)*(1.4 -1)=0.4*ln(25)≈0.4*3.2185≈1.287>0. all positive. hmm. test x=50: f(50)=ln(50)*(10/50 +1) - ln(25)= ln(50)*(1.2) - ln(25)≈3.912*1.2 -3.2185≈4.694 -3.2185≈1.475>0. still positive. hmm. so f(x) is positive for x from 1 to infinity. therefore, no solution? but this contradicts the problem statement which says such real numbers exist. therefore, there must be a mistake in my analysis. wait, but according to previous reasoning, we derived that xy=25. so even if we can't find x and y through simple substitution, their product must be 25. but maybe the equations have a solution when x and y are specific real numbers, but not integers. therefore, the key point is that even if we cannot solve for x and y explicitly, we can still find their product, which is 25. thus, the answer is 25. alternatively, perhaps there was a miscalculation in the manual check. let me take x= sqrt(10), then y=25/sqrt(10)=5*sqrt(10). then, check the first equation: log_x(y^x) = log_{sqrt(10)}((5*sqrt(10))^{sqrt(10)}). let me compute y^x: (5*sqrt(10))^{sqrt(10}}. let me express sqrt(10) as 10^{1/2}. then, y=5*10^{1/2}. therefore, y^x=(5*10^{1/2})^{10^{1/2}}=5^{10^{1/2}} * (10^{1/2})^{10^{1/2}}=5^{sqrt(10)} *10^{(1/2)*sqrt(10)}}=5^{sqrt(10)}*10^{sqrt(10)/2}. then, log_{sqrt(10)}(this expression). let me convert this log to base 10. let me recall that log_b(a) = ln(a)/ln(b). therefore: log_{sqrt(10)}(y^x) = ln(y^x)/ln(sqrt(10))= [x ln(y)] / [(1/2) ln(10)] = [sqrt(10) * ln(5*sqrt(10))] / [ (1/2) ln(10) ]. compute ln(5*sqrt(10))=ln(5) + ln(10^{1/2})=ln(5) + (1/2)ln(10). therefore, numerator: sqrt(10) [ln(5) + (1/2)ln(10)]. denominator: (1/2)ln(10). therefore, overall: [sqrt(10) (ln(5) + (1/2)ln(10))] / [ (1/2)ln(10) ] = [sqrt(10) (ln(5) + (1/2)ln(10)) ] * [2 / ln(10) ] = [2 sqrt(10)/ln(10)]*(ln(5) + (1/2)ln(10)). = [2 sqrt(10)/ln(10)]*ln(5) + [2 sqrt(10)/ln(10)]*(1/2)ln(10) = [2 sqrt(10)/ln(10)]*ln(5) + sqrt(10). but this seems not equal to 10. therefore, even trying with x=sqrt(10) doesn't work. therefore, this suggests that solving for x and y explicitly is non-trivial, but the product is still 25. therefore, the problem must want the answer as 25. alternatively, maybe the problem is designed such that x and y are inverse functions. wait, but given the time i've spent and different approaches all leading to xy=25, i think that's the correct answer. the key is recognizing that from the reciprocal relations of logarithms, we can get xy=25 without needing to solve for x and y individually. the manual checks with specific numbers were failing because those numbers don't actually satisfy both equations, but the product xy=25 is correct regardless. therefore, the final answer is 25. **final answer** \boxed{25}

answer: given the equations \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\) and \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\), we need to find the product \(xy\).

first, simplify the given logarithmic equations using the power rule \(\log_b(a^c) = c \log_b(a)\):

1. \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\) simplifies to \(x \log_x(y) = 10\), which gives \(\log_x(y) = \frac{10}{x}\).
2. \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\) simplifies to \(4y
