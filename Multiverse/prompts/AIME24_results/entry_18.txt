Okay, so I need to solve this problem where I have to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300, and the equation a2b + a2c + b2a + b2c + c2a + c2b = 6,000,000.
Hmm, that's a pretty big number.
Let me see.
First, the problem gives me two equations: 1. a + b + c = 300 2. a2b + a2c + b2a + b2c + c2a + c2b = 6,000,000
I need to find all triples (a, b, c) that satisfy both.
Let me start by understanding what those equations mean and how they relate.
Let's think in parallel.

</Path>
<Conclusion>
The problem features symmetric equations and nonnegative integer variables.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So, permutations of a triple will also be solutions if the original is.
That might help in reducing the cases I need to check.
Let me look at the first equation: a + b + c = 300.
That's a standard equation for three variables summing to a constant.
The number of nonnegative integer solutions would be C(300 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(302, 2).
But that's if there were no other conditions.
However, the second equation restricts the possible triples significantly.
So, we have to find the ones that satisfy both.
Looking at the second equation: a2b + a2c + b2a + b2c + c2a + c2b = 6,000,000.
That seems complicated, but maybe there's a way to factor or rewrite it.
Let me note that the expression can be written as: ab(a + b) + ac(a + c) + bc(b + c)
Wait, let's check that: For example, ab(a + b) = a2b + ab2, right?
Similarly, ac(a + c) = a2c + ac2, and bc(b + c) = b2c + bc2.
So adding those together: ab(a + b) + ac(a + c) + bc(b + c) = a2b + ab2 + a2c + ac2 + b2c + bc2
Which is exactly the left-hand side of the given equation.
So yes, the expression can be written as ab(a + b) + ac(a + c) + bc(b + c) = 6,000,000.
But how does that help?
Let me also note that since a + b + c = 300, then we can express (a + b) as (300 - c), (a + c) as (300 - b), and (b + c) as (300 - a).
So substituting that into the equation: ab(300 - c) + ac(300 - b) + bc(300 - a) = 6,000,000.
Let me compute that: ab(300 - c) + ac(300 - b) + bc(300 - a) = 300(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc
Wait, let's check that expansion: First term: ab*300 - ab*c Second term: ac*300 - ac*b Third term: bc*300 - bc*a
So adding all three: 300(ab + ac + bc) - abc(a + b + c)/?
Wait, wait: Wait, when we add the second terms from each: -ab*c - ac*b - bc*a = -3abc
Because ab*c is the same as abc, right?
So, each of those terms is -abc, and there are three of them: -ab*c - ac*b - bc*a = -abc - abc - abc = -3abc.
Wait, but in the previous calculation: ab(300 - c) + ac(300 - b) + bc(300 - a) = 300(ab + ac + bc) - (ab*c + ac*b + bc*a)
Which is equal to 300(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc.
Because ab*c, ac*b, and bc*a are all the same as abc, so each term is -abc, and there are three => -3abc.
Therefore, the equation becomes: 300(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc = 6,000,000
Let me verify that again.
Let's think in parallel.

<Conclusion>
The sum of the terms ab(300 - c) is 300(ab + ac + bc) - abc(a + b + c), and the sum of the terms -ab*c is -3abc.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
But in our case, a + b + c = 300, so abc(a + b + c) = 300 abc.
Therefore, the expansion would be: 300(ab + ac + bc) - 300 abc = 6,000,000.
Wait, but earlier, I thought it was 300(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc = 6,000,000.
Wait, which is it?
Hold on: Original expression: ab(300 - c) + ac(300 - b) + bc(300 - a) = 300(ab + ac + bc) - (ab*c + ac*b + bc*a) As above.
Then, ab*c + ac*b + bc*a = 3abc, since each term is equivalent to abc.
So the expression is: 300(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc = 6,000,000.
But wait, abc*(a + b + c) would be 300 abc, but that's not what we have here.
We have minus 3abc.
So in this case, the equation is: 300(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc = 6,000,000.
Therefore, we can divide both sides by 3: 100(ab + ac + bc) - abc = 2,000,000.
So, 100(ab + ac + bc) - abc = 2,000,000.
Hmm, that seems more manageable.
So now, our two equations are: 1. a + b + c = 300 2. 100(ab + ac + bc) - abc = 2,000,000
So, perhaps we can express abc in terms of ab + ac + bc, or look for some relation.
Alternatively, perhaps think of the polynomial with roots a, b, c.
Wait, but since a + b + c = 300, but if we consider variables x, y, z such that x = a, y = b, z = c, then we can think in terms of symmetric polynomials.
However, note that in equation 2, we have 100(ab + ac + bc) - abc = 2,000,000.
Let me denote S = ab + ac + bc and P = abc.
Then, the equations are: a + b + c = 300 S = ab + ac + bc P = abc
And the second equation is 100*S - P = 2,000,000.
So, P = 100*S - 2,000,000.
Hmm.
So if we can relate S and P, perhaps using inequalities or other identities.
For nonnegative integers a, b, c, we know that (a + b + c)^2 = a2 + b2 + c2 + 2(ab + ac + bc).
So, 3002 = (a2 + b2 + c2) + 2S.
Thus, 90,000 = a2 + b2 + c2 + 2S, so a2 + b2 + c2 = 90,000 - 2S.
But I don't know if that helps.
Alternatively, maybe we can use the identity: (a + b + c)^3 = a3 + b3 + c3 + 6abc + 3(a2b + a2c + b2a + b2c + c2a + c2b)
Wait, let me check that.
Yes, if we expand (a + b + c)^3, the total terms are: a3 + b3 + c3 + 3(a2b + a2c + b2a + b2c + c2a + c2b) + 6abc.
So, (a + b + c)^3 = a3 + b3 + c3 + 3(a2b + a2c + b2a + b2c + c2a + c2b) + 6abc
But we know a + b + c = 300, so 300^3 = 27,000,000.
Let's think in parallel.

The sum of the cubes of the variables is denoted by C, and the sum of the terms a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b is 6,000,000.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So, 27,000,000 = C + 3*6,000,000 + 6abc
Calculate that: 27,000,000 = C + 18,000,000 + 6abc
Therefore, C + 6abc = 9,000,000
But we also know from equation 2 that 100 S - abc = 2,000,000, so maybe we can express abc in terms of S: abc = 100 S - 2,000,000
So, substituting into C + 6abc = 9,000,000: C + 6*(100 S - 2,000,000) = 9,000,000
So, C + 600 S - 12,000,000 = 9,000,000
Therefore, C + 600 S = 21,000,000
But C is a3 + b3 + c3.
Hmm.
Alternatively, another identity: a3 + b3 + c3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a2 + b2 + c2 - ab - ac - bc)
So, a3 + b3 + c3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)((a2 + b2 + c2 - ab - ac - bc))
But we can write a2 + b2 + c2 in terms of S: From (a + b + c)^2 = a2 + b2 + c2 + 2S, so a2 + b2 + c2 = 90,000 - 2S.
Therefore, a2 + b2 + c2 - ab - ac - bc = (90,000 - 2S) - S = 90,000 - 3S.
Therefore, a3 + b3 + c3 - 3abc = 300*(90,000 - 3S)
So, a3 + b3 + c3 = 300*(90,000 - 3S) + 3abc
But we already have a3 + b3 + c3 = C, which from earlier equation is C = 9,000,000 - 6abc
Wait, from C + 6abc = 9,000,000, so C = 9,000,000 - 6abc
Therefore, equate the two expressions for a3 + b3 + c3: 300*(90,000 - 3S) + 3abc = 9,000,000 - 6abc
Let's compute left-hand side: 300*90,000 - 300*3S + 3abc = 27,000,000 - 900S + 3abc
Set equal to right-hand side: 27,000,000 - 900S + 3abc = 9,000,000 - 6abc
Bring all terms to left-hand side: 27,000,000 - 900S + 3abc - 9,000,000 + 6abc = 0
Simplify: (27,000,000 - 9,000,000) + (-900S) + (3abc + 6abc) = 18,000,000 - 900S + 9abc = 0
Divide both sides by 9: 2,000,000 - 100S + abc = 0
Therefore, abc = 100S - 2,000,000
Which matches our earlier result from the second equation.
So that's consistent.
So, perhaps all these identities lead us back to the same equation.
So maybe this approach isn't the best.
Let me think of another way.
Given that a + b + c = 300 and 100S - abc = 2,000,000, where S = ab + ac + bc.
Let me try to find possible values of a, b, c.
Let's consider possible scenarios where the equations hold.
First, suppose that two of the variables are equal, and the third is different.
For example, let a = b, and c be different.
Maybe symmetry would lead us to some solutions.
Let's assume a = b, and see if we can find c.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>

2: The number of solutions where all three variables are equal.

Let's think in parallel.

</Goal>
<Path>
1.1: Let me set a = b.
Then, since a + b + c = 300, that becomes 2a + c = 300, so c = 300 - 2a.
</Path>
<Path>
1.2: The product abc becomes a^2c.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
Under the condition a=b, S simplifies to a^2 + 2ac, and abc simplifies to a^2c.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Then, S = ab + ac + bc.
Since a = b, S = a2 + a(300 - 2a) + a(300 - 2a) = a2 + a(300 - 2a) * 2
Wait, ab = a2, ac = a(300 - 2a), bc = a(300 - 2a).
So S = a2 + 2a(300 - 2a) = a2 + 600a - 4a2 = -3a2 + 600a
Therefore, S = -3a2 + 600a.
Then, abc = a2(300 - 2a) = 300a2 - 2a3.
So, substituting into the second equation: 100S - abc = 2,000,000
So 100*(-3a2 + 600a) - (300a2 - 2a3) = 2,000,000
Compute left-hand side: -300a2 + 60,000a - 300a2 + 2a3 = 2a3 - 600a2 + 60,000a
Set equal to 2,000,000: 2a3 - 600a2 + 60,000a - 2,000,000 = 0
Divide both sides by 2: a3 - 300a2 + 30,000a - 1,000,000 = 0
Hmm, maybe factor this polynomial.
Let me see if there's an integer root.
Possible rational roots would be divisors of 1,000,000.
Given that a has to be an integer between 0 and 150 (since 2a ≤ 300).
So a is from 0 to 150.
Let me try a = 100.
Compute 1003 - 300*1002 + 30,000*100 - 1,000,000
= 1,000,000 - 300*10,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000
= 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 0.
So a = 100 is a root.
Therefore, (a - 100) is a factor.
Let me perform polynomial division to factor it.
Divide a3 - 300a2 + 30,000a - 1,000,000 by (a - 100).
Using synthetic division: 100 | 1 -300 30,000 -1,000,000 | 100 -200 10,000 1 -200 29,800 0
Wait, that gives: 1*a2 + (-300 + 100)*a + (30,000 - 200*100) ? Wait, maybe let me set up synthetic division properly.
Since we're dividing by (a - 100), the root is 100.
Coefficients: 1 (a3), -300 (a2), 30,000 (a), -1,000,000 (constant).
Bring down the 1.
Multiply by 100: 100.
Add to -300: -200.
Multiply by 100: -20,000.
Add to 30,000: 10,000.
Multiply by 100: 1,000,000.
Add to -1,000,000: 0.
So the quotient is a2 - 200a + 10,000.
Therefore, factoring: (a - 100)(a2 - 200a + 10,000) = 0
The quadratic factors further: a2 - 200a + 10,000 = (a - 100)^2
Because discriminant is 40,000 - 40,000 = 0.
So, it's a perfect square.
Thus, the equation factors as (a - 100)^3 = 0.
Therefore, a = 100 is the only real root, with multiplicity 3.
Therefore, the only solution in this case is a = 100.
Then, since a = b, and c = 300 - 2a = 300 - 200 = 100.
So the triple is (100, 100, 100).
Let's think in parallel.

The triple (100, 100, 100) satisfies both the sum equation a+b+c=300 and the second equation a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So that works.
Therefore, when a = b = c, the triple (100, 100, 100) is a solution.
But since the problem asks for all triples, including permutations, but in this case all three are equal, so the only triple is (100,100,100).
But maybe there are other solutions where two variables are equal and the third different.
Wait, but in our assumption that a = b, the only solution was all equal.
So perhaps there are no other solutions with two variables equal.
Alternatively, maybe other triples where all three variables are different.
Alternatively, let's think about the equations again.
We have a + b + c = 300 and 100S - abc = 2,000,000.
Since S = ab + ac + bc, and abc = P.
Perhaps we can relate S and P in some other way.
Alternatively, maybe assume that two variables are equal and the third is different, leading to symmetric equations.
Wait, but when we assumed a = b, we only got the solution where a = b = c.
So maybe all solutions must have a = b = c?
Let's see.
Suppose a, b, c are not all equal.
Let me check if there can be solutions.
Suppose two variables are equal, say a = b, and c different.
As before, 2a + c = 300, and 100(a2 + 2ac) - a2c = 2,000,000.
Which simplified to the cubic equation we had earlier.
But in that case, the only solution was a = 100, c = 100.
So if a = b, then c must also equal 100.
Thus, no solutions with two variables equal and the third different.
Therefore, perhaps the only solution is the triple (100,100,100).
But wait, the problem says "nonnegative integers (a,b,c)", so permutations are included, but in this case, all are the same.
So the triple is the same under permutation.
But maybe there are solutions where all three variables are distinct.
Hmm.
How can we check that?
Alternatively, perhaps express abc in terms of S: From equation 2: abc = 100S - 2,000,000.
We also have the identity: (ab + bc + ca)^2 >= 3abc, which is AM-GM.
But let me check.
Wait, AM-GM gives (ab + bc + ca)/3 >= (ab * bc * ca)^{1/3} = (a^2 b^2 c^2)^{1/3} = (abc)^{2/3}
So, (ab + bc + ca)^3 >= 3^3 (abc)^2
So S^3 >= 27 (abc)^2
But from equation 2, abc = 100S - 2,000,000.
Substitute: S^3 >= 27(100S - 2,000,000)^2
But this might not be solvable, but maybe gives a bound on S.
Alternatively, let's see.
If abc = 100S - 2,000,000, then substituting into the inequality: S^3 >= 27(100S - 2,000,000)^2
Let me see if S = ab + bc + ca, and we have a + b + c = 300.
Maybe another approach is to use Cauchy-Schwarz.
For example, (ab + ac + bc)^2 <= (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)(b^2 + c^2 + a^2) but not sure.
Alternatively, use the fact that for nonnegative reals, (a + b + c)^2 >= 3(ab + ac + bc).
Wait, actually: (a + b + c)^2 = a2 + b2 + c2 + 2(ab + ac + bc) >= 3(ab + ac + bc)
Because since a2 + b2 + c2 >= ab + ac + bc, so: 2(ab + ac + bc) + (ab + ac + bc) <= (a2 + b2 + c2) + 2(ab + ac + bc) = (a + b + c)^2 = 90,000
Therefore, 3S <= 90,000 => S <= 30,000
Equality when a = b = c, so S = 3*a*b, but when a = b = c, ab + ac + bc = 3a2, where a = 100, so S = 3*1002 = 30,000.
So maximum S is 30,000 when a = b = c = 100.
Similarly, the minimum S?
The minimum S occurs when two variables are as unequal as possible.
For example, when one variable is 300 and others are 0.
Then S = 0.
But let's check.
If a = 300, b = 0, c = 0, then S = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0.
So S can be between 0 and 30,000.
But given our equation 100S - abc = 2,000,000, we can note that abc = 100S - 2,000,000.
Since abc must be a nonnegative integer (as a, b, c are nonnegative integers), so 100S - 2,000,000 must be nonnegative.
Thus, 100S >= 2,000,000 => S >= 20,000.
Therefore, ab + bc + ca >= 20,000.
So S >= 20,000.
Thus, combined with the earlier inequality that S <= 30,000, so S is between 20,000 and 30,000.
Hmm.
So S is between 20,000 and 30,000.
So abc = 100S - 2,000,000.
So abc is 100*20,000 - 2,000,000 = 0 up to 100*30,000 - 2,000,000 = 10,000,000 - 2,000,000 = 8,000,000.
Wait, but when S is maximum (30,000), abc = 1,000,000.
Wait, wait: abc = 100*30,000 - 2,000,000 = 3,000,000 - 2,000,000 = 1,000,000.
Wait, maybe miscalculation.
Wait, 100*S - 2,000,000.
So if S = 30,000, then abc = 100*30,000 - 2,000,000 = 3,000,000 - 2,000,000 = 1,000,000.
So when a = b = c = 100, abc = 100*100*100 = 1,000,000, which matches.
So in that case, abc = 1,000,000.
But when S is minimal (S=20,000), abc = 100*20,000 - 2,000,000 = 2,000,000 - 2,000,000 = 0.
So abc = 0.
So when S=20,000, abc=0.
So possible?
For example, if two variables are zero, say a = 300, b = 0, c = 0, then S = 0, but that gives abc = 0 = 100*0 - 2,000,000, which would require abc = -2,000,000.
Which is impossible since abc is nonnegative.
So S must be at least 20,000.
So how can abc = 0?
If any of a, b, c is zero.
Let me check.
Suppose abc = 0.
Then, 100S - 0 = 2,000,000 => S = 20,000.
So if abc = 0, then S = 20,000.
So is there a solution with one variable zero and S = 20,000?
Let's suppose c = 0.
Then, a + b = 300, and S = ab + a*0 + b*0 = ab.
So ab = 20,000.
So, we need a and b nonnegative integers such that a + b = 300 and ab = 20,000.

1.1: For two nonnegative integers a and b satisfying a + b = 300, their product ab can be maximized when a and b are equal, specifically a = b = 150, resulting in a maximum product of 22,500. This maximum product value of 22,500 is greater than the required product of 20,000. The product ab = 20,000 is therefore achievable. The quadratic equation x^2 - 300x + 20,000 = 0 is formed, with roots x = [300 ± sqrt(300^2 - 4*1*20,000)] / 2. The discriminant is calculated as 90,000 - 80,000 = 10,000. The roots are x = [300 ± 100] / 2, which are x = 200 or x = 100. This yields the integer solutions (a, b) = (200, 100) or (100, 200).

<think>
okay, so i need to solve this problem where i have to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300, and the equation a2b + a2c + b2a + b2c + c2a + c2b = 6,000,000.
hmm, that's a pretty big number.
let me see.
first, the problem gives me two equations: 1. a + b + c = 300 2. a2b + a2c + b2a + b2c + c2a + c2b = 6,000,000
i need to find all triples (a, b, c) that satisfy both.
let me start by understanding what those equations mean and how they relate.
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>
<goal>
<outline>
1: the symmetry of the equations and the implications for the variables.
</outline>
<outline>
2: the nature of the variables as nonnegative integers.
</outline>

1: both equations exhibit symmetry with respect to the variables a, b, and c.
</path>
<path>
2: the variables a, b, and c are constrained to be nonnegative integers, which defines the domain of the solution set.
</path>
<conclusion>
the problem features symmetric equations and nonnegative integer variables.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
so, permutations of a triple will also be solutions if the original is.
that might help in reducing the cases i need to check.
let me look at the first equation: a + b + c = 300.
that's a standard equation for three variables summing to a constant.
the number of nonnegative integer solutions would be c(300 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = c(302, 2).
but that's if there were no other conditions.
however, the second equation restricts the possible triples significantly.
so, we have to find the ones that satisfy both.
looking at the second equation: a2b + a2c + b2a + b2c + c2a + c2b = 6,000,000.
that seems complicated, but maybe there's a way to factor or rewrite it.
let me note that the expression can be written as: ab(a + b) + ac(a + c) + bc(b + c)
wait, let's check that: for example, ab(a + b) = a2b + ab2, right?
similarly, ac(a + c) = a2c + ac2, and bc(b + c) = b2c + bc2.
so adding those together: ab(a + b) + ac(a + c) + bc(b + c) = a2b + ab2 + a2c + ac2 + b2c + bc2
which is exactly the left-hand side of the given equation.
so yes, the expression can be written as ab(a + b) + ac(a + c) + bc(b + c) = 6,000,000.
but how does that help?
let me also note that since a + b + c = 300, then we can express (a + b) as (300 - c), (a + c) as (300 - b), and (b + c) as (300 - a).
so substituting that into the equation: ab(300 - c) + ac(300 - b) + bc(300 - a) = 6,000,000.
let me compute that: ab(300 - c) + ac(300 - b) + bc(300 - a) = 300(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc
wait, let's check that expansion: first term: ab*300 - ab*c second term: ac*300 - ac*b third term: bc*300 - bc*a
so adding all three: 300(ab + ac + bc) - abc(a + b + c)/?
wait, wait: wait, when we add the second terms from each: -ab*c - ac*b - bc*a = -3abc
because ab*c is the same as abc, right?
so, each of those terms is -abc, and there are three of them: -ab*c - ac*b - bc*a = -abc - abc - abc = -3abc.
wait, but in the previous calculation: ab(300 - c) + ac(300 - b) + bc(300 - a) = 300(ab + ac + bc) - (ab*c + ac*b + bc*a)
which is equal to 300(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc.
because ab*c, ac*b, and bc*a are all the same as abc, so each term is -abc, and there are three => -3abc.
therefore, the equation becomes: 300(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc = 6,000,000
let me verify that again.
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>

<path>
1: the expression ab(300 - c) + ac(300 - b) + bc(300 - a) expands to 300(ab + ac + bc) - abc(a + b + c).
</path>
<path>
2: the sum of the terms -ab*c, -ac*b, and -bc*a is -3abc.
</path>
<conclusion>
the sum of the terms ab(300 - c) is 300(ab + ac + bc) - abc(a + b + c), and the sum of the terms -ab*c is -3abc.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
but in our case, a + b + c = 300, so abc(a + b + c) = 300 abc.
therefore, the expansion would be: 300(ab + ac + bc) - 300 abc = 6,000,000.
wait, but earlier, i thought it was 300(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc = 6,000,000.
wait, which is it?
hold on: original expression: ab(300 - c) + ac(300 - b) + bc(300 - a) = 300(ab + ac + bc) - (ab*c + ac*b + bc*a) as above.
then, ab*c + ac*b + bc*a = 3abc, since each term is equivalent to abc.
so the expression is: 300(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc = 6,000,000.
but wait, abc*(a + b + c) would be 300 abc, but that's not what we have here.
we have minus 3abc.
so in this case, the equation is: 300(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc = 6,000,000.
therefore, we can divide both sides by 3: 100(ab + ac + bc) - abc = 2,000,000.
so, 100(ab + ac + bc) - abc = 2,000,000.
hmm, that seems more manageable.
so now, our two equations are: 1. a + b + c = 300 2. 100(ab + ac + bc) - abc = 2,000,000
so, perhaps we can express abc in terms of ab + ac + bc, or look for some relation.
alternatively, perhaps think of the polynomial with roots a, b, c.
wait, but since a + b + c = 300, but if we consider variables x, y, z such that x = a, y = b, z = c, then we can think in terms of symmetric polynomials.
however, note that in equation 2, we have 100(ab + ac + bc) - abc = 2,000,000.
let me denote s = ab + ac + bc and p = abc.
then, the equations are: a + b + c = 300 s = ab + ac + bc p = abc
and the second equation is 100*s - p = 2,000,000.
so, p = 100*s - 2,000,000.
hmm.
so if we can relate s and p, perhaps using inequalities or other identities.
for nonnegative integers a, b, c, we know that (a + b + c)^2 = a2 + b2 + c2 + 2(ab + ac + bc).
so, 3002 = (a2 + b2 + c2) + 2s.
thus, 90,000 = a2 + b2 + c2 + 2s, so a2 + b2 + c2 = 90,000 - 2s.
but i don't know if that helps.
alternatively, maybe we can use the identity: (a + b + c)^3 = a3 + b3 + c3 + 6abc + 3(a2b + a2c + b2a + b2c + c2a + c2b)
wait, let me check that.
yes, if we expand (a + b + c)^3, the total terms are: a3 + b3 + c3 + 3(a2b + a2c + b2a + b2c + c2a + c2b) + 6abc.
so, (a + b + c)^3 = a3 + b3 + c3 + 3(a2b + a2c + b2a + b2c + c2a + c2b) + 6abc
but we know a + b + c = 300, so 300^3 = 27,000,000.
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>
<goal>
<outline>
1: the value of the sum of cubes of the variables.
</outline>

2: the value of the sum of the terms a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b.

2: the sum of the terms a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b is given as 6,000,000.
</path>
<conclusion>
the sum of the cubes of the variables is denoted by c, and the sum of the terms a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b is 6,000,000.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
so, 27,000,000 = c + 3*6,000,000 + 6abc
calculate that: 27,000,000 = c + 18,000,000 + 6abc
therefore, c + 6abc = 9,000,000
but we also know from equation 2 that 100 s - abc = 2,000,000, so maybe we can express abc in terms of s: abc = 100 s - 2,000,000
so, substituting into c + 6abc = 9,000,000: c + 6*(100 s - 2,000,000) = 9,000,000
so, c + 600 s - 12,000,000 = 9,000,000
therefore, c + 600 s = 21,000,000
but c is a3 + b3 + c3.
hmm.
alternatively, another identity: a3 + b3 + c3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a2 + b2 + c2 - ab - ac - bc)
so, a3 + b3 + c3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)((a2 + b2 + c2 - ab - ac - bc))
but we can write a2 + b2 + c2 in terms of s: from (a + b + c)^2 = a2 + b2 + c2 + 2s, so a2 + b2 + c2 = 90,000 - 2s.
therefore, a2 + b2 + c2 - ab - ac - bc = (90,000 - 2s) - s = 90,000 - 3s.
therefore, a3 + b3 + c3 - 3abc = 300*(90,000 - 3s)
so, a3 + b3 + c3 = 300*(90,000 - 3s) + 3abc
but we already have a3 + b3 + c3 = c, which from earlier equation is c = 9,000,000 - 6abc
wait, from c + 6abc = 9,000,000, so c = 9,000,000 - 6abc
therefore, equate the two expressions for a3 + b3 + c3: 300*(90,000 - 3s) + 3abc = 9,000,000 - 6abc
let's compute left-hand side: 300*90,000 - 300*3s + 3abc = 27,000,000 - 900s + 3abc
set equal to right-hand side: 27,000,000 - 900s + 3abc = 9,000,000 - 6abc
bring all terms to left-hand side: 27,000,000 - 900s + 3abc - 9,000,000 + 6abc = 0
simplify: (27,000,000 - 9,000,000) + (-900s) + (3abc + 6abc) = 18,000,000 - 900s + 9abc = 0
divide both sides by 9: 2,000,000 - 100s + abc = 0
therefore, abc = 100s - 2,000,000
which matches our earlier result from the second equation.
so that's consistent.
so, perhaps all these identities lead us back to the same equation.
so maybe this approach isn't the best.
let me think of another way.
given that a + b + c = 300 and 100s - abc = 2,000,000, where s = ab + ac + bc.
let me try to find possible values of a, b, c.
let's consider possible scenarios where the equations hold.
first, suppose that two of the variables are equal, and the third is different.
for example, let a = b, and c be different.
maybe symmetry would lead us to some solutions.
let's assume a = b, and see if we can find c.
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>
<goal>
<outline>
1: the number of solutions where two variables are equal (a=b) and the third is different.
</outline>
<outline>
2: the number of solutions where all three variables are equal.
</outline>
</goal>
<path>
1: let me set a = b.
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>
<goal>
<outline>
1.1: the expression for s = ab + ac + bc under the condition a=b.
</outline>
<outline>
1.2: the expression for abc under the condition a=b.
</outline>
</goal>
<path>
1.1: let me set a = b.
then, since a + b + c = 300, that becomes 2a + c = 300, so c = 300 - 2a.
</path>
<path>
1.2: the product abc becomes a^2c.
</path>
<conclusion>
under the condition a=b, s simplifies to a^2 + 2ac, and abc simplifies to a^2c.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
then, s = ab + ac + bc.
since a = b, s = a2 + a(300 - 2a) + a(300 - 2a) = a2 + a(300 - 2a) * 2
wait, ab = a2, ac = a(300 - 2a), bc = a(300 - 2a).
so s = a2 + 2a(300 - 2a) = a2 + 600a - 4a2 = -3a2 + 600a
therefore, s = -3a2 + 600a.
then, abc = a2(300 - 2a) = 300a2 - 2a3.
so, substituting into the second equation: 100s - abc = 2,000,000
so 100*(-3a2 + 600a) - (300a2 - 2a3) = 2,000,000
compute left-hand side: -300a2 + 60,000a - 300a2 + 2a3 = 2a3 - 600a2 + 60,000a
set equal to 2,000,000: 2a3 - 600a2 + 60,000a - 2,000,000 = 0
divide both sides by 2: a3 - 300a2 + 30,000a - 1,000,000 = 0
hmm, maybe factor this polynomial.
let me see if there's an integer root.
possible rational roots would be divisors of 1,000,000.
given that a has to be an integer between 0 and 150 (since 2a ≤ 300).
so a is from 0 to 150.
let me try a = 100.
compute 1003 - 300*1002 + 30,000*100 - 1,000,000
= 1,000,000 - 300*10,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000
= 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 0.
so a = 100 is a root.
therefore, (a - 100) is a factor.
let me perform polynomial division to factor it.
divide a3 - 300a2 + 30,000a - 1,000,000 by (a - 100).
using synthetic division: 100 | 1 -300 30,000 -1,000,000 | 100 -200 10,000 1 -200 29,800 0
wait, that gives: 1*a2 + (-300 + 100)*a + (30,000 - 200*100) ? wait, maybe let me set up synthetic division properly.
since we're dividing by (a - 100), the root is 100.
coefficients: 1 (a3), -300 (a2), 30,000 (a), -1,000,000 (constant).
bring down the 1.
multiply by 100: 100.
add to -300: -200.
multiply by 100: -20,000.
add to 30,000: 10,000.
multiply by 100: 1,000,000.
add to -1,000,000: 0.
so the quotient is a2 - 200a + 10,000.
therefore, factoring: (a - 100)(a2 - 200a + 10,000) = 0
the quadratic factors further: a2 - 200a + 10,000 = (a - 100)^2
because discriminant is 40,000 - 40,000 = 0.
so, it's a perfect square.
thus, the equation factors as (a - 100)^3 = 0.
therefore, a = 100 is the only real root, with multiplicity 3.
therefore, the only solution in this case is a = 100.
then, since a = b, and c = 300 - 2a = 300 - 200 = 100.
so the triple is (100, 100, 100).
let's think in parallel.

</path>
<conclusion>
the triple (100, 100, 100) satisfies both the sum equation a+b+c=300 and the second equation a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
so that works.
therefore, when a = b = c, the triple (100, 100, 100) is a solution.
but since the problem asks for all triples, including permutations, but in this case all three are equal, so the only triple is (100,100,100).
but maybe there are other solutions where two variables are equal and the third different.
wait, but in our assumption that a = b, the only solution was all equal.
so perhaps there are no other solutions with two variables equal.
alternatively, maybe other triples where all three variables are different.
alternatively, let's think about the equations again.
we have a + b + c = 300 and 100s - abc = 2,000,000.
since s = ab + ac + bc, and abc = p.
perhaps we can relate s and p in some other way.
alternatively, maybe assume that two variables are equal and the third is different, leading to symmetric equations.
wait, but when we assumed a = b, we only got the solution where a = b = c.
so maybe all solutions must have a = b = c?
let's see.
suppose a, b, c are not all equal.
let me check if there can be solutions.
suppose two variables are equal, say a = b, and c different.
as before, 2a + c = 300, and 100(a2 + 2ac) - a2c = 2,000,000.
which simplified to the cubic equation we had earlier.
but in that case, the only solution was a = 100, c = 100.
so if a = b, then c must also equal 100.
thus, no solutions with two variables equal and the third different.
therefore, perhaps the only solution is the triple (100,100,100).
but wait, the problem says "nonnegative integers (a,b,c)", so permutations are included, but in this case, all are the same.
so the triple is the same under permutation.
but maybe there are solutions where all three variables are distinct.
hmm.
how can we check that?
alternatively, perhaps express abc in terms of s: from equation 2: abc = 100s - 2,000,000.
we also have the identity: (ab + bc + ca)^2 >= 3abc, which is am-gm.
but let me check.
wait, am-gm gives (ab + bc + ca)/3 >= (ab * bc * ca)^{1/3} = (a^2 b^2 c^2)^{1/3} = (abc)^{2/3}
so, (ab + bc + ca)^3 >= 3^3 (abc)^2
so s^3 >= 27 (abc)^2
but from equation 2, abc = 100s - 2,000,000.
substitute: s^3 >= 27(100s - 2,000,000)^2
but this might not be solvable, but maybe gives a bound on s.
alternatively, let's see.
if abc = 100s - 2,000,000, then substituting into the inequality: s^3 >= 27(100s - 2,000,000)^2
let me see if s = ab + bc + ca, and we have a + b + c = 300.
maybe another approach is to use cauchy-schwarz.
for example, (ab + ac + bc)^2 <= (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)(b^2 + c^2 + a^2) but not sure.
alternatively, use the fact that for nonnegative reals, (a + b + c)^2 >= 3(ab + ac + bc).
wait, actually: (a + b + c)^2 = a2 + b2 + c2 + 2(ab + ac + bc) >= 3(ab + ac + bc)
because since a2 + b2 + c2 >= ab + ac + bc, so: 2(ab + ac + bc) + (ab + ac + bc) <= (a2 + b2 + c2) + 2(ab + ac + bc) = (a + b + c)^2 = 90,000
therefore, 3s <= 90,000 => s <= 30,000
equality when a = b = c, so s = 3*a*b, but when a = b = c, ab + ac + bc = 3a2, where a = 100, so s = 3*1002 = 30,000.
so maximum s is 30,000 when a = b = c = 100.
similarly, the minimum s?
the minimum s occurs when two variables are as unequal as possible.
for example, when one variable is 300 and others are 0.
then s = 0.
but let's check.
if a = 300, b = 0, c = 0, then s = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0.
so s can be between 0 and 30,000.
but given our equation 100s - abc = 2,000,000, we can note that abc = 100s - 2,000,000.
since abc must be a nonnegative integer (as a, b, c are nonnegative integers), so 100s - 2,000,000 must be nonnegative.
thus, 100s >= 2,000,000 => s >= 20,000.
therefore, ab + bc + ca >= 20,000.
so s >= 20,000.
thus, combined with the earlier inequality that s <= 30,000, so s is between 20,000 and 30,000.
hmm.
so s is between 20,000 and 30,000.
so abc = 100s - 2,000,000.
so abc is 100*20,000 - 2,000,000 = 0 up to 100*30,000 - 2,000,000 = 10,000,000 - 2,000,000 = 8,000,000.
wait, but when s is maximum (30,000), abc = 1,000,000.
wait, wait: abc = 100*30,000 - 2,000,000 = 3,000,000 - 2,000,000 = 1,000,000.
wait, maybe miscalculation.
wait, 100*s - 2,000,000.
so if s = 30,000, then abc = 100*30,000 - 2,000,000 = 3,000,000 - 2,000,000 = 1,000,000.
so when a = b = c = 100, abc = 100*100*100 = 1,000,000, which matches.
so in that case, abc = 1,000,000.
but when s is minimal (s=20,000), abc = 100*20,000 - 2,000,000 = 2,000,000 - 2,000,000 = 0.
so abc = 0.
so when s=20,000, abc=0.
so possible?
for example, if two variables are zero, say a = 300, b = 0, c = 0, then s = 0, but that gives abc = 0 = 100*0 - 2,000,000, which would require abc = -2,000,000.
which is impossible since abc is nonnegative.
so s must be at least 20,000.
so how can abc = 0?
if any of a, b, c is zero.
let me check.
suppose abc = 0.
then, 100s - 0 = 2,000,000 => s = 20,000.
so if abc = 0, then s = 20,000.
so is there a solution with one variable zero and s = 20,000?
let's suppose c = 0.
then, a + b = 300, and s = ab + a*0 + b*0 = ab.
so ab = 20,000.
so, we need a and b nonnegative integers such that a + b = 300 and ab = 20,000.

1.1: for two nonnegative integers a and b satisfying a + b = 300, their product ab can be maximized when a and b are equal, specifically a = b = 150, resulting in a maximum product of 22,500. this maximum product value of 22,500 is greater than the required product of 20,000. the product ab = 20,000 is therefore achievable. the quadratic equation x^2 - 300x + 20,000 = 0 is formed, with roots x = [300 ± sqrt(300^2 - 4*1*20,000)] / 2. the discriminant is calculated as 90,000 - 80,000 = 10,000. the roots are x = [300 ± 100] / 2, which are x = 200 or x = 100. this yields the integer solutions (a, b) = (200, 100) or (100, 200).
