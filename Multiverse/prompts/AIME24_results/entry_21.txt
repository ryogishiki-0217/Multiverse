Okay, so I need to solve this problem about finding the least integer \( b \ge 2 \) for which there are more than ten \( b \)-beautiful integers.
Let me first make sure I understand the definition correctly.
A positive integer \( n \) is called \( b \)-beautiful if it meets two conditions:
1. When expressed in base \( b \), it has exactly two digits.
2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of \( n \).
The example given is that 81 is 13-beautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as \( 63_{13} \), and the digits 6 and 3 add up to 9, which is \( \sqrt{81} \).
So, my task is to find the smallest base \( b \) where there are more than ten such numbers.
First, let me recall that a two-digit number in base \( b \) can be expressed as \( n = a \cdot b + c \), where \( a \) and \( c \) are the digits in base \( b \), so \( a \) and \( c \) must satisfy \( 1 \le a \le b-1 \) and \( 0 \le c \le b-1 \).
The condition for being \( b \)-beautiful is that the sum of these digits, \( a + c \), equals \( \sqrt{n} \).
Since \( n = a \cdot b + c \), we can substitute this into the equation:
\( \sqrt{a \cdot b + c} = a + c \)
Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:
\( a \cdot b + c = (a + c)^2 \)
Expanding the right side:
\( a \cdot b + c = a^2 + 2 a c + c^2 \)
Rearranging terms to bring everything to one side:
\( a^2 + 2 a c + c^2 - a b - c = 0 \)
Simplify:
\( a^2 + 2 a c + c^2 - a b - c = 0 \)
Hmm, maybe this is getting too complicated.
Let me think if there's a better approach.
Since \( n \) is a two-digit number in base \( b \), it must satisfy \( b \le n \le b(b-1) + (b-1) = b^2 - 1 \).
So, \( n \) is between \( b \) and \( b^2 - 1 \).
Moreover, since \( n \) is a perfect square (because \( \sqrt{n} \) must be an integer), we can say that \( n \) must be a perfect square in this range.
Let me rephrase the problem:
We need to find base \( b \) such that there are more than ten perfect squares \( n \) in the range \( [b, b^2 - 1] \), each of which, when written as \( n = a \cdot b + c \) with \( 1 \le a \le b-1 \) and \( 0 \le c \le b-1 \), satisfy \( a + c = \sqrt{n} \).
So, for each perfect square \( k^2 \) in the range \( [\lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil, \lfloor \sqrt{b^2 - 1} \rfloor] \), which simplifies to \( [\lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil, b - 1] \), since \( \sqrt{b^2 - 1} \) is slightly less than \( b \).
Therefore, \( k \) ranges from \( \lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil \) to \( b - 1 \).
For each such \( k \), we need to check if there exist digits \( a \) and \( c \) in base \( b \) such that:
1. \( k = a + c \)
2. \( k^2 = a \cdot b + c \)
So, substituting \( c = k - a \) into the second equation:
\( k^2 = a \cdot b + (k - a) \)
Simplify:
\( k^2 = a \cdot b + k - a \)
\( k^2 = a (b - 1) + k \)
Rearranging for \( a \):
\( a (b - 1) = k^2 - k \)
\( a = \frac{k^2 - k}{b - 1} \)
Since \( a \) must be an integer between 1 and \( b - 1 \), this gives us a condition on \( k \): \( k^2 - k \) must be divisible by \( b - 1 \), and the resulting \( a \) must satisfy \( 1 \le a \le b - 1 \).
Also, since \( c = k - a \), \( c \) must be between 0 and \( b - 1 \).
So, given \( k \), we can compute \( a \) as \( \frac{k(k - 1)}{b - 1} \), and check if \( a \) is an integer, and then check if \( c = k - a \) is in the valid range.
Therefore, for each \( k \) from \( \lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil \) to \( b - 1 \), we can check if \( (b - 1) \) divides \( k(k - 1) \), and then compute \( a \) and check the conditions on \( a \) and \( c \).
Alternatively, since \( a = \frac{k(k - 1)}{b - 1} \), and \( 1 \le a \le b - 1 \), then:
\( 1 \le \frac{k(k - 1)}{b - 1} \le b - 1 \)
Multiplying through by \( b - 1 \) (which is positive since \( b \ge 2 \)):
\( b - 1 \le k(k - 1) \le (b - 1)^2 \)
So, for each \( k \), \( k(k - 1) \) must be between \( b - 1 \) and \( (b - 1)^2 \), and divisible by \( b - 1 \).
Therefore, to find the number of \( b \)-beautiful numbers, for a given \( b \), we can:
1. Compute the range of \( k \): from \( \lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil \) to \( b - 1 \).
2. For each \( k \) in this range, check if \( k(k - 1) \) is divisible by \( b - 1 \).
3. For each such \( k \), compute \( a = \frac{k(k - 1)}{b - 1} \) and check if \( 1 \le a \le b - 1 \) and \( 0 \le c = k - a \le b - 1 \).
4. Count how many such \( k \) exist, and find the least \( b \) where this count exceeds 10.
Alternatively, perhaps we can rephrase the divisibility condition.
Let me denote \( d = b - 1 \).
Then, the condition becomes \( a = \frac{k(k - 1)}{d} \), which must be integer.
So, \( d \) divides \( k(k - 1) \).
Since \( k \) and \( k - 1 \) are coprime, \( d \) must divide either \( k \) or \( k - 1 \).
But not necessarily; for example, if \( d \) is 6, \( k(k - 1) \) might have factors from both \( k \) and \( k - 1 \).
But perhaps breaking down \( d \) into its factors could help.
But maybe approaching this by fixing \( d = b - 1 \), then we can look for \( k \) such that \( k(k - 1) \equiv 0 \mod d \).
The number of such \( k \) in the range \( [\lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil, b - 1] \) would give the number of \( b \)-beautiful numbers.
So, perhaps for each \( d \), starting from \( d = 1 \) (since \( b - 1 = 1 \) when \( b = 2 \)), we can compute how many \( k \) satisfy \( k(k - 1) \equiv 0 \mod d \), with \( k \) in \( [\lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil, b - 1] \), which translates to \( [\lceil \sqrt{d + 1} \rceil, d] \).
Wait, since \( b = d + 1 \), so the upper bound for \( k \) is \( d \), and the lower bound is \( \lceil \sqrt{d + 1} \rceil \).
So, for each \( d \ge 1 \), we can compute the number of integers \( k \) in \( [\lceil \sqrt{d + 1} \rceil, d] \) such that \( k(k - 1) \equiv 0 \mod d \).
We need to find the smallest \( d \) (hence \( b = d + 1 \)) for which there are more than 10 such \( k \).
Alternatively, since \( k \le d \), we can consider \( k \) in \( 1, 2, ..., d \), but we have to adjust the range based on \( \lceil \sqrt{d + 1} \rceil \).
But maybe it's easier to start testing small values of \( d \) (hence small \( b \)) and count upwards until we find the first \( d \) where the count exceeds 10.
But this could be time-consuming.
Let me try to see if there's a pattern or formula.
Alternatively, notice that in the equation \( k^2 = a b + c \) and \( k = a + c \), substituting \( c = k - a \), we get:
\( k^2 = a b + (k - a) = a(b - 1) + k \)
Therefore, rearranged:
\( k^2 - k = a(b - 1) \)
Which gives:
\( a = \frac{k^2 - k}{b - 1} \)
As before.
So, \( a \) must be an integer.
Therefore, \( b - 1 \) must divide \( k^2 - k \).
So, for each \( k \), check if \( b - 1 \) divides \( k(k - 1) \).
Then, \( a \) must be at least 1 and at most \( b - 1 \), and \( c = k - a \) must be between 0 and \( b - 1 \).
Since \( a = \frac{k(k - 1)}{b - 1} \), then:
From \( a \le b - 1 \):
\( \frac{k(k - 1)}{b - 1} \le b - 1 \)
Which implies:
\( k(k - 1) \le (b - 1)^2 \)
But since \( k \le b - 1 \), the maximum \( k(k - 1) \) is \((b - 1)(b - 2)\), which is indeed less than or equal to \((b - 1)^2 \).
So that condition is automatically satisfied.
For \( a \ge 1 \):
\( \frac{k(k - 1)}{b - 1} \ge 1 \)
So:
\( k(k - 1) \ge b - 1 \)
Therefore, combining the previous condition:
For \( a \) to be an integer in the correct range, \( k(k - 1) \ge b - 1 \), and \( k(k - 1) \) divisible by \( b - 1 \), and \( k \le b - 1 \).
Also, \( c = k - a = k - \frac{k(k - 1)}{b - 1} \).
Then, \( c \) must be between 0 and \( b - 1 \).
Let me check the condition on \( c \):
\( 0 \le k - \frac{k(k - 1)}{b - 1} \le b - 1 \)
Multiply through by \( b - 1 \):
\( 0 \le (b - 1)k - k(k - 1) \le (b - 1)^2 \)
Simplify the expression:
\( (b - 1)k - k(k - 1) = k(b - 1 - (k - 1)) = k(b - k) \)
Therefore, the inequality becomes:
\( 0 \le k(b - k) \le (b - 1)^2 \)
Since \( k \le b - 1 \), then \( b - k \ge 1 \), so \( k(b - k) \) is non-negative, and its maximum value is when \( k = \lfloor \frac{b}{2} \rfloor \) or \( \lceil \frac{b}{2} \rceil \).
But the upper bound is \( (b - 1)^2 \), which is larger than the maximum of \( k(b - k) \), which is \( \frac{b^2}{4} \) approximately.
Therefore, the inequality \( 0 \le k(b - k) \le (b - 1)^2 \) is automatically satisfied.
Therefore, the key constraints are:
1. \( k(k - 1) \) divisible by \( b - 1 \)
2. \( k(k - 1) \ge b - 1 \)
3. \( k \le b - 1 \)
4. \( k \ge \lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil \)
Therefore, for a given \( b \), the number of \( k \) in \( [\lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil, b - 1] \) such that \( k(k - 1) \equiv 0 \mod (b - 1) \).
Alternatively, if we let \( d = b - 1 \), then we need \( k(k - 1) \equiv 0 \mod d \), with \( k \) in \( [\lceil \sqrt{d + 1} \rceil, d] \).
So, for each \( d \), count the number of \( k \) in that range where \( k(k - 1) \equiv 0 \mod d \).
Our goal is to find the minimal \( d \) (hence \( b = d + 1 \)) such that this count exceeds 10.
Alternatively, perhaps look for values of \( d \) where \( d \) divides \( k(k - 1) \).
Since \( d \) and \( k \), \( k - 1 \) are consecutive integers, \( d \) and \( k \) share a common factor, or \( d \) and \( k - 1 \) share a common factor.
But this might not directly help.
Alternatively, for each \( d \), we can precompute how many \( k \) in \( 1, 2, ..., d \) satisfy \( k(k - 1) \equiv 0 \mod d \), and then subtract those \( k \) less than \( \sqrt{d + 1} \).
But actually, since \( k \) has to be at least \( \lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil = \lceil \sqrt{d + 1} \rceil \).
But maybe another approach: since \( k(k - 1) \equiv 0 \mod d \), this implies that \( k \equiv 0 \mod d \) or \( k \equiv 1 \mod d \), but that's not necessarily true.
For example, if \( d = 6 \), then \( k(k - 1) \equiv 0 \mod 6 \) if either \( k \equiv 0 \mod 2 \) and \( k - 1 \equiv 0 \mod 3 \), or \( k \equiv 0 \mod 3 \) and \( k - 1 \equiv 0 \mod 2 \).
So, in general, \( k(k - 1) \equiv 0 \mod d \) if for each prime power \( p^e \) dividing \( d \), either \( k \equiv 0 \mod p^e \) or \( k \equiv 1 \mod p^e \).
Therefore, the solutions to \( k(k - 1) \equiv 0 \mod d \) are the integers \( k \) such that for each prime power \( p^e \) in the factorization of \( d \), \( k \equiv 0 \) or \( 1 \mod p^e \).
The number of such \( k \) modulo \( d \) is \( 2^m \), where \( m \) is the number of distinct prime factors of \( d \).
Wait, but this is if the prime powers are pairwise coprime, which they are not necessarily.
For example, if \( d = p^e \), then solutions are \( k \equiv 0 \) or \( 1 \mod p^e \).
If \( d = p^e q^f \), then by Chinese Remainder Theorem, number of solutions is 4.
But in general, if \( d \) has prime power factorization \( p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_m^{e_m} \), then the number of solutions to \( k(k - 1) \equiv 0 \mod d \) is \( 2^m \), but this is only if each modulus \( p_i^{e_i} \) allows two solutions, and they can be combined.
However, if the prime powers are not pairwise coprime, which they would be as parts of the factorization, actually, since \( d \) is a product of distinct primes, wait, no.
If \( d \) is divisible by \( p^2 \), then solving \( k(k - 1) \equiv 0 \mod p^2 \) has solutions \( k \equiv 0 \mod p^2 \) or \( k \equiv 1 \mod p^2 \), but if \( d \) is square-free, then each prime factor contributes a factor of 2.
But even so, the total number is \( 2^m \), where \( m \) is the number of distinct prime factors of \( d \).
Wait, maybe not.
Let me check with an example.
Take \( d = 6 = 2 \times 3 \).
Then solving \( k(k - 1) \equiv 0 \mod 6 \).
By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, this is equivalent to solving \( k(k - 1) \equiv 0 \mod 2 \) and \( k(k - 1) \equiv 0 \mod 3 \).
For mod 2: Either \( k \equiv 0 \mod 2 \) or \( k \equiv 1 \mod 2 \).
Wait, but \( k(k - 1) \equiv 0 \mod 2 \) is always true because either \( k \) or \( k - 1 \) is even.
Similarly, \( k(k - 1) \equiv 0 \mod 3 \) is equivalent to \( k \equiv 0 \mod 3 \) or \( 1 \mod 3 \).
Therefore, mod 3, solutions are \( k \equiv 0, 1 \mod 3 \), and mod 2, solutions are all \( k \), since product of two consecutive numbers is always even.
So, combining with CRT, the solutions mod 6 would be \( k \equiv 0, 1, 3, 4 \mod 6 \).
So four solutions, which is \( 2 \times 2 = 2^2 \), since two prime factors.
But if \( d \) has prime factors \( p, q \), then number of solutions is 4.
Wait, but if \( d = pq \) with p and q distinct odd primes, then \( k(k - 1) \equiv 0 \mod pq \) is equivalent to \( k(k - 1) \equiv 0 \mod p \) and \( k(k - 1) \equiv 0 \mod q \).
Each equation mod p and q has two solutions, so total solutions mod pq is 4 by CRT.
Therefore, for square-free d with m distinct prime factors, the number of solutions to \( k(k - 1) \equiv 0 \mod d \) is \( 2^m \).
However, in the case where d is a prime power, say \( d = p^e \), the number of solutions is 2: \( k \equiv 0 \) or \( 1 \mod p^e \).
Therefore, if d is a prime power, there are two solutions.
If d is a product of m distinct primes, there are \( 2^m \) solutions.
But this might not hold if primes are repeated, but d is square-free here.
Wait, but in the example with d=6, which is square-free with two primes, we have 4 solutions.
So perhaps the number of solutions is indeed \( 2^m \), where m is the number of distinct prime factors.
However, in the case where d is divisible by a higher power, say d=4, then?
For d=4: \( k(k - 1) \equiv 0 \mod 4 \).
Since k and k-1 are coprime, so either k ≡ 0 mod 4 or k ≡ 1 mod 4.
Because if k ≡ 0 mod 4, then k ≡ 0 mod 4.
If k ≡1 mod 4, then k-1 ≡0 mod 4.
But since 4 is a prime power, the solutions are k ≡0 or 1 mod 4, so two solutions.
Similarly, if d=9, a prime power, solutions k ≡0 or 1 mod 9.
Therefore, prime power d: 2 solutions.
Square-free d with m prime factors: 2^m solutions.
Wait, but in the case where d is 12=4*3.
Then, d=12=4*3.
Then, solving \( k(k - 1) ≡0 mod 12 \) is equivalent to solving \( k(k - 1) ≡0 mod 4 \) and \( k(k - 1) ≡0 mod 3 \).
For mod 4: k ≡0 or 1 mod 4.
For mod 3: k ≡0 or 1 mod 3.
Combining these with CRT.
Each combination gives a solution mod 12.
So 2*2=4 solutions.
But let's check:
For mod 4: k ≡0,1; for mod 3: k≡0,1.
Thus, possible combinations:
1. k ≡0 mod 4 and 0 mod 3: k ≡0 mod 12
2. k ≡0 mod 4 and 1 mod 3: Chinese Remainder Theorem. Solve 0 mod 4 and 1 mod 3.
Let’s see: numbers 0,4,8 mod 12: check 0 mod 3 is 0; 4 mod 3 =1; 8 mod 3=2.
So 4 is 1 mod 3.
So k≡4 mod 12.
3. k≡1 mod4 and 0 mod3: Solve k≡1 mod4 and 0 mod3.
Check numbers 0,3,6,9 mod12.
3 mod4=3, 6 mod4=2, 9 mod4=1.
So 9 mod4=1, so k≡9 mod12.
4. k≡1 mod4 and 1 mod3: k≡1 mod12.
So solutions are k≡0,1,4,9 mod12.
Therefore, 4 solutions.
Thus, even though 12 is not square-free (it has a square factor 4), the number of solutions is 4, which is 2^2, since it has two distinct prime factors.
So perhaps the formula is indeed \( 2^m \), where m is the number of distinct prime factors, even if d is not square-free.
But only the number of distinct primes, not the exponents.
Wait, but let's check d=18=2*3^2.
Then d=18, prime factors are 2 and 3.
So number of solutions should be 2^2=4?
Let's check:
Solve \( k(k - 1) ≡0 mod 18 \).
This requires that 2 | k(k -1) and 9 |k(k -1).
Since 2 and 9 are coprime.
For mod 2: as before, always true.
For mod 9: k ≡0 or 1 mod9.
Therefore, combining with mod2, which is automatic, the solutions mod18 would be k≡0,1 mod9, same as mod 9?
Wait, no.
Wait, mod9 solutions are k≡0,1 mod9.
Then, since mod2 is already satisfied (as k(k-1) is even), we can take k≡0,1 mod9, and then translate to mod18.
For k≡0 mod9: k=0,9 mod18.
For k≡1 mod9: k=1,10 mod18.
So solutions mod18 are 0,1,9,10.
Therefore, four solutions.
Thus, 2^2=4, which is the number of distinct prime factors (2 and 3).
So even with higher powers, like 9 here, the number is still 4.
So the number of solutions is indeed \( 2^m \), where m is the number of distinct prime factors of d.
So, for a general d, if d has m distinct prime factors, then the number of solutions to \( k(k - 1) ≡0 \mod d \) is \( 2^m \).
Wait, but hold on, in the case d=4, m=1 (only prime factor 2), and solutions are 2, which fits \( 2^1 \).
For d=6, m=2 (prime factors 2,3), solutions 4, which is \( 2^2 \).
For d=12, m=2 (prime factors 2,3), solutions 4.
For d=18, same.
For d=30=2*3*5, m=3, then solutions would be 8.
Let me check d=30.
Then solving \( k(k - 1) ≡0 \mod 30 \).
This requires k(k -1) ≡0 mod2, 3, and 5.
Mod2: automatic.
Mod3: k≡0 or1 mod3.
Mod5: k≡0 or1 mod5.
So by CRT, number of solutions is 2 (mod3) * 2 (mod5) = 4 mod15, but combined with mod2, but k can be 0 or1 mod2 as well, but since the product is always even, does that add more solutions?
Wait, no.
The Chinese Remainder Theorem would combine mod3, mod2, mod5.
Wait, maybe I need to compute it properly.
d=30.
Solutions to k(k -1) ≡0 mod30 are those k where:
- k ≡0 or1 mod3
- k ≡0 or1 mod5
- k is arbitrary mod2, because k(k -1) is always even.
Therefore, mod2 gives no restriction, as the product is always even.
So the solutions are determined by their residues mod3 and mod5.
Each combination of residues:
For mod3: 0 or1 (2 choices)
For mod5: 0 or1 (2 choices)
So total solutions mod15 (since mod3 and mod5) are 2*2=4.
Then, since mod2 is independent and can be 0 or1, does that double the number?
Wait, no.
Because mod2 is already factored into the product.
Wait, actually, mod30, since 30=2*3*5.
So solving the congruences for mod2, mod3, mod5.
For mod3 and mod5, as before, 0 or1.
For mod2, no restriction, since product is even.
Wait, but k(k -1) ≡0 mod2 is always true, so in fact, the solutions are those k where:
- mod3: k≡0 or1
- mod5: k≡0 or1
- mod2: any
Therefore, the number of solutions mod30 would be 2 (mod3 choices) * 2 (mod5 choices) * 1 (mod2, already enforced by k(k-1) being even).
Wait, but let's use CRT properly.
Each choice of residues mod3 and mod5 (0 or1) can be combined with any residue mod2.
But since k(k -1) must be divisible by 30=2*3*5, and since k and k-1 are consecutive integers, one is even.
So for mod2, it's automatically satisfied.
Therefore, for mod3 and mod5, each has two choices, leading to 4 combinations.
Each combination can be lifted to mod30 using CRT.
Therefore, the number of solutions is 4.
Wait, but 4 solutions would be:
1. k ≡0 mod3, 0 mod5 ⇒ k≡0 mod15 ⇒ k≡0 or15 mod30
2. k≡0 mod3, 1 mod5 ⇒ Solve k≡0 mod3, k≡1 mod5.
For example, k=21 mod15 ⇒ 21 mod30?
Wait, let me solve k≡0 mod3 and k≡1 mod5.
Let k=5m +1.
Then 5m +1 ≡0 mod3 ⇒5m≡-1 mod3⇒ 2m≡2 mod3⇒m≡1 mod3.
So m=3t +1.
Thus, k=5(3t +1) +1=15t +6.
So k≡6 mod15 ⇒k≡6 or21 mod30.
3. k≡1 mod3, 0 mod5 ⇒ solve k≡1 mod3 and k≡0 mod5.
Let k=3m +1.
Then 3m +1≡0 mod5 ⇒3m≡-1 mod5⇒3m≡4 mod5⇒ m≡ 3^{-1}*4 mod5.
3*2=6≡1 mod5, so inverse is 2.
Thus, m≡ 2*4=8≡3 mod5.
So m=5t +3.
Thus, k=3*(5t +3)+1=15t +10.
So k≡10 mod15 ⇒k≡10 or25 mod30.
4. k≡1 mod3, 1 mod5 ⇒k≡1 mod15 ⇒k≡1 or16 mod30.
But wait, these are four solutions:
1. k≡0,15 mod30
2. k≡6,21 mod30
3. k≡10,25 mod30
4. k≡1,16 mod30
But each of these are two residues, so total 8 residues?
Wait, no.
For each of the four combinations mod15, each gives two residues mod30:
0 mod15: 0,15
6 mod15:6,21
10 mod15:10,25
1 mod15:1,16
So total 8 solutions mod30.
But d=30, so k from 1 to30, giving 8 solutions.
Therefore, the number of solutions is 8=2^3?
But d=30 has three distinct prime factors (2,3,5), so m=3, and 2^3=8.
Wait, so the formula is actually \( 2^m \), where m is the number of distinct prime factors of d, even if one of them is 2?
But in the case of d=30, the prime factors are 2,3,5, so three primes, but since for modulus 2, the equation is always true, you might think it doesn't contribute, but in reality, when applying CRT across all primes, even with the factor 2, the number of solutions is \( 2^m \), where m is the number of distinct prime factors.
Wait, but in the case of d=6 (primes 2,3), number of solutions is 4=2^2, as before.
For d=30 (primes 2,3,5), solutions=8=2^3.
Wait, but in d=30, even with three prime factors, you get 8 solutions.
So, perhaps the formula is indeed \( 2^m \), where m is the number of distinct prime factors, including 2, but applied correctly.
Wait, but in the case where d=15=3*5 (two primes), the number of solutions is 4=2^2, which includes mod2 automatically.
Wait, but d=15, then k(k -1) ≡0 mod15.
Since 15=3*5.
Then, k(k -1) ≡0 mod3 and 0 mod5.
So k ≡0 or1 mod3, and 0 or1 mod5.
By CRT, 4 solutions mod15.
But 15 is 3*5, so m=2, giving 2^2=4.
If d=15, then in the range k=1 to15, how many solutions are there?
Let's compute:
For mod3: 0 or1.
For mod5:0 or1.
So possible k:
1. 0 mod3 and0 mod5:15k, but 0 mod15 is 0.
But k=1 to15, so 0 mod15 is 0,15.
But 0 is not in 1-15, so 15.
But k=15:15(14)=210.
210 mod15=0.
So k=15 is a solution.
2. 0 mod3 and1 mod5: Solve k≡0 mod3 and1 mod5.
Let’s solve k≡1 mod5, 0 mod3.
Let k=5m +1.
Then 5m +1≡0 mod3 ⇒5m≡-1 mod3⇒5m≡2 mod3⇒2m≡2 mod3⇒m≡1 mod3.
So m=3t +1.
k=5(3t +1)+1=15t +6.
So k=6,21, etc.
But k up to15: 6.
3. 1 mod3 and0 mod5: k≡0 mod5 and1 mod3.
Let k=5m.
Then 5m≡1 mod3⇒5m≡1 mod3⇒2m≡1 mod3⇒m≡2 mod3.
So m=3t +2.
k=5*(3t +2)=15t +10.
So k=10.
4. 1 mod3 and1 mod5: k≡1 mod both3 and5: k≡1 mod15.
So k=1.
So solutions for d=15 (mod15) are k=1,6,10,15.
But k=1:1*0=0 mod15, yes.
k=6:6*5=30≡0 mod15.
k=10:10*9=90≡0 mod15.
k=15:15*14=210≡0 mod15.
So four solutions.
So 4 solutions, which is 2^2, m=2 primes (3,5).
But d=15, so this fits.
But in this case, even though 2 is not a

solve the following math problem: let \(b\ge 2\) be an integer. call a positive integer \(n\) \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base \(b\)  and these two digits sum to \(\sqrt n\). for example, \(81\) is \(13\text-\textit{eautiful}\) because \(81  = \underline{6} \ \underline{3}_{13} \) and \(6 + 3 =  \sqrt{81}\). find the least integer \(b\ge 2\) for which there are more than ten \(b\text-\textit{eautiful}\) integers.

<think>
okay, so i need to solve this problem about finding the least integer \( b \ge 2 \) for which there are more than ten \( b \)-beautiful integers.
let me first make sure i understand the definition correctly.
a positive integer \( n \) is called \( b \)-beautiful if it meets two conditions:
1. when expressed in base \( b \), it has exactly two digits.
2. the sum of these two digits equals the square root of \( n \).
the example given is that 81 is 13-beautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as \( 63_{13} \), and the digits 6 and 3 add up to 9, which is \( \sqrt{81} \).
so, my task is to find the smallest base \( b \) where there are more than ten such numbers.
first, let me recall that a two-digit number in base \( b \) can be expressed as \( n = a \cdot b + c \), where \( a \) and \( c \) are the digits in base \( b \), so \( a \) and \( c \) must satisfy \( 1 \le a \le b-1 \) and \( 0 \le c \le b-1 \).
the condition for being \( b \)-beautiful is that the sum of these digits, \( a + c \), equals \( \sqrt{n} \).
since \( n = a \cdot b + c \), we can substitute this into the equation:
\( \sqrt{a \cdot b + c} = a + c \)
let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:
\( a \cdot b + c = (a + c)^2 \)
expanding the right side:
\( a \cdot b + c = a^2 + 2 a c + c^2 \)
rearranging terms to bring everything to one side:
\( a^2 + 2 a c + c^2 - a b - c = 0 \)
simplify:
\( a^2 + 2 a c + c^2 - a b - c = 0 \)
hmm, maybe this is getting too complicated.
let me think if there's a better approach.
since \( n \) is a two-digit number in base \( b \), it must satisfy \( b \le n \le b(b-1) + (b-1) = b^2 - 1 \).
so, \( n \) is between \( b \) and \( b^2 - 1 \).
moreover, since \( n \) is a perfect square (because \( \sqrt{n} \) must be an integer), we can say that \( n \) must be a perfect square in this range.
let me rephrase the problem:
we need to find base \( b \) such that there are more than ten perfect squares \( n \) in the range \( [b, b^2 - 1] \), each of which, when written as \( n = a \cdot b + c \) with \( 1 \le a \le b-1 \) and \( 0 \le c \le b-1 \), satisfy \( a + c = \sqrt{n} \).
so, for each perfect square \( k^2 \) in the range \( [\lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil, \lfloor \sqrt{b^2 - 1} \rfloor] \), which simplifies to \( [\lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil, b - 1] \), since \( \sqrt{b^2 - 1} \) is slightly less than \( b \).
therefore, \( k \) ranges from \( \lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil \) to \( b - 1 \).
for each such \( k \), we need to check if there exist digits \( a \) and \( c \) in base \( b \) such that:
1. \( k = a + c \)
2. \( k^2 = a \cdot b + c \)
so, substituting \( c = k - a \) into the second equation:
\( k^2 = a \cdot b + (k - a) \)
simplify:
\( k^2 = a \cdot b + k - a \)
\( k^2 = a (b - 1) + k \)
rearranging for \( a \):
\( a (b - 1) = k^2 - k \)
\( a = \frac{k^2 - k}{b - 1} \)
since \( a \) must be an integer between 1 and \( b - 1 \), this gives us a condition on \( k \): \( k^2 - k \) must be divisible by \( b - 1 \), and the resulting \( a \) must satisfy \( 1 \le a \le b - 1 \).
also, since \( c = k - a \), \( c \) must be between 0 and \( b - 1 \).
so, given \( k \), we can compute \( a \) as \( \frac{k(k - 1)}{b - 1} \), and check if \( a \) is an integer, and then check if \( c = k - a \) is in the valid range.
therefore, for each \( k \) from \( \lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil \) to \( b - 1 \), we can check if \( (b - 1) \) divides \( k(k - 1) \), and then compute \( a \) and check the conditions on \( a \) and \( c \).
alternatively, since \( a = \frac{k(k - 1)}{b - 1} \), and \( 1 \le a \le b - 1 \), then:
\( 1 \le \frac{k(k - 1)}{b - 1} \le b - 1 \)
multiplying through by \( b - 1 \) (which is positive since \( b \ge 2 \)):
\( b - 1 \le k(k - 1) \le (b - 1)^2 \)
so, for each \( k \), \( k(k - 1) \) must be between \( b - 1 \) and \( (b - 1)^2 \), and divisible by \( b - 1 \).
therefore, to find the number of \( b \)-beautiful numbers, for a given \( b \), we can:
1. compute the range of \( k \): from \( \lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil \) to \( b - 1 \).
2. for each \( k \) in this range, check if \( k(k - 1) \) is divisible by \( b - 1 \).
3. for each such \( k \), compute \( a = \frac{k(k - 1)}{b - 1} \) and check if \( 1 \le a \le b - 1 \) and \( 0 \le c = k - a \le b - 1 \).
4. count how many such \( k \) exist, and find the least \( b \) where this count exceeds 10.
alternatively, perhaps we can rephrase the divisibility condition.
let me denote \( d = b - 1 \).
then, the condition becomes \( a = \frac{k(k - 1)}{d} \), which must be integer.
so, \( d \) divides \( k(k - 1) \).
since \( k \) and \( k - 1 \) are coprime, \( d \) must divide either \( k \) or \( k - 1 \).
but not necessarily; for example, if \( d \) is 6, \( k(k - 1) \) might have factors from both \( k \) and \( k - 1 \).
but perhaps breaking down \( d \) into its factors could help.
but maybe approaching this by fixing \( d = b - 1 \), then we can look for \( k \) such that \( k(k - 1) \equiv 0 \mod d \).
the number of such \( k \) in the range \( [\lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil, b - 1] \) would give the number of \( b \)-beautiful numbers.
so, perhaps for each \( d \), starting from \( d = 1 \) (since \( b - 1 = 1 \) when \( b = 2 \)), we can compute how many \( k \) satisfy \( k(k - 1) \equiv 0 \mod d \), with \( k \) in \( [\lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil, b - 1] \), which translates to \( [\lceil \sqrt{d + 1} \rceil, d] \).
wait, since \( b = d + 1 \), so the upper bound for \( k \) is \( d \), and the lower bound is \( \lceil \sqrt{d + 1} \rceil \).
so, for each \( d \ge 1 \), we can compute the number of integers \( k \) in \( [\lceil \sqrt{d + 1} \rceil, d] \) such that \( k(k - 1) \equiv 0 \mod d \).
we need to find the smallest \( d \) (hence \( b = d + 1 \)) for which there are more than 10 such \( k \).
alternatively, since \( k \le d \), we can consider \( k \) in \( 1, 2, ..., d \), but we have to adjust the range based on \( \lceil \sqrt{d + 1} \rceil \).
but maybe it's easier to start testing small values of \( d \) (hence small \( b \)) and count upwards until we find the first \( d \) where the count exceeds 10.
but this could be time-consuming.
let me try to see if there's a pattern or formula.
alternatively, notice that in the equation \( k^2 = a b + c \) and \( k = a + c \), substituting \( c = k - a \), we get:
\( k^2 = a b + (k - a) = a(b - 1) + k \)
therefore, rearranged:
\( k^2 - k = a(b - 1) \)
which gives:
\( a = \frac{k^2 - k}{b - 1} \)
as before.
so, \( a \) must be an integer.
therefore, \( b - 1 \) must divide \( k^2 - k \).
so, for each \( k \), check if \( b - 1 \) divides \( k(k - 1) \).
then, \( a \) must be at least 1 and at most \( b - 1 \), and \( c = k - a \) must be between 0 and \( b - 1 \).
since \( a = \frac{k(k - 1)}{b - 1} \), then:
from \( a \le b - 1 \):
\( \frac{k(k - 1)}{b - 1} \le b - 1 \)
which implies:
\( k(k - 1) \le (b - 1)^2 \)
but since \( k \le b - 1 \), the maximum \( k(k - 1) \) is \((b - 1)(b - 2)\), which is indeed less than or equal to \((b - 1)^2 \).
so that condition is automatically satisfied.
for \( a \ge 1 \):
\( \frac{k(k - 1)}{b - 1} \ge 1 \)
so:
\( k(k - 1) \ge b - 1 \)
therefore, combining the previous condition:
for \( a \) to be an integer in the correct range, \( k(k - 1) \ge b - 1 \), and \( k(k - 1) \) divisible by \( b - 1 \), and \( k \le b - 1 \).
also, \( c = k - a = k - \frac{k(k - 1)}{b - 1} \).
then, \( c \) must be between 0 and \( b - 1 \).
let me check the condition on \( c \):
\( 0 \le k - \frac{k(k - 1)}{b - 1} \le b - 1 \)
multiply through by \( b - 1 \):
\( 0 \le (b - 1)k - k(k - 1) \le (b - 1)^2 \)
simplify the expression:
\( (b - 1)k - k(k - 1) = k(b - 1 - (k - 1)) = k(b - k) \)
therefore, the inequality becomes:
\( 0 \le k(b - k) \le (b - 1)^2 \)
since \( k \le b - 1 \), then \( b - k \ge 1 \), so \( k(b - k) \) is non-negative, and its maximum value is when \( k = \lfloor \frac{b}{2} \rfloor \) or \( \lceil \frac{b}{2} \rceil \).
but the upper bound is \( (b - 1)^2 \), which is larger than the maximum of \( k(b - k) \), which is \( \frac{b^2}{4} \) approximately.
therefore, the inequality \( 0 \le k(b - k) \le (b - 1)^2 \) is automatically satisfied.
therefore, the key constraints are:
1. \( k(k - 1) \) divisible by \( b - 1 \)
2. \( k(k - 1) \ge b - 1 \)
3. \( k \le b - 1 \)
4. \( k \ge \lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil \)
therefore, for a given \( b \), the number of \( k \) in \( [\lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil, b - 1] \) such that \( k(k - 1) \equiv 0 \mod (b - 1) \).
alternatively, if we let \( d = b - 1 \), then we need \( k(k - 1) \equiv 0 \mod d \), with \( k \) in \( [\lceil \sqrt{d + 1} \rceil, d] \).
so, for each \( d \), count the number of \( k \) in that range where \( k(k - 1) \equiv 0 \mod d \).
our goal is to find the minimal \( d \) (hence \( b = d + 1 \)) such that this count exceeds 10.
alternatively, perhaps look for values of \( d \) where \( d \) divides \( k(k - 1) \).
since \( d \) and \( k \), \( k - 1 \) are consecutive integers, \( d \) and \( k \) share a common factor, or \( d \) and \( k - 1 \) share a common factor.
but this might not directly help.
alternatively, for each \( d \), we can precompute how many \( k \) in \( 1, 2, ..., d \) satisfy \( k(k - 1) \equiv 0 \mod d \), and then subtract those \( k \) less than \( \sqrt{d + 1} \).
but actually, since \( k \) has to be at least \( \lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil = \lceil \sqrt{d + 1} \rceil \).
but maybe another approach: since \( k(k - 1) \equiv 0 \mod d \), this implies that \( k \equiv 0 \mod d \) or \( k \equiv 1 \mod d \), but that's not necessarily true.
for example, if \( d = 6 \), then \( k(k - 1) \equiv 0 \mod 6 \) if either \( k \equiv 0 \mod 2 \) and \( k - 1 \equiv 0 \mod 3 \), or \( k \equiv 0 \mod 3 \) and \( k - 1 \equiv 0 \mod 2 \).
so, in general, \( k(k - 1) \equiv 0 \mod d \) if for each prime power \( p^e \) dividing \( d \), either \( k \equiv 0 \mod p^e \) or \( k \equiv 1 \mod p^e \).
therefore, the solutions to \( k(k - 1) \equiv 0 \mod d \) are the integers \( k \) such that for each prime power \( p^e \) in the factorization of \( d \), \( k \equiv 0 \) or \( 1 \mod p^e \).
the number of such \( k \) modulo \( d \) is \( 2^m \), where \( m \) is the number of distinct prime factors of \( d \).
wait, but this is if the prime powers are pairwise coprime, which they are not necessarily.
for example, if \( d = p^e \), then solutions are \( k \equiv 0 \) or \( 1 \mod p^e \).
if \( d = p^e q^f \), then by chinese remainder theorem, number of solutions is 4.
but in general, if \( d \) has prime power factorization \( p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_m^{e_m} \), then the number of solutions to \( k(k - 1) \equiv 0 \mod d \) is \( 2^m \), but this is only if each modulus \( p_i^{e_i} \) allows two solutions, and they can be combined.
however, if the prime powers are not pairwise coprime, which they would be as parts of the factorization, actually, since \( d \) is a product of distinct primes, wait, no.
if \( d \) is divisible by \( p^2 \), then solving \( k(k - 1) \equiv 0 \mod p^2 \) has solutions \( k \equiv 0 \mod p^2 \) or \( k \equiv 1 \mod p^2 \), but if \( d \) is square-free, then each prime factor contributes a factor of 2.
but even so, the total number is \( 2^m \), where \( m \) is the number of distinct prime factors of \( d \).
wait, maybe not.
let me check with an example.
take \( d = 6 = 2 \times 3 \).
then solving \( k(k - 1) \equiv 0 \mod 6 \).
by the chinese remainder theorem, this is equivalent to solving \( k(k - 1) \equiv 0 \mod 2 \) and \( k(k - 1) \equiv 0 \mod 3 \).
for mod 2: either \( k \equiv 0 \mod 2 \) or \( k \equiv 1 \mod 2 \).
wait, but \( k(k - 1) \equiv 0 \mod 2 \) is always true because either \( k \) or \( k - 1 \) is even.
similarly, \( k(k - 1) \equiv 0 \mod 3 \) is equivalent to \( k \equiv 0 \mod 3 \) or \( 1 \mod 3 \).
therefore, mod 3, solutions are \( k \equiv 0, 1 \mod 3 \), and mod 2, solutions are all \( k \), since product of two consecutive numbers is always even.
so, combining with crt, the solutions mod 6 would be \( k \equiv 0, 1, 3, 4 \mod 6 \).
so four solutions, which is \( 2 \times 2 = 2^2 \), since two prime factors.
but if \( d \) has prime factors \( p, q \), then number of solutions is 4.
wait, but if \( d = pq \) with p and q distinct odd primes, then \( k(k - 1) \equiv 0 \mod pq \) is equivalent to \( k(k - 1) \equiv 0 \mod p \) and \( k(k - 1) \equiv 0 \mod q \).
each equation mod p and q has two solutions, so total solutions mod pq is 4 by crt.
therefore, for square-free d with m distinct prime factors, the number of solutions to \( k(k - 1) \equiv 0 \mod d \) is \( 2^m \).
however, in the case where d is a prime power, say \( d = p^e \), the number of solutions is 2: \( k \equiv 0 \) or \( 1 \mod p^e \).
therefore, if d is a prime power, there are two solutions.
if d is a product of m distinct primes, there are \( 2^m \) solutions.
but this might not hold if primes are repeated, but d is square-free here.
wait, but in the example with d=6, which is square-free with two primes, we have 4 solutions.
so perhaps the number of solutions is indeed \( 2^m \), where m is the number of distinct prime factors.
however, in the case where d is divisible by a higher power, say d=4, then?
for d=4: \( k(k - 1) \equiv 0 \mod 4 \).
since k and k-1 are coprime, so either k ≡ 0 mod 4 or k ≡ 1 mod 4.
because if k ≡ 0 mod 4, then k ≡ 0 mod 4.
if k ≡1 mod 4, then k-1 ≡0 mod 4.
but since 4 is a prime power, the solutions are k ≡0 or 1 mod 4, so two solutions.
similarly, if d=9, a prime power, solutions k ≡0 or 1 mod 9.
therefore, prime power d: 2 solutions.
square-free d with m prime factors: 2^m solutions.
wait, but in the case where d is 12=4*3.
then, d=12=4*3.
then, solving \( k(k - 1) ≡0 mod 12 \) is equivalent to solving \( k(k - 1) ≡0 mod 4 \) and \( k(k - 1) ≡0 mod 3 \).
for mod 4: k ≡0 or 1 mod 4.
for mod 3: k ≡0 or 1 mod 3.
combining these with crt.
each combination gives a solution mod 12.
so 2*2=4 solutions.
but let's check:
for mod 4: k ≡0,1; for mod 3: k≡0,1.
thus, possible combinations:
1. k ≡0 mod 4 and 0 mod 3: k ≡0 mod 12
2. k ≡0 mod 4 and 1 mod 3: chinese remainder theorem. solve 0 mod 4 and 1 mod 3.
let’s see: numbers 0,4,8 mod 12: check 0 mod 3 is 0; 4 mod 3 =1; 8 mod 3=2.
so 4 is 1 mod 3.
so k≡4 mod 12.
3. k≡1 mod4 and 0 mod3: solve k≡1 mod4 and 0 mod3.
check numbers 0,3,6,9 mod12.
3 mod4=3, 6 mod4=2, 9 mod4=1.
so 9 mod4=1, so k≡9 mod12.
4. k≡1 mod4 and 1 mod3: k≡1 mod12.
so solutions are k≡0,1,4,9 mod12.
therefore, 4 solutions.
thus, even though 12 is not square-free (it has a square factor 4), the number of solutions is 4, which is 2^2, since it has two distinct prime factors.
so perhaps the formula is indeed \( 2^m \), where m is the number of distinct prime factors, even if d is not square-free.
but only the number of distinct primes, not the exponents.
wait, but let's check d=18=2*3^2.
then d=18, prime factors are 2 and 3.
so number of solutions should be 2^2=4?
let's check:
solve \( k(k - 1) ≡0 mod 18 \).
this requires that 2 | k(k -1) and 9 |k(k -1).
since 2 and 9 are coprime.
for mod 2: as before, always true.
for mod 9: k ≡0 or 1 mod9.
therefore, combining with mod2, which is automatic, the solutions mod18 would be k≡0,1 mod9, same as mod 9?
wait, no.
wait, mod9 solutions are k≡0,1 mod9.
then, since mod2 is already satisfied (as k(k-1) is even), we can take k≡0,1 mod9, and then translate to mod18.
for k≡0 mod9: k=0,9 mod18.
for k≡1 mod9: k=1,10 mod18.
so solutions mod18 are 0,1,9,10.
therefore, four solutions.
thus, 2^2=4, which is the number of distinct prime factors (2 and 3).
so even with higher powers, like 9 here, the number is still 4.
so the number of solutions is indeed \( 2^m \), where m is the number of distinct prime factors of d.
so, for a general d, if d has m distinct prime factors, then the number of solutions to \( k(k - 1) ≡0 \mod d \) is \( 2^m \).
wait, but hold on, in the case d=4, m=1 (only prime factor 2), and solutions are 2, which fits \( 2^1 \).
for d=6, m=2 (prime factors 2,3), solutions 4, which is \( 2^2 \).
for d=12, m=2 (prime factors 2,3), solutions 4.
for d=18, same.
for d=30=2*3*5, m=3, then solutions would be 8.
let me check d=30.
then solving \( k(k - 1) ≡0 \mod 30 \).
this requires k(k -1) ≡0 mod2, 3, and 5.
mod2: automatic.
mod3: k≡0 or1 mod3.
mod5: k≡0 or1 mod5.
so by crt, number of solutions is 2 (mod3) * 2 (mod5) = 4 mod15, but combined with mod2, but k can be 0 or1 mod2 as well, but since the product is always even, does that add more solutions?
wait, no.
the chinese remainder theorem would combine mod3, mod2, mod5.
wait, maybe i need to compute it properly.
d=30.
solutions to k(k -1) ≡0 mod30 are those k where:
- k ≡0 or1 mod3
- k ≡0 or1 mod5
- k is arbitrary mod2, because k(k -1) is always even.
therefore, mod2 gives no restriction, as the product is always even.
so the solutions are determined by their residues mod3 and mod5.
each combination of residues:
for mod3: 0 or1 (2 choices)
for mod5: 0 or1 (2 choices)
so total solutions mod15 (since mod3 and mod5) are 2*2=4.
then, since mod2 is independent and can be 0 or1, does that double the number?
wait, no.
because mod2 is already factored into the product.
wait, actually, mod30, since 30=2*3*5.
so solving the congruences for mod2, mod3, mod5.
for mod3 and mod5, as before, 0 or1.
for mod2, no restriction, since product is even.
wait, but k(k -1) ≡0 mod2 is always true, so in fact, the solutions are those k where:
- mod3: k≡0 or1
- mod5: k≡0 or1
- mod2: any
therefore, the number of solutions mod30 would be 2 (mod3 choices) * 2 (mod5 choices) * 1 (mod2, already enforced by k(k-1) being even).
wait, but let's use crt properly.
each choice of residues mod3 and mod5 (0 or1) can be combined with any residue mod2.
but since k(k -1) must be divisible by 30=2*3*5, and since k and k-1 are consecutive integers, one is even.
so for mod2, it's automatically satisfied.
therefore, for mod3 and mod5, each has two choices, leading to 4 combinations.
each combination can be lifted to mod30 using crt.
therefore, the number of solutions is 4.
wait, but 4 solutions would be:
1. k ≡0 mod3, 0 mod5 ⇒ k≡0 mod15 ⇒ k≡0 or15 mod30
2. k≡0 mod3, 1 mod5 ⇒ solve k≡0 mod3, k≡1 mod5.
for example, k=21 mod15 ⇒ 21 mod30?
wait, let me solve k≡0 mod3 and k≡1 mod5.
let k=5m +1.
then 5m +1 ≡0 mod3 ⇒5m≡-1 mod3⇒ 2m≡2 mod3⇒m≡1 mod3.
so m=3t +1.
thus, k=5(3t +1) +1=15t +6.
so k≡6 mod15 ⇒k≡6 or21 mod30.
3. k≡1 mod3, 0 mod5 ⇒ solve k≡1 mod3 and k≡0 mod5.
let k=3m +1.
then 3m +1≡0 mod5 ⇒3m≡-1 mod5⇒3m≡4 mod5⇒ m≡ 3^{-1}*4 mod5.
3*2=6≡1 mod5, so inverse is 2.
thus, m≡ 2*4=8≡3 mod5.
so m=5t +3.
thus, k=3*(5t +3)+1=15t +10.
so k≡10 mod15 ⇒k≡10 or25 mod30.
4. k≡1 mod3, 1 mod5 ⇒k≡1 mod15 ⇒k≡1 or16 mod30.
but wait, these are four solutions:
1. k≡0,15 mod30
2. k≡6,21 mod30
3. k≡10,25 mod30
4. k≡1,16 mod30
but each of these are two residues, so total 8 residues?
wait, no.
for each of the four combinations mod15, each gives two residues mod30:
0 mod15: 0,15
6 mod15:6,21
10 mod15:10,25
1 mod15:1,16
so total 8 solutions mod30.
but d=30, so k from 1 to30, giving 8 solutions.
therefore, the number of solutions is 8=2^3?
but d=30 has three distinct prime factors (2,3,5), so m=3, and 2^3=8.
wait, so the formula is actually \( 2^m \), where m is the number of distinct prime factors of d, even if one of them is 2?
but in the case of d=30, the prime factors are 2,3,5, so three primes, but since for modulus 2, the equation is always true, you might think it doesn't contribute, but in reality, when applying crt across all primes, even with the factor 2, the number of solutions is \( 2^m \), where m is the number of distinct prime factors.
wait, but in the case of d=6 (primes 2,3), number of solutions is 4=2^2, as before.
for d=30 (primes 2,3,5), solutions=8=2^3.
wait, but in d=30, even with three prime factors, you get 8 solutions.
so, perhaps the formula is indeed \( 2^m \), where m is the number of distinct prime factors, including 2, but applied correctly.
wait, but in the case where d=15=3*5 (two primes), the number of solutions is 4=2^2, which includes mod2 automatically.
wait, but d=15, then k(k -1) ≡0 mod15.
since 15=3*5.
then, k(k -1) ≡0 mod3 and 0 mod5.
so k ≡0 or1 mod3, and 0 or1 mod5.
by crt, 4 solutions mod15.
but 15 is 3*5, so m=2, giving 2^2=4.
if d=15, then in the range k=1 to15, how many solutions are there?
let's compute:
for mod3: 0 or1.
for mod5:0 or1.
so possible k:
1. 0 mod3 and0 mod5:15k, but 0 mod15 is 0.
but k=1 to15, so 0 mod15 is 0,15.
but 0 is not in 1-15, so 15.
but k=15:15(14)=210.
210 mod15=0.
so k=15 is a solution.
2. 0 mod3 and1 mod5: solve k≡0 mod3 and1 mod5.
let’s solve k≡1 mod5, 0 mod3.
let k=5m +1.
then 5m +1≡0 mod3 ⇒5m≡-1 mod3⇒5m≡2 mod3⇒2m≡2 mod3⇒m≡1 mod3.
so m=3t +1.
k=5(3t +1)+1=15t +6.
so k=6,21, etc.
but k up to15: 6.
3. 1 mod3 and0 mod5: k≡0 mod5 and1 mod3.
let k=5m.
then 5m≡1 mod3⇒5m≡1 mod3⇒2m≡1 mod3⇒m≡2 mod3.
so m=3t +2.
k=5*(3t +2)=15t +10.
so k=10.
4. 1 mod3 and1 mod5: k≡1 mod both3 and5: k≡1 mod15.
so k=1.
so solutions for d=15 (mod15) are k=1,6,10,15.
but k=1:1*0=0 mod15, yes.
k=6:6*5=30≡0 mod15.
k=10:10*9=90≡0 mod15.
k=15:15*14=210≡0 mod15.
so four solutions.
so 4 solutions, which is 2^2, m=2 primes (3,5).
but d=15, so this fits.
but in this case, even though 2 is not a
