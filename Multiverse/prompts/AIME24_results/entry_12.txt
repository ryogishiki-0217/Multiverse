Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid from the lower left corner to the upper right corner that change direction exactly four times.
The paths can only follow the lines, meaning they can only move right or up.
The examples shown have a path that goes right, then up, then right, up again, right again, and finally up.
That's changing direction four times, right?
Similarly, the other example goes up, right, up, right, up.
Also four direction changes.
So the key here is that the paths must have exactly four direction changes.
Hmm.
First, I need to recall how paths on a grid are counted.
For an 8x8 grid, moving from (0,0) to (8,8) requires 8 right moves and 8 up moves, so the total number of paths without any restrictions is C(16,8), which is 12870.
But this problem is different because it's restricting the number of direction changes to exactly four.
Let me think.
What is a direction change?
A direction change occurs when the path switches from moving right to moving up or from moving up to moving right.
So, in a path, if you have a sequence of right moves followed by a sequence of up moves, each transition between right and up counts as a direction change.
Let me check the first example given.
Starting at (0,0), moving right to (2,0), then up to (2,3), then right to (5,3), then up to (5,8), then finally right to (8,8).
Wait, actually, no.
Wait, from (5,3) to (5,8) is up, then from (5,8) to (8,8) is right?
So that would be another direction change.
Let me count again.
Starting at (0,0):
- Move right to (2,0) [no direction change yet]
- Then up to (2,3) [first direction change]
- Then right to (5,3) [second direction change]
- Then up to (5,8) [third direction change]
- Then right to (8,8) [fourth direction change]
So yes, four direction changes.
Similarly, the second example:
- Up to (0,3)
- Right to (3,3)
- Up to (3,5)
- Right to (8,5)
- Up to (8,8)
So direction changes at each switch: first up, then right (1), up (2), right (3), up (4).
So four direction changes again.
So the question is asking for all such paths that have exactly four direction changes.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>

<Outline>
1: Investigate the general structure of paths with exactly four direction changes.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: Analyze the first example path to determine its structure.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: How can I model this?
Each path can be represented as a sequence of right (R) and up (U) moves.
A direction change happens whenever an R is followed by a U or a U is followed by an R.
So, in terms of the sequence, a direction change occurs at every transition from R to U or U to R.
If we have exactly four direction changes, that means there are four such transitions in the entire sequence.
</Path>
<Path>
2: Wait, actually, let's take an example.
If a path goes right 5 times, then up 3 times, then right 2 times, up 4 times, and then right 1 time.
That would be multiple direction changes.
Wait, but how many?
Let's count.
Starting right, then up (change 1), then right (change 2), up (change 3), right (change 4).
So four direction changes.
Then it stops.
So the number of direction changes is equal to the number of times the path switches from right to up or up to right.
So if we model the path as alternating sequences of right and up moves, the number of direction changes is twice the number of blocks minus 1?
Maybe not.
Let's think differently.
Let's model the path as a sequence of moves.
Each move is either right (R) or up (U).
A direction change happens every time the move changes from R to U or from U to R.
So the problem reduces to counting the number of sequences of 8 R's and 8 U's with exactly four direction changes.
Wait, but in the examples, the direction changes are when the path goes from all horizontal to vertical.
But in terms of the sequence, each time you switch from R to U or U to R, that's a direction change.
So if you start with R, then a U is a direction change, then back to R is another direction change, etc.
So in that case, the total number of direction changes is equal to the number of times the direction switches.
So in a sequence like RRRUUURUUURRRU, each time the letter changes, that's a direction change.
So starting with R, the first U is change 1, then R change 2, then U change 3, then R change 4.
So that's four direction changes.
But wait, the path must start with either R or U and end when all moves are completed.
However, in the grid, the path starts at the lower left (0,0) and ends at the upper right (8,8), so the path must start with either R or U and end with the opposite direction probably.
Wait, but in the two examples given, the first one starts with R, then U, then R, then U, then R.
But it ends with R.
Because the upper right corner is (8,8); you can't go beyond.
So if you start at (0,0), to reach (8,8), you need to have exactly 8 R's and 8 U's.
So the sequence must start with either R or U and alternate directions, changing direction each time you switch from R to U or U to R.
The problem states that the direction changes exactly four times.
Wait, but in the first example, starting with R, the first direction change is at the first U, which is move 2.
Wait, maybe not.
Wait, direction changes in the path as shown in the grid would correspond to when the path moves from a horizontal segment to a vertical segment or vice versa.
So in the first example, the path goes right for two units, then up for three units, then right for three units, up for five units, then right for three units.
Wait, but 2+3+3+5+3=16?
Wait, starting at (0,0):
- Move right 2 to (2,0)
- Move up 3 to (2,3)
- Move right 3 to (5,3)
- Move up 5 to (5,8)
- Move right 3 to (8,8)
So total right moves: 2+3+3=8, total up moves:3+5=8.
So yes, 8 R's and 8 U's.
The direction changes happen when switching from right to up or up to right.
So in this case, the direction changes occur at the end of the first right segment (before moving up), end of first up segment (before moving right again), end of second right segment (before moving up again), end of third up segment (before moving right again).
Wait, but actually, direction changes in the path would correspond to the corners where the path turns.
So each time the path turns, that's a direction change.
In the first example, starting at (0,0) moving right: no turn.
At (2,0), direction changes to up: that's turn 1.
At (2,3), direction changes to right: turn 2.
At (5,3), direction changes to up: turn 3.
At (5,8), direction changes to right: turn 4.
And then proceeds straight to (8,8).
So four direction changes.
Similarly, in the second example, starting at (0,0) moving up: no turn.
At (0,3), direction changes to right: turn 1.
At (3,3), direction changes to up: turn 2.
At (3,5), direction changes to right: turn 3.
At (8,5), direction changes to up: turn 4.
Then proceeds to (8,8).
So four direction changes again.
So in general, for a path to have exactly four direction changes, the path must consist of horizontal and vertical segments alternating, starting and ending with a horizontal segment or starting and ending with a vertical segment?
Wait, in the first example, it starts with a horizontal segment and ends with a horizontal segment.
In the second example, it starts with a vertical segment and ends with a vertical segment.
But in both cases, there are four direction changes.
Let me check.
First example: starts right, changes to up, right, up, right.
So it starts with right, ends with right.
Second example: starts up, changes to right, up, right, up.
Starts with up, ends with up.
So in both cases, the path starts and ends with the same direction.
So if a path has an even number of direction changes, starting and ending with the same direction.
Because each direction change flips the direction.
If you start with R, first direction change is to U, second to R, third to U, fourth to R.
So four direction changes later, you end with R.
Similarly, if you start with U, four direction changes would bring you back to U.
So in order to have four direction changes, the path must start and end with the same direction.
But in the grid, the path starts at (0,0) and ends at (8,8).
Since (0,0) is the lower left and (8,8) is the upper right, the path must start with R or U and end with the opposite direction.
Wait, but in the examples, the first example starts with R and ends with R.
Wait, but (8,8) is the upper right corner.
So to finish at (8,8), if the path ends with R, moving right, but (8,8) is the rightmost and uppermost point; you can't move right or up anymore.
Wait, that seems conflicting.
Wait, perhaps the path is made of segments.
So in the first example, the last segment is from (5,8) to (8,8).
Since the current direction is right, starting at (5,8), moving right 3 units to (8,8).
So that's allowed.
Similarly, in the second example, the last segment is from (8,5) to (8,8), moving up.
So even though you can't move beyond (8,8), the segments end exactly at (8,8).
So the path is composed of alternating horizontal and vertical segments, each of length at least 1, such that the total right moves sum to 8 and the total up moves sum to 8.
The number of direction changes is equal to 2*(number of segments) - 2.
Wait, if you have a path with alternating horizontal and vertical segments, the number of direction changes is 2*(number of segments) - 2.
Wait, for example, if you have two segments: right then up.
That's one direction change.
If you have three segments: right, up, right.
That's two direction changes.
Wait, no, the formula might not hold.
Wait, if you have k segments, each segment is either horizontal or vertical, starting with one direction and alternating.
Then the number of direction changes is k - 1.
Because each new segment after the first one requires a direction change.
Wait, but if the segments are alternating directions, starting with right, then each new segment is a direction change.
So for example, 1 segment: right (no direction change).
2 segments: right, up (1 direction change).
3 segments: right, up, right (2 direction changes).
4 segments: right, up, right, up (3 direction changes).
Wait, no.
Wait, actually, each time you add a segment, you have to change direction.
So starting with right (1 segment, 0 direction changes).
Adding an up segment (2 segments, 1 direction change).
Adding a right segment (3 segments, 2 direction changes).
Adding an up segment (4 segments, 3 direction changes).
So in general, for k segments, you have k - 1 direction changes.
But in the problem statement, they want four direction changes.
So number of segments is 5, since 5 - 1 = 4.
Wait, but in the first example, how many segments are there?
Starting at (0,0):
- Right to (2,0): 1 segment
- Up to (2,3): 2 segments
- Right to (5,3): 3 segments
- Up to (5,8): 4 segments
- Right to (8,8): 5 segments
So five segments, which would result in four direction changes.
Similarly, the second example:
- Up to (0,3): 1 segment
- Right to (3,3): 2 segments
- Up to (3,5): 3 segments
- Right to (8,5): 4 segments
- Up to (8,8): 5 segments
So again five segments, four direction changes.
Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of paths with five segments, alternating between horizontal and vertical, starting with either horizontal or vertical, such that the total right moves sum to 8 and the total up moves also sum to 8.
So if the path starts with a horizontal segment, then it will have 5 segments: horizontal, vertical, horizontal, vertical, horizontal.
The lengths of the horizontal segments must sum to 8, and the vertical segments must also sum to 8.
Similarly, if it starts with a vertical segment, it will have vertical, horizontal, vertical, horizontal, vertical segments, again summing to 8 in each direction.
So in total, the number of such paths is twice the number of compositions of 8 into three parts (for the horizontal segments) multiplied by the number of compositions of 8 into two parts (for the vertical segments), or something like that?
Wait, let me think.
If the path starts with a horizontal segment, followed by vertical, etc., then for five segments, starting with horizontal, the number of direction changes is four.
So the path will have three horizontal segments and two vertical segments because it starts with horizontal and alternates.
Similarly, if it starts with vertical, it will have three vertical segments and two horizontal segments.
Wait, let me check.
Starting with horizontal:
Segment 1: Horizontal (R)
Segment 2: Vertical (U)
Segment 3: Horizontal (R)
Segment 4: Vertical (U)
Segment 5: Horizontal (R)
So indeed, three horizontal segments and two vertical segments.
Similarly, starting with vertical:
Segment 1: Vertical (U)
Segment 2: Horizontal (R)
Segment 3: Vertical (U)
Segment 4: Horizontal (R)
Segment 5: Vertical (U)
So three vertical segments and two horizontal segments.
Therefore, in the first case, the three horizontal segments must sum to 8, and the two vertical segments must sum to 8.
In the second case, the three vertical segments must sum to 8, and the two horizontal segments must sum to 8.
Therefore, the total number of paths is 2 * [number of compositions of 8 into three parts] * [number of compositions of 8 into two parts].
Wait, but compositions consider the order, which matters here because each segment's length is distinct in the path.
For example, composing 8 into three parts (a, b, c) where a + b + c = 8, each part at least 1.
Similarly, composing 8 into two parts (d, e) where d + e = 8, each part at least 1.
The number of compositions of 8 into three parts is C(7,2) = 21, since it's equivalent to placing two plus signs in the seven gaps between the ones: 1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1.
To make three parts, we need two dividers, so C(7,2)=21.
Similarly, compositions of 8 into two parts is C(7,1)=7.
Therefore, for each starting direction (horizontal or vertical), the number of paths is C(7,2)*C(7,1).
So total paths would be 2 * 21 * 7 = 294.
So is the answer 294?
But wait, let's verify with the example.
The first example has horizontal segments of length 2, 3, 3 and vertical segments of length 3, 5.
So the horizontal composition is 2+3+3=8, vertical composition 3+5=8.
The number of such paths would correspond to choosing where those segments occur.
But how does that relate to compositions?
Each composition corresponds to a way of splitting the total number of moves into segments.
For example, the horizontal moves are split into three segments, which can be any composition of 8 into three parts, and the vertical moves into two parts.
Then the number of paths is the number of orderings of these segments.
But perhaps it's more complicated because the segments have to alternate directions.
Wait, but since the direction alternates, the order of the segments is fixed.
Once you decide whether you start with horizontal or vertical, the rest of the segment directions are determined.
Therefore, for each starting direction, you just need to choose the lengths of the segments in the respective directions.
So for starting with horizontal, you choose three horizontal lengths (a, b, c) and two vertical lengths (d, e).
Each set must sum to 8.
The number of ways to choose the horizontal lengths is the number of compositions of 8 into three parts, which is C(7,2)=21, and the vertical lengths is C(7,1)=7.
So for each starting direction, the number is 21*7=147, so total 294.
Therefore, the answer is 294.
But let me check with another perspective.
Alternatively, think of the problem as a sequence of moves with exactly four direction changes.
Each direction change occurs when the direction switches.
So starting with R, the first direction change is when switching to U, then R, U, R.
So the path has five segments: R, U, R, U, R.
Each R segment must have length at least 1, as must each U segment.
So the number of such paths is equal to the number of ways to split the 8 R moves into three segments (each at least 1) and the 8 U moves into two segments (each at least 1).
Similarly, if starting with U, splitting 8 U moves into three segments and 8 R moves into two segments.
So for each case, the number is C(7,2)*C(7,1)=21*7=147.
So total 294.
Therefore, the answer should be 294.
But let me confirm with a smaller case.
Suppose the grid is smaller, say 2x2, and we want paths with two direction changes.
Let's see.
For a 2x2 grid, moving from (0,0) to (2,2).
The paths must have two direction changes, which would correspond to starting with R, then U, then R, or starting with U, then R, then U.
Each has two direction changes.
The number of such paths would be:
If starting with R: split 2 R's into two segments (since three segments total, but wait for 2x2 grid and two direction changes, the path would be R, U, R.
So horizontal, vertical, horizontal.
So the R moves are split into two segments (first R segment of length 1, last R segment of length 1), and the U moves into one segment of length 2.
But the compositions: R is split into two parts (with two parts needed for three segments?
Wait, maybe my previous logic is slightly flawed.
Wait, in the 2x2 case, starting with R, then U, then R.
So the R moves are split into two segments (1 and 1) and the U moves into one segment (2).
But since the grid is 2x2, the total R moves are 2 and U moves are 2.
So the number of compositions for R: if starting with horizontal, you have two R segments (since three segments total: H, V, H).
Wait, no.
Wait, in the path H, V, H, the horizontal segments are two moves: the first H moves some steps, then V, then H moves the remaining steps.
Similarly, vertical is moved in one segment.
So in the 2x2 case, the number of paths starting with H is the number of ways to split 2 R's into two segments (each at least 1) and the 2 U's into one segment.
The number of compositions of 2 into two parts is C(1,1)=1 (since 1+1 is the only composition).
Similarly, compositions of 2 into one part is just 1 (the part 2).
Therefore, the number of paths starting with H is 1*1=1, and same starting with V, so total 2.
But actually, in a 2x2 grid, the two paths with two direction changes are R, U, R and U, R, U.
Each has two direction changes.
So they are (R, U, R) and (U, R, U).
Each has exactly two direction changes.
So the formula in the small case gives 2, which is correct.
So applying the same logic, in the original problem, answer is 294.
Therefore, I think the answer is 294.
**Final Answer**
\boxed{294}

Answer: To solve the problem of finding the number of paths of length 16 on an 8x8 grid that change direction exactly four times, we need to consider the following:

1. **Direction Changes**: A direction change occurs when the path switches from moving right (R) to moving up (U) or vice versa. 
2. **<Path> Structure**: A path with exactly four direction changes must consist of five segments (alternating between R and U). This can start either with R or U. 
3. **Compositions**: 
   - If the path starts with R, it will have three horizontal segments (summing to 8 R moves) and two vertical segments (summing to 8 U moves).
   - If the path starts with U, it will have three vertical segments (summing to 8 U moves) and two horizontal segments (summing to 8 R moves).

The number of compositions of 8 into three parts (for the segments starting with R or U) is given by \(\binom{7}{2} = 21\). The number of compositions of 8 into two parts (for the other segments) is given by \(\binom{7}{1} = 7\).

Thus, the total number of paths is calculated as:
- For paths starting with R: \(21 \times 7 = 147\)
- For paths starting with U: \(21 \times 7 = 147\)

Adding these together gives the total number of paths:
\[ 147 + 147 = 294 \]

Therefore, the number of paths that change direction exactly four times is \(\boxed{294}\).<Conclusion>

okay, so i have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid from the lower left corner to the upper right corner that change direction exactly four times.

hmm.
first, i need to recall how paths on a grid are counted.
for an 8x8 grid, moving from (0,0) to (8,8) requires 8 right moves and 8 up moves, so the total number of paths without any restrictions is c(16,8), which is 12870.
but this problem is different because it's restricting the number of direction changes to exactly four.
let me think.
what is a direction change?
a direction change occurs when the path switches from moving right to moving up or from moving up to moving right.
so, in a path, if you have a sequence of right moves followed by a sequence of up moves, each transition between right and up counts as a direction change.
let me check the first example given.
starting at (0,0), moving right to (2,0), then up to (2,3), then right to (5,3), then up to (5,8), then finally right to (8,8).
wait, actually, no.
wait, from (5,3) to (5,8) is up, then from (5,8) to (8,8) is right?
so that would be another direction change.
let me count again.
starting at (0,0):
- move right to (2,0) [no direction change yet]
- then up to (2,3) [first direction change]
- then right to (5,3) [second direction change]
- then up to (5,8) [third direction change]
- then right to (8,8) [fourth direction change]
so yes, four direction changes.
similarly, the second example:
- up to (0,3)
- right to (3,3)
- up to (3,5)
- right to (8,5)
- up to (8,8)
so direction changes at each switch: first up, then right (1), up (2), right (3), up (4).
so four direction changes again.
so the question is asking for all such paths that have exactly four direction changes.
let's think in parallel.

so in a sequence like rrruuuruuurrru, each time the letter changes, that's a direction change.
so starting with r, the first u is change 1, then r change 2, then u change 3, then r change 4.
so that's four direction changes.
but wait, the path must start with either r or u and end when all moves are completed.
however, in the grid, the path starts at the lower left (0,0) and ends at the upper right (8,8), so the path must start with either r or u and end with the opposite direction probably.
wait, but in the two examples given, the first one starts with r, then u, then r, then u, then r.
but it ends with r.
because the upper right corner is (8,8); you can't go beyond.
so if you start at (0,0), to reach (8,8), you need to have exactly 8 r's and 8 u's.
so the sequence must start with either r or u and alternate directions, changing direction each time you switch from r to u or u to r.
the problem states that the direction changes exactly four times.
wait, but in the first example, starting with r, the first direction change is at the first u, which is move 2.
wait, maybe not.
wait, direction changes in the path as shown in the grid would correspond to when the path moves from a horizontal segment to a vertical segment or vice versa.
so in the first example, the path goes right for two units, then up for three units, then right for three units, up for five units, then right for three units.
wait, but 2+3+3+5+3=16?
wait, starting at (0,0):
- move right 2 to (2,0)
- move up 3 to (2,3)
- move right 3 to (5,3)
- move up 5 to (5,8)
- move right 3 to (8,8)
so total right moves: 2+3+3=8, total up moves:3+5=8.
so yes, 8 r's and 8 u's.
the direction changes happen when switching from right to up or up to right.
so in this case, the direction changes occur at the end of the first right segment (before moving up), end of first up segment (before moving right again), end of second right segment (before moving up again), end of third up segment (before moving right again).
wait, but actually, direction changes in the path would correspond to the corners where the path turns.
so each time the path turns, that's a direction change.
in the first example, starting at (0,0) moving right: no turn.
at (2,0), direction changes to up: that's turn 1.
at (2,3), direction changes to right: turn 2.
at (5,3), direction changes to up: turn 3.
at (5,8), direction changes to right: turn 4.
and then proceeds straight to (8,8).
so four direction changes.
similarly, in the second example, starting at (0,0) moving up: no turn.
at (0,3), direction changes to right: turn 1.
at (3,3), direction changes to up: turn 2.
at (3,5), direction changes to right: turn 3.
at (8,5), direction changes to up: turn 4.
then proceeds to (8,8).
so four direction changes again.
so in general, for a path to have exactly four direction changes, the path must consist of horizontal and vertical segments alternating, starting and ending with a horizontal segment or starting and ending with a vertical segment?
wait, in the first example, it starts with a horizontal segment and ends with a horizontal segment.
in the second example, it starts with a vertical segment and ends with a vertical segment.
but in both cases, there are four direction changes.
let me check.
first example: starts right, changes to up, right, up, right.
so it starts with right, ends with right.
second example: starts up, changes to right, up, right, up.
starts with up, ends with up.
so in both cases, the path starts and ends with the same direction.
so if a path has an even number of direction changes, starting and ending with the same direction.
because each direction change flips the direction.
if you start with r, first direction change is to u, second to r, third to u, fourth to r.
so four direction changes later, you end with r.
similarly, if you start with u, four direction changes would bring you back to u.
so in order to have four direction changes, the path must start and end with the same direction.
but in the grid, the path starts at (0,0) and ends at (8,8).
since (0,0) is the lower left and (8,8) is the upper right, the path must start with r or u and end with the opposite direction.
wait, but in the examples, the first example starts with r and ends with r.
wait, but (8,8) is the upper right corner.
so to finish at (8,8), if the path ends with r, moving right, but (8,8) is the rightmost and uppermost point; you can't move right or up anymore.
wait, that seems conflicting.
wait, perhaps the path is made of segments.
so in the first example, the last segment is from (5,8) to (8,8).
since the current direction is right, starting at (5,8), moving right 3 units to (8,8).
so that's allowed.
similarly, in the second example, the last segment is from (8,5) to (8,8), moving up.
so even though you can't move beyond (8,8), the segments end exactly at (8,8).
so the path is composed of alternating horizontal and vertical segments, each of length at least 1, such that the total right moves sum to 8 and the total up moves sum to 8.
the number of direction changes is equal to 2*(number of segments) - 2.
wait, if you have a path with alternating horizontal and vertical segments, the number of direction changes is 2*(number of segments) - 2.
wait, for example, if you have two segments: right then up.
that's one direction change.
if you have three segments: right, up, right.
that's two direction changes.
wait, no, the formula might not hold.
wait, if you have k segments, each segment is either horizontal or vertical, starting with one direction and alternating.
then the number of direction changes is k - 1.
because each new segment after the first one requires a direction change.
wait, but if the segments are alternating directions, starting with right, then each new segment is a direction change.
so for example, 1 segment: right (no direction change).
2 segments: right, up (1 direction change).
3 segments: right, up, right (2 direction changes).
4 segments: right, up, right, up (3 direction changes).
wait, no.
wait, actually, each time you add a segment, you have to change direction.
so starting with right (1 segment, 0 direction changes).
adding an up segment (2 segments, 1 direction change).
adding a right segment (3 segments, 2 direction changes).
adding an up segment (4 segments, 3 direction changes).
so in general, for k segments, you have k - 1 direction changes.
but in the problem statement, they want four direction changes.
so number of segments is 5, since 5 - 1 = 4.
wait, but in the first example, how many segments are there?
starting at (0,0):
- right to (2,0): 1 segment
- up to (2,3): 2 segments
- right to (5,3): 3 segments
- up to (5,8): 4 segments
- right to (8,8): 5 segments
so five segments, which would result in four direction changes.
similarly, the second example:
- up to (0,3): 1 segment
- right to (3,3): 2 segments
- up to (3,5): 3 segments
- right to (8,5): 4 segments
- up to (8,8): 5 segments
so again five segments, four direction changes.
therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of paths with five segments, alternating between horizontal and vertical, starting with either horizontal or vertical, such that the total right moves sum to 8 and the total up moves also sum to 8.
so if the path starts with a horizontal segment, then it will have 5 segments: horizontal, vertical, horizontal, vertical, horizontal.
the lengths of the horizontal segments must sum to 8, and the vertical segments must also sum to 8.
similarly, if it starts with a vertical segment, it will have vertical, horizontal, vertical, horizontal, vertical segments, again summing to 8 in each direction.
so in total, the number of such paths is twice the number of compositions of 8 into three parts (for the horizontal segments) multiplied by the number of compositions of 8 into two parts (for the vertical segments), or something like that?
wait, let me think.
if the path starts with a horizontal segment, followed by vertical, etc., then for five segments, starting with horizontal, the number of direction changes is four.
so the path will have three horizontal segments and two vertical segments because it starts with horizontal and alternates.
similarly, if it starts with vertical, it will have three vertical segments and two horizontal segments.
wait, let me check.
starting with horizontal:
segment 1: horizontal (r)
segment 2: vertical (u)
segment 3: horizontal (r)
segment 4: vertical (u)
segment 5: horizontal (r)
so indeed, three horizontal segments and two vertical segments.
similarly, starting with vertical:
segment 1: vertical (u)
segment 2: horizontal (r)
segment 3: vertical (u)
segment 4: horizontal (r)
segment 5: vertical (u)
so three vertical segments and two horizontal segments.
therefore, in the first case, the three horizontal segments must sum to 8, and the two vertical segments must sum to 8.
in the second case, the three vertical segments must sum to 8, and the two horizontal segments must sum to 8.
therefore, the total number of paths is 2 * [number of compositions of 8 into three parts] * [number of compositions of 8 into two parts].
wait, but compositions consider the order, which matters here because each segment's length is distinct in the path.
for example, composing 8 into three parts (a, b, c) where a + b + c = 8, each part at least 1.
similarly, composing 8 into two parts (d, e) where d + e = 8, each part at least 1.
the number of compositions of 8 into three parts is c(7,2) = 21, since it's equivalent to placing two plus signs in the seven gaps between the ones: 1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1.
to make three parts, we need two dividers, so c(7,2)=21.
similarly, compositions of 8 into two parts is c(7,1)=7.
therefore, for each starting direction (horizontal or vertical), the number of paths is c(7,2)*c(7,1).
so total paths would be 2 * 21 * 7 = 294.
so is the answer 294?
but wait, let's verify with the example.
the first example has horizontal segments of length 2, 3, 3 and vertical segments of length 3, 5.
so the horizontal composition is 2+3+3=8, vertical composition 3+5=8.
the number of such paths would correspond to choosing where those segments occur.
but how does that relate to compositions?
each composition corresponds to a way of splitting the total number of moves into segments.
for example, the horizontal moves are split into three segments, which can be any composition of 8 into three parts, and the vertical moves into two parts.
then the number of paths is the number of orderings of these segments.
but perhaps it's more complicated because the segments have to alternate directions.
wait, but since the direction alternates, the order of the segments is fixed.
once you decide whether you start with horizontal or vertical, the rest of the segment directions are determined.
therefore, for each starting direction, you just need to choose the lengths of the segments in the respective directions.
so for starting with horizontal, you choose three horizontal lengths (a, b, c) and two vertical lengths (d, e).
each set must sum to 8.
the number of ways to choose the horizontal lengths is the number of compositions of 8 into three parts, which is c(7,2)=21, and the vertical lengths is c(7,1)=7.
so for each starting direction, the number is 21*7=147, so total 294.
therefore, the answer is 294.
but let me check with another perspective.
alternatively, think of the problem as a sequence of moves with exactly four direction changes.
each direction change occurs when the direction switches.
so starting with r, the first direction change is when switching to u, then r, u, r.
so the path has five segments: r, u, r, u, r.
each r segment must have length at least 1, as must each u segment.
so the number of such paths is equal to the number of ways to split the 8 r moves into three segments (each at least 1) and the 8 u moves into two segments (each at least 1).
similarly, if starting with u, splitting 8 u moves into three segments and 8 r moves into two segments.
so for each case, the number is c(7,2)*c(7,1)=21*7=147.
so total 294.
therefore, the answer should be 294.
but let me confirm with a smaller case.
suppose the grid is smaller, say 2x2, and we want paths with two direction changes.
let's see.
for a 2x2 grid, moving from (0,0) to (2,2).
the paths must have two direction changes, which would correspond to starting with r, then u, then r, or starting with u, then r, then u.
each has two direction changes.
the number of such paths would be:
if starting with r: split 2 r's into two segments (since three segments total, but wait for 2x2 grid and two direction changes, the path would be r, u, r.
so horizontal, vertical, horizontal.
so the r moves are split into two segments (first r segment of length 1, last r segment of length 1), and the u moves into one segment of length 2.
but the compositions: r is split into two parts (with two parts needed for three segments?
wait, maybe my previous logic is slightly flawed.
wait, in the 2x2 case, starting with r, then u, then r.
so the r moves are split into two segments (1 and 1) and the u moves into one segment (2).
but since the grid is 2x2, the total r moves are 2 and u moves are 2.
so the number of compositions for r: if starting with horizontal, you have two r segments (since three segments total: h, v, h).
wait, no.
wait, in the path h, v, h, the horizontal segments are two moves: the first h moves some steps, then v, then h moves the remaining steps.
similarly, vertical is moved in one segment.
so in the 2x2 case, the number of paths starting with h is the number of ways to split 2 r's into two segments (each at least 1) and the 2 u's into one segment.
the number of compositions of 2 into two parts is c(1,1)=1 (since 1+1 is the only composition).
similarly, compositions of 2 into one part is just 1 (the part 2).
therefore, the number of paths starting with h is 1*1=1, and same starting with v, so total 2.
but actually, in a 2x2 grid, the two paths with two direction changes are r, u, r and u, r, u.
each has two direction changes.
so they are (r, u, r) and (u, r, u).
each has exactly two direction changes.
so the formula in the small case gives 2, which is correct.
so applying the same logic, in the original problem, answer is 294.
therefore, i think the answer is 294.
**final answer**
\boxed{294}

answer: to solve the problem of finding the number of paths of length 16 on an 8x8 grid that change direction exactly four times, we need to consider the following:

1. **direction changes**: a direction change occurs when the path switches from moving right (r) to moving up (u) or vice versa. 
2. **<path> structure**: a path with exactly four direction changes must consist of five segments (alternating between r and u). this can start either with r or u. 
3. **compositions**: 
   - if the path starts with r, it will have three horizontal segments (summing to 8 r moves) and two vertical segments (summing to 8 u moves).
   - if the path starts with u, it will have three vertical segments (summing to 8 u moves) and two horizontal segments (summing to 8 r moves).

the number of compositions of 8 into three parts (for the segments starting with r or u) is given by \(\binom{7}{2} = 21\). the number of compositions of 8 into two parts (for the other segments) is given by \(\binom{7}{1} = 7\).

thus, the total number of paths is calculated as:
- for paths starting with r: \(21 \times 7 = 147\)
- for paths starting with u: \(21 \times 7 = 147\)

adding these together gives the total number of paths:
\[ 147 + 147 = 294 \]

therefore, the number of paths that change direction exactly four times is \(\boxed{294}\).<conclusion>
