<Think>
Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this token game.
Alice goes first, and each turn, a player can take either 1 or 4 tokens.
The person who takes the last token wins.
We need to find how many positive integers n (up to 2024) exist where Bob has a winning strategy, no matter what Alice does.
Hmm.
Let's try to understand the game better.
Since Alice goes first, Bob's first move will be in response to Alice's move.
So, if Alice takes 1, Bob can take 1 or 4, and so on.
But the key here is to figure out positions where the player whose turn it is can force a win, regardless of the opponent's moves.
These are called winning and losing positions in game theory.
A winning position is when the player can force a win, and a losing position is when no matter what the player does, the opponent can respond in a way that forces a win.
So, if we can classify each n as either a winning or losing position, then the answer would be the count of losing positions for Alice (since Bob is the second player).
Wait, actually, since Alice goes first, if n is a losing position, that means no matter what Alice does, Bob can respond in a way to ensure he wins.
So, the answer is the number of n ≤ 2024 where n is a losing position.
So, we need to find all n ≤ 2024 where n is a losing position.
Therefore, first, we need to figure out the pattern or determine for each n whether it's a winning or losing position.
Let me start by working out small values of n to see if a pattern emerges.
Let's think in parallel.

<Path>
1: For n=1, the first player (Alice) takes the last token and wins, making n=1 a winning position.
</Path>
<Path>
2: For n=2, Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 token for Bob. Bob can then take this last token and win. Alternatively, if Alice were to take 4 tokens, she would exceed the available 2 tokens, which is not allowed. Therefore, Alice's only move is to take 1 token. This means Bob can take the remaining token and win, making n=2 a losing position for Alice.
</Path>
<Path>
3: For n=3, Alice can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. Removing 4 tokens is not possible since there are only 3. If Alice removes 1 token, 2 remain. Bob can then remove 1 or 4 tokens. Removing 4 is not possible. If Bob removes 1 token, 1 token remains. Alice can then take the last token and win. Therefore, for n=3, Alice can force a win by taking 1 token, making it a winning position.
</Path>
<Path>
4: For n=4, the first player can take all 4 tokens and win, making n=4 a winning position.
</Path>
<Path>
5: For n=5, Alice has two choices: taking 1 or 4 tokens. If she takes 1, 4 remain; if she takes 4, 1 remains. For n=4, Bob can take all 4 and win; for n=1, Bob can take 1 and win. Consequently, Bob can win regardless of Alice's choice, making n=5 a losing position (L).
</Path>
<Path>
6: For n=6, Alice can take 1 token, leaving 5, which is a winning position for Bob. Alternatively, Alice can take 4 tokens, leaving 2, which is also a winning position for Bob. Since all possible moves from n=6 lead to winning positions for Bob, n=6 is a losing position for Alice.
</Path>
<Path>
7: For n=7, Alice can choose to take 1 token, leaving 6. If Alice takes 1, Bob can take 1, leaving 5, which is a losing position for Alice. Alternatively, if Alice takes 4 from 7, she leaves 3, which is a winning position for Bob. If Bob takes 1 from 3, he leaves 2, a losing position for Alice. If Alice takes 1 from 2, she leaves 1, which is a winning position for Bob. Alternatively, if Bob takes 4 from 3, he cannot do so. Therefore, taking 4 is not a valid move for Bob from 3. If Alice takes 1 from 3, leaving 2, Bob can take 1, leaving 1, which is a win for Bob. If Alice takes 4 from 7, leaving 3, Bob can take 1, leaving 2, which is a losing position for Alice. If Alice takes 1 from 2, she leaves 1, which is a win for Bob. Alternatively, if Bob takes 1 from 3, leaving 2, which is a losing position for Alice. Therefore, for n=7, regardless of Alice's move, Bob can respond in a way that leads to a losing position for Alice. Thus, n=7 is a losing position.
</Path>
<Path>
8: For n=8, Alice's possible first moves are to take 1 token, leaving 7 (a winning position for Bob), or to take 4 tokens, leaving 4 (also a winning position for Bob). As all possible moves from n=8 lead to winning positions for Bob, n=8 is a losing position for Alice, designated as L.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The analysis of n from 1 to 8 reveals the following outcomes: n=1, 3, 4, 6, and 8 are losing positions for Alice (L), while n=2, 5, and 7 are winning positions for Alice (W).

Wait, wait.
Hold on, maybe I made a mistake here.
Let's verify again.
Let's think in parallel.

1: For n=5, Alice's options are to take 1 or 4 tokens. If she takes 1, 4 remain. From n=4, Bob can take all 4 tokens and win. If Alice takes 4, 1 remains, and Bob can take that 1 token to win. Therefore, regardless of Alice's move, Bob can win, making n=5 a losing position for Alice.
</Path>
<Path>
2: For n=6, Alice can take 1 token, leaving 5. This 5 is a losing position for Bob, meaning if Alice takes 1 from 6, Bob is left in a losing position. Alternatively, if Alice takes 4 tokens from 6, 2 tokens remain. This 2 is a losing position for Bob. Consequently, both possible moves from n=6 lead to losing positions for Bob, indicating that n=6 is a winning position for Alice.
</Path>
<Path>
3: For n=7, Alice can take 1 token, leaving 6 (a losing position for Bob). Alternatively, Alice can take 4 tokens, leaving 3 (a winning position for Bob). From the losing position of 6, Bob cannot force a win. From the winning position of 3, Bob can take 1 token, leaving 2 (a losing position for Alice). If Alice takes 1 token from 3, leaving 2, Bob can take 1 token, leaving 1 (a win for Bob). If Alice takes 4 from 3, she cannot do so. Thus, if Alice takes 4 from 7, leaving 3, Bob can take 1, leaving 2 (a losing position for Alice). If Alice takes 1 from 2, leaving 1, Bob wins. If Bob takes 1 from 3, leaving 2 (a losing position for Alice), Alice is forced into a losing position. Consequently, for n=7, regardless of Alice's move, Bob can respond to create a losing position for Alice. Therefore, n=7 is a losing position for Alice.
</Path>
<Path>
4: For n=8, Alice can take 1 token, leaving 7, which is a winning position for Bob. Alternatively, she can take 4 tokens, leaving 4, which is also a winning position for Bob. Therefore, all moves from n=8 lead to winning positions for Bob, making n=8 a losing position for Alice.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The detailed re-evaluation confirms that n=5 is a losing position (L) because both of Alice's moves lead to winning positions for Bob (n=4 and n=1). For n=6, both of Alice's moves lead to losing positions for Bob (n=5 and n=2), making n=6 a winning position for Alice (W). For n=7, both of Alice's moves lead to winning positions for Bob (n=6 and n=3), making n=7 a losing position for Alice (L). For n=8, both of Alice's moves lead to winning positions for Bob (n=7 and n=4), making n=8 a losing position for Alice (L). This re-evaluation corrects the initial misclassification of n=6 as a losing position and confirms the classification of n=7 as a losing position.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Wait, this seems to be an inconsistency.
Let me check n=5 again.
Wait, if n=5, Alice can take 1, leaving 4 (a winning position for Bob), or take 4, leaving 1 (a winning position for Bob).
So, no matter what Alice does, she leaves a winning position for Bob.
Therefore, n=5 is a losing position for Alice.
Similarly, n=6: Alice can take 1, leaving 5 (losing for Bob), or take 4, leaving 2 (losing for Bob).
Wait, but if Alice takes 1 from 6, leaving 5, which is a losing position for Bob?
Wait, no, 5 is a losing position for Alice, which would mean that if Alice leaves 5 for Bob, then Bob is facing a losing position, so Alice can force a win.
Wait, maybe this is where the confusion is.
Wait, when we say 5 is a losing position, that means the player whose turn it is to move from 5 can't force a win.
So, if Alice moves from 6, taking 1 token leaves 5 for Bob.
Since 5 is a losing position, that means Bob cannot win from 5, so Alice can force a win by moving to 5.
Similarly, if Alice takes 4 from 6, leaving 2 for Bob.
Since 2 is a losing position, then Alice can also move to 2 by taking 4.
Wait, but both 5 and 2 are losing positions.
So, if Alice is at 6, she can choose to take 1 (leaving 5) or take 4 (leaving 2), both of which are losing positions for Bob.
Therefore, 6 would be a winning position for Alice.
So, n=6 is W.
Then, n=7: Alice can take 1, leaving 6 (W for Bob), or take 4, leaving 3 (W for Bob).
Wait, 6 is W and 3 is W.
Wait, but how?
If Alice is at 7 and she takes 1, leaving 6 for Bob.
If 6 is a winning position, then Bob can win from there, so that's good for Bob.
If Alice takes 4 from 7, leaving 3, which is also a winning position for Bob.
Therefore, all moves from 7 lead to winning positions for Bob, so n=7 is a losing position for Alice.
Similarly, n=8: Alice can take 1, leaving 7 (L), which is losing for Bob.
Wait, but 7 is a losing position, so if Alice takes 1 from 8, she leaves 7 for Bob, who is in a losing position.
Therefore, that would make n=8 a winning position for Alice.
Wait, but earlier I thought n=8 was a losing position.
Wait, this is a contradiction.
So, let me re-examine.
Let's build a table for n=1 to n=10 and see the positions step by step.
We need to define each position as either Winning (W) or Losing (L).
A position is W if there is a move to an L position.
A position is L if all moves lead to W positions.

<Path>
3: For n=3, the possible moves are to take 1 token, leaving 2 (an L position), or to take 4 tokens, which is invalid. Taking 1 token leads to an L position. Consequently, n=3 is a Winning (W) position.

6: For n=6, Alice can take 1 token, leaving 5 (a losing position for Bob), or take 4 tokens, leaving 2 (also a losing position for Bob). Both possible moves from n=6 lead to losing positions for Bob, meaning Alice can force a win from n=6, classifying it as a winning position (W).

10: For n=10, Alice can take 1 token, leaving 9 (L), or take 4 tokens, leaving 6 (W). Leaving 9 is a winning move for Alice, as 9 is a losing position for Bob. Thus, n=10 is a winning position for Alice (W).
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The analysis of n from 1 to 10 results in the following outcomes: n=1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 are winning positions (W), and n=2, 6, 10 are losing positions (L).
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Wait, hold on, this is confusing.
Let me clarify.
Let me define L positions as those where the current player cannot force a win, and W positions as those where the current player can force a win.
So:
- n=1: W (take 1)
- n=2: If you take 1, leaves 1 (W), so opponent can win.
Therefore, n=2: L
- n=3: Take 1, leaves 2 (L), so opponent can't win.
Therefore, n=3: W
- n=4: Take 4, win.
Therefore, W
- n=5: Take 1, leaves 4 (W), or take 4, leaves 1 (W).
Since both leaves W, n=5: L
- n=6: Take 1, leaves 5 (L) or take 4, leaves 2 (L).
Since both leaves L, meaning from n=6, you can force a win?
Wait, no.
Wait, no.
If you are at n=6, and you take 1, leaving 5 (which is L), so Bob is in a losing position.
Therefore, Alice can win.
Similarly, if Alice takes 4 from 6, leaving 2 (L), Bob is also in a losing position.
Therefore, n=6 is W because you can move to L.
Wait, but according to previous reasoning, n=6 is L.
There's a contradiction here.
Wait, maybe my initial definition was wrong.
Let me restate:
A position is a losing position (L) if every move leads to a winning position (W).
A position is a winning position (W) if there's at least one move to an L position.
Wait, no, that's standard game theory.
So, in normal play convention, a position is losing if you can't make a move (i.e., you lose immediately), but in this game, you don't lose immediately; you win by taking the last token.
So perhaps this is correct.
Wait, for n=1, it's a winning position.
For n=2, if you have to move, you can take 1, leaving 1, which is a win for the opponent.
So n=2 is a losing position.
n=3: take 1, leaving 2 (L), so you can move to L, so n=3 is W.
n=4: take 4, win.
So W.
n=5: taking 1 leaves 4 (W), taking 4 leaves 1 (W).
Since both moves lead to W, which means no move leads to L, so n=5 is L.
n=6: taking 1 leaves 5 (L), taking 4 leaves 2 (L).
So all moves lead to L?
Wait, no.
Wait, when you take 1 from 6, you leave 5 (L) for the opponent.
So from n=6, if you move to L, then the opponent is in L, so he can't force a win.
Therefore, n=6 should be W.
Wait, this is conflicting with my previous conclusion.
Wait, maybe I have a mistake here.
Wait, standard game theory: a position is losing if all moves from it lead to winning positions.
A position is winning if at least one move leads to a losing position.
So, starting from n=6: if you can move to a losing position, then n=6 is winning.
What are the moves from n=6?
Take 1: n=5, which is L.
Take 4: n=2, which is L.
Therefore, from n=6, you can move to L positions.
Therefore, n=6 is W.
Therefore, n=6 is W.
Then n=7:
Taking 1: leaves 6 (W)
Taking 4: leaves 3 (W)
Therefore, all moves lead to W.
Therefore, n=7 is L.
Similarly, n=8:
Taking 1: leaves 7 (L) → so from n=8, you can take 1 and leave opponent in L → so n=8 is W.
Taking 4: leaves 4 (W)
Therefore, there's at least one move to L, so n=8 is W.
n=9:
Taking 1: leaves 8 (W)
Taking 4: leaves 5 (L)
Therefore, can move to L → n=9 is W.
n=10:
Taking 1: leaves 9 (W)
Taking 4: leaves 6 (W)
So all moves lead to W, so n=10 is L.
Wait, so the losing positions are n=2,5,7,10,...
Let's list them:
L positions: 2,5,7,10,...
Wait, let's check n=5,7,10, indeed.
So the pattern is increasing by 3, then 2, then 3, maybe?
5 to 7 is 2, 7 to 10 is 3.
Not a clear pattern.
Let me check up to n=15.
Continuing:
n=11:
Take 1: 10 (L)
Take 4: 7 (L)
So all moves lead to L → so n=11 is W?
Wait, but if you take 1 from 11, you leave 10 (L), so opponent is in L.
Therefore, n=11 is W.
Wait, but according to previous logic, if all moves lead to L, then it's a W.
Wait, no.
Wait, standard:
If from n, all moves lead to L → then n is L.
If from n, at least one move leads to L → then n is W.
So, for n=11:
Taking 1: 10 (L), so you can move to L → therefore n=11 is W.
Wait, that's a mistake?
Wait, no.
If from n, if you can move to an L, then n is W.
Only if all moves lead to W is n an L.
So, for n=11, since taking 1 leads to L (10 is L), then n=11 is W.
Then, n=12:
Take 1: 11 (W)
Take 4: 8 (W)
So all moves lead to W → therefore n=12 is L.
Ah, got it.
So, n=12 is L.
Then n=13:
Take 1: 12 (L) → so you can move to L, so n=13 is W.
n=14:
Take 1:13 (W)
Take 4:10 (L)
So can move to L → W.
n=15:
Take 1:14 (W)
Take 4:11 (W)
So all moves lead to W → L.
Therefore, the losing positions are n=2,5,7,10,12,15,...
Hmm.
So between 2,5 is 3; 5,7 is 2; 7,10 is 3; 10,12 is 2; 12,15 is 3.
So alternates between subtracting 3 and 2?
Wait, not sure.
But maybe there's a cycle of 5.
Let's see from n=2,5,7,10,12,15.
The differences are 3,2,3,2,3,...
So alternates between 3 and 2.
So starting from 2, add 3:5, add 2:7, add3:10, add2:12, add3:15, add2:17, etc.
So the losing positions are numbers starting at 2, then adding alternately 3 and 2.
But let's check:
L positions: 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,27,...
Let's check for n=15:
Yes, as above, n=15 is L.
Then n=16:
Take 1:15 (L) → so n=16 is W.
n=17: taking 1:16 (W), taking4:13 (W) → so all moves lead to W, so n=17 is L.
Yes, which matches the pattern.
So the losing positions start at 2, then alternate adding 3 and 2: 2 +3=5, +2=7, +3=10, +2=12, +3=15, +2=17, etc.
So general formula: starting at 2, then every number in the sequence 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,... up to 2024.
So we need to find how many numbers are in this sequence and are ≤2024.
So first, let's check whether this sequence is complete.
Let's list more terms:
Starting at 2.
Add 3:5.
Add 2:7.
Add3:10.
Add2:12.
Add3:15.
Add2:17.
Add3:20.
Add2:22.
Add3:25.
Add2:27.
...
So the sequence increases by 3, then 2, alternately.
So each pair of terms increases by 5.
For example, 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,... so from 2 to 7 is 5, 5 to10 is 5, 7 to12 is5, 10 to15 is5, etc.
So each two steps, it's incrementing by 5.
Therefore, the sequence can be considered as two separate arithmetic sequences with step 5, starting at 2 and 5.
Let's think in parallel.

1: The sequence of losing positions is observed to be 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20, 22, 25, 27, and so on. The pattern involves starting with 2, then adding 3 to get 5, adding 2 to get 7, adding 3 to get 10, adding 2 to get 12, adding 3 to get 15, adding 2 to get 17, adding 3 to get 20, adding 2 to get 22, adding 3 to get 25, adding 2 to get 27, and continuing this alternation of adding 3 and 2 indefinitely. This results in two interleaved arithmetic sequences: one starting at 2 and increasing by 5 each time (2, 7, 12, 17, 22, 27, ...), and another starting at 5 and increasing by 5 each time (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, ...).

The sequence of losing positions (L-positions) is confirmed to consist of two interleaved arithmetic sequences: the first starts at 2 with a common difference of 5, having the general term 2 + 5k, and the second starts at 5 with a common difference of 5, having the general term 5 + 5k, where k is a non-negative integer.

Therefore, combining both sequences: numbers congruent to 2 mod5 and 0 mod5?
Wait, 2,7,12,17,22,... are numbers congruent to 2 mod5.
5,10,15,20,25,... are numbers congruent to 0 mod5.
But in reality, the first sequence is 2,7,12,17,22,... which is 2 +5k, and the second is 5,10,15,20,25,... which is 5 +5k.
So together, they form numbers that are 0 or 2 mod5.
Wait, let's check:
7 mod5=2
10 mod5=0
12 mod5= 12-2*5=2
15 mod5=0
Yes.
So actually, the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod5.
Wait, that can't be, because for example, n=17: 17 mod5=2, which is fine.
n=7:7 mod5=2, yes.
n=5:5 mod5=0, yes.
n=2:2 mod5=2, yes.
n=10:10 mod5=0, yes.
n=12:12 mod5=2, yes.
n=15:0, yes.
So indeed, all losing positions are numbers that are 0 or 2 mod5.
Wait, is that true?
Let's check n=20.
20 mod5=0, so L position.
If Alice faces n=20, can she move to L?
Taking 1 from20 leaves19 (which is 4 mod5=4, so W).
Taking4 from20 leaves16 (16 mod5=1, which is W).
So both moves lead to W, so n=20 is L, which matches.
Similarly, n=2: L.
n=5:0 mod5, which is L.
n=7:2 mod5, L.
n=10:0 mod5, L.
n=12:2 mod5, L.
n=15:0 mod5, L.
n=17:2 mod5, L.
n=22:22 mod5=2, L.
Yes, so all losing positions are n≡0 or2 mod5.
Therefore, we can generalize that a position is losing if and only if n≡0 or2 mod5.
Let's check n=18: 18 mod5=3.
Is it a winning position?
Yes.
Because, for example, taking 1 gives 17 (L).
So n=18 is W.
n=19:19 mod5=4.
Taking1 leaves18 (W).
Taking4 leaves15 (L).
So can move to L, so n=19 is W.
n=21:21 mod5=1.
Take1 leaves20 (L).
So n=21 is W.
So seems like all n not≡0 or2 mod5 are winning positions.
Therefore, in order to find the number of n≤2024 where n is a losing position, i.e., n≡0 or2 mod5.
So we need to compute how many numbers ≤2024 are congruent to0 or2 modulo5.
Since 5 is the modulus, in the range from1 to2024, inclusive.
The total number of such n is equal to the number of integers from1 to2024 that are≡0 mod5 plus the number≡2 mod5.
These two sets are disjoint because 0≠2 mod5.
Therefore, total count is N0 + N2 where N0 is ⌊2024/5⌋ and N2 is ⌊(2024 -2)/5⌋ +1.
Wait, let me recall how to compute numbers of the form 5k and 5k+2 up to N.
The formula for numbers ≡a mod d up to N is ⌊(N - a)/d⌋ +1, provided a≤N.
So here, for a=0: it's ⌊2024/5⌋.
But since starting from0, but n must be ≥1.
Wait, for a=0, the numbers are5*1=5,10,...,5*⌊2024/5⌋.
So numbers≡0 mod5 in1..2024 are5,10,...,2020 (since2024÷5=404.8, so ⌊2024/5⌋=404, meaning the largest multiple of5 ≤2024 is5*404=2020).
Similarly, for numbers≡2 mod5, the first one is2, then7,12,..., up to the largest one≤2024.
To find the count, solve 5k +2 ≤2024 →5k ≤2022 →k≤2022/5=404.4.
So k_max=404, hence the last term is5*404 +2=2020 +2=2022.
So numbers≡2 mod5 are2,7,...,2022.
Therefore, the count is404 -0 +1=405?
Wait, wait, fromk=0 to k=404, that's 405 terms.
But 5*404 +2=2022 which is≤2024.
So yes.
So total numbers≡0 mod5: from k=1 tok=404: 404 numbers.
Numbers≡2 mod5: from k=0 tok=404: 405 numbers.
Wait, but 404+1=405.
But need to check if2024 >=5*404 +2=2022.
Yes.
So total N0=404, N2=405.
Therefore, total losing positions=404 +405=809.
Wait, but let's confirm:
Let's think in parallel.

1: The count of numbers congruent to 0 modulo 5 within the range 1 to 2024 is determined by finding the integer division of 2024 by 5, which yields 404. This indicates there are 404 multiples of 5 in this range.

2: Numbers congruent to 2 modulo 5 (2 mod 5) within the range 1 to 2024 are identified by the formula 5k + 2 ≤ 2024. This inequality simplifies to k ≤ 404.4, meaning the maximum integer value for k is 404. The corresponding numbers are 5*0 + 2 = 2 up to 5*404 + 2 = 2022. This sequence, starting at 2 with a common difference of 5, includes 404 - 0 + 1 = 405 terms.

Therefore, total is404+405=809.
Therefore, the answer is809.
But let's check with our previous list.
From1 to15, the losing positions are2,5,7,10,12,15.
Let's compute how many up to15:
Numbers≡0 mod5:5,10,15 (3 numbers)
Numbers≡2 mod5:2,7,12 (3 numbers)
Total=6.
Our formula: floor(15/5)=3, floor((15-2)/5)=2.6→2*5+2=12, count=2 -0 +1=3.
So total3+3=6.
Correct.
But in actual list, we have 2,5,7,10,12,15—six numbers.
So formula holds.
Therefore, applying the same formula to2024, the result is404+405=809.
Therefore, the answer is809.
Wait, but let's just double-check.
Take N=2024.
How many numbers≤2024 are≡0 mod5.
These are5,10,...,2020.
Since2024÷5=404.8, so floor(404.8)=404.
So there are404 multiples of5 between1 and2024.
How many numbers≡2 mod5.
These are2,7,12,..., up to the largest 5k +2 ≤2024.
Solving for k:5k +2 ≤2024⇒5k≤2022⇒k≤2022/5=404.4.
So k_max=404.
Therefore, the numbers are for k=0 to404:405 numbers.
Therefore, total404+405=809.
Correct.
Therefore, the final answer should be809.
Wait, but just to make sure, let's check n=2022, which is 5*404 +2=2022.
2022 is a losing position.
n=2023: if you take1, leaves2022 (L).
So n=2023 is a winning position.
n=2024: take1 leaves2023 (W); take4 leaves2020 (L).
So if from2024 you take4, leaving2020 (L), so n=2024 is a winning position.
But 2024≡4 mod5, so not in0 or2.
Correct.
So n=2024 is W.
Therefore, the count up to2024 is indeed809.
Therefore, the answer is809.
**Final Answer** 
\boxed{809}

Answer: To determine the number of positive integers \( n \leq 2024 \) for which Bob has a winning strategy, we need to identify the losing positions (i.e., positions where the current player cannot force a win). A losing position occurs when all possible moves lead to winning positions for the opponent.

We analyze the game by classifying each position \( n \) as either a winning (W) or losing (L) position. Through detailed reasoning and pattern recognition, we find that the losing positions are numbers congruent to \( 0 \) or \( 2 \mod 5 \). 

To verify this, we check small values of \( n \) and observe the pattern:
- Losing positions (L) occur at \( n = 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, \ldots \)
- These positions follow the pattern \( 0 \) or \( 2 \mod 5 \).

We then count the numbers \( \leq 2024 \) that are congruent to \( 0 \) or \( 2 \mod 5 \):
- Numbers \( \equiv 0 \mod 5 \): \( 5, 10, \ldots, 2020 \). There are \( \left\lfloor \frac{2024}{5} \right\rfloor = 404 \) such numbers.
- Numbers \( \equiv 2 \mod 5 \): \( 2, 7, 12, \ldots, 2022 \). There are \( \left\lfloor \frac{2022}{5} \right\rfloor + 1 = 405 \) such numbers.

Summing these counts, we find the total number of losing positions:
\[ 404 + 405 = 809 \]

Thus, the number of positive integers \( n \leq 2024 \) for which Bob has a winning strategy is \(\boxed{809}\).

solve the following math problem: alice and bob play the following game. a stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. the players take turns with alice going first. on each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. whoever removes the last token wins. find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for bob that guarantees that bob will win the game regardless of alice's play.

<think>
okay, so alice and bob are playing this token game.
alice goes first, and each turn, a player can take either 1 or 4 tokens.
the person who takes the last token wins.
we need to find how many positive integers n (up to 2024) exist where bob has a winning strategy, no matter what alice does.
hmm.
let's try to understand the game better.
since alice goes first, bob's first move will be in response to alice's move.
so, if alice takes 1, bob can take 1 or 4, and so on.
but the key here is to figure out positions where the player whose turn it is can force a win, regardless of the opponent's moves.
these are called winning and losing positions in game theory.
a winning position is when the player can force a win, and a losing position is when no matter what the player does, the opponent can respond in a way that forces a win.
so, if we can classify each n as either a winning or losing position, then the answer would be the count of losing positions for alice (since bob is the second player).
wait, actually, since alice goes first, if n is a losing position, that means no matter what alice does, bob can respond in a way to ensure he wins.
so, the answer is the number of n ≤ 2024 where n is a losing position.
so, we need to find all n ≤ 2024 where n is a losing position.
therefore, first, we need to figure out the pattern or determine for each n whether it's a winning or losing position.
let me start by working out small values of n to see if a pattern emerges.

1: for n=1, the first player (alice) takes the last token and wins, making n=1 a winning position.
</path>
<path>
2: for n=2, alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 token for bob. bob can then take this last token and win. alternatively, if alice were to take 4 tokens, she would exceed the available 2 tokens, which is not allowed. therefore, alice's only move is to take 1 token. this means bob can take the remaining token and win, making n=2 a losing position for alice.
</path>
<path>
3: for n=3, alice can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. removing 4 tokens is not possible since there are only 3. if alice removes 1 token, 2 remain. bob can then remove 1 or 4 tokens. removing 4 is not possible. if bob removes 1 token, 1 token remains. alice can then take the last token and win. therefore, for n=3, alice can force a win by taking 1 token, making it a winning position.
</path>
<path>
4: for n=4, the first player can take all 4 tokens and win, making n=4 a winning position.

5: for n=5, alice has two choices: taking 1 or 4 tokens. if she takes 1, 4 remain; if she takes 4, 1 remains. for n=4, bob can take all 4 and win; for n=1, bob can take 1 and win. consequently, bob can win regardless of alice's choice, making n=5 a losing position (l).
</path>
<path>
6: for n=6, alice can take 1 token, leaving 5, which is a winning position for bob. alternatively, alice can take 4 tokens, leaving 2, which is also a winning position for bob. since all possible moves from n=6 lead to winning positions for bob, n=6 is a losing position for alice.
</path>
<path>
7: for n=7, alice can choose to take 1 token, leaving 6. if alice takes 1, bob can take 1, leaving 5, which is a losing position for alice. alternatively, if alice takes 4 from 7, she leaves 3, which is a winning position for bob. if bob takes 1 from 3, he leaves 2, a losing position for alice. if alice takes 1 from 2, she leaves 1, which is a winning position for bob. alternatively, if bob takes 4 from 3, he cannot do so. therefore, taking 4 is not a valid move for bob from 3. if alice takes 1 from 3, leaving 2, bob can take 1, leaving 1, which is a win for bob. if alice takes 4 from 7, leaving 3, bob can take 1, leaving 2, which is a losing position for alice. if alice takes 1 from 2, she leaves 1, which is a win for bob. alternatively, if bob takes 1 from 3, leaving 2, which is a losing position for alice. therefore, for n=7, regardless of alice's move, bob can respond in a way that leads to a losing position for alice. thus, n=7 is a losing position.

<path>
8: for n=8, alice's possible first moves are to take 1 token, leaving 7 (a winning position for bob), or to take 4 tokens, leaving 4 (also a winning position for bob). as all possible moves from n=8 lead to winning positions for bob, n=8 is a losing position for alice, designated as l.

1: for n=5, alice's options are to take 1 or 4 tokens. if she takes 1, 4 remain. from n=4, bob can take all 4 tokens and win. if alice takes 4, 1 remains, and bob can take that 1 token to win. therefore, regardless of alice's move, bob can win, making n=5 a losing position for alice.
</path>

2: for n=6, alice can take 1 token, leaving 5. this 5 is a losing position for bob, meaning if alice takes 1 from 6, bob is left in a losing position. alternatively, if alice takes 4 tokens from 6, 2 tokens remain. this 2 is a losing position for bob. consequently, both possible moves from n=6 lead to losing positions for bob, indicating that n=6 is a winning position for alice.
</path>
<path>
3: for n=7, alice can take 1 token, leaving 6 (a losing position for bob). alternatively, alice can take 4 tokens, leaving 3 (a winning position for bob). from the losing position of 6, bob cannot force a win. from the winning position of 3, bob can take 1 token, leaving 2 (a losing position for alice). if alice takes 1 token from 3, leaving 2, bob can take 1 token, leaving 1 (a win for bob). if alice takes 4 from 3, she cannot do so. thus, if alice takes 4 from 7, leaving 3, bob can take 1, leaving 2 (a losing position for alice). if alice takes 1 from 2, leaving 1, bob wins. if bob takes 1 from 3, leaving 2 (a losing position for alice), alice is forced into a losing position. consequently, for n=7, regardless of alice's move, bob can respond to create a losing position for alice. therefore, n=7 is a losing position for alice.

the detailed re-evaluation confirms that n=5 is a losing position (l) because both of alice's moves lead to winning positions for bob (n=4 and n=1). for n=6, both of alice's moves lead to losing positions for bob (n=5 and n=2), making n=6 a winning position for alice (w). for n=7, both of alice's moves lead to winning positions for bob (n=6 and n=3), making n=7 a losing position for alice (l). for n=8, both of alice's moves lead to winning positions for bob (n=7 and n=4), making n=8 a losing position for alice (l). this re-evaluation corrects the initial misclassification of n=6 as a losing position and confirms the classification of n=7 as a losing position.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
wait, this seems to be an inconsistency.
let me check n=5 again.
wait, if n=5, alice can take 1, leaving 4 (a winning position for bob), or take 4, leaving 1 (a winning position for bob).
so, no matter what alice does, she leaves a winning position for bob.
therefore, n=5 is a losing position for alice.
similarly, n=6: alice can take 1, leaving 5 (losing for bob), or take 4, leaving 2 (losing for bob).
wait, but if alice takes 1 from 6, leaving 5, which is a losing position for bob?
wait, no, 5 is a losing position for alice, which would mean that if alice leaves 5 for bob, then bob is facing a losing position, so alice can force a win.
wait, maybe this is where the confusion is.
wait, when we say 5 is a losing position, that means the player whose turn it is to move from 5 can't force a win.
so, if alice moves from 6, taking 1 token leaves 5 for bob.
since 5 is a losing position, that means bob cannot win from 5, so alice can force a win by moving to 5.
similarly, if alice takes 4 from 6, leaving 2 for bob.
since 2 is a losing position, then alice can also move to 2 by taking 4.
wait, but both 5 and 2 are losing positions.
so, if alice is at 6, she can choose to take 1 (leaving 5) or take 4 (leaving 2), both of which are losing positions for bob.
therefore, 6 would be a winning position for alice.
so, n=6 is w.
then, n=7: alice can take 1, leaving 6 (w for bob), or take 4, leaving 3 (w for bob).
wait, 6 is w and 3 is w.
wait, but how?
if alice is at 7 and she takes 1, leaving 6 for bob.
if 6 is a winning position, then bob can win from there, so that's good for bob.
if alice takes 4 from 7, leaving 3, which is also a winning position for bob.
therefore, all moves from 7 lead to winning positions for bob, so n=7 is a losing position for alice.
similarly, n=8: alice can take 1, leaving 7 (l), which is losing for bob.
wait, but 7 is a losing position, so if alice takes 1 from 8, she leaves 7 for bob, who is in a losing position.
therefore, that would make n=8 a winning position for alice.
wait, but earlier i thought n=8 was a losing position.
wait, this is a contradiction.
so, let me re-examine.
let's build a table for n=1 to n=10 and see the positions step by step.
we need to define each position as either winning (w) or losing (l).
a position is w if there is a move to an l position.
a position is l if all moves lead to w positions.

</path>
<conclusion>
the analysis of n from 1 to 10 results in the following outcomes: n=1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 are winning positions (w), and n=2, 6, 10 are losing positions (l).
</conclusion>
</parallel>
wait, hold on, this is confusing.
let me clarify.
let me define l positions as those where the current player cannot force a win, and w positions as those where the current player can force a win.
so:
- n=1: w (take 1)
- n=2: if you take 1, leaves 1 (w), so opponent can win.
therefore, n=2: l
- n=3: take 1, leaves 2 (l), so opponent can't win.
therefore, n=3: w
- n=4: take 4, win.
therefore, w
- n=5: take 1, leaves 4 (w), or take 4, leaves 1 (w).
since both leaves w, n=5: l
- n=6: take 1, leaves 5 (l) or take 4, leaves 2 (l).
since both leaves l, meaning from n=6, you can force a win?
wait, no.
wait, no.
if you are at n=6, and you take 1, leaving 5 (which is l), so bob is in a losing position.
therefore, alice can win.
similarly, if alice takes 4 from 6, leaving 2 (l), bob is also in a losing position.
therefore, n=6 is w because you can move to l.
wait, but according to previous reasoning, n=6 is l.
there's a contradiction here.
wait, maybe my initial definition was wrong.
let me restate:
a position is a losing position (l) if every move leads to a winning position (w).
a position is a winning position (w) if there's at least one move to an l position.
wait, no, that's standard game theory.
so, in normal play convention, a position is losing if you can't make a move (i.e., you lose immediately), but in this game, you don't lose immediately; you win by taking the last token.
so perhaps this is correct.
wait, for n=1, it's a winning position.
for n=2, if you have to move, you can take 1, leaving 1, which is a win for the opponent.
so n=2 is a losing position.
n=3: take 1, leaving 2 (l), so you can move to l, so n=3 is w.
n=4: take 4, win.
so w.
n=5: taking 1 leaves 4 (w), taking 4 leaves 1 (w).
since both moves lead to w, which means no move leads to l, so n=5 is l.
n=6: taking 1 leaves 5 (l), taking 4 leaves 2 (l).
so all moves lead to l?
wait, no.
wait, when you take 1 from 6, you leave 5 (l) for the opponent.
so from n=6, if you move to l, then the opponent is in l, so he can't force a win.
therefore, n=6 should be w.
wait, this is conflicting with my previous conclusion.
wait, maybe i have a mistake here.
wait, standard game theory: a position is losing if all moves from it lead to winning positions.
a position is winning if at least one move leads to a losing position.
so, starting from n=6: if you can move to a losing position, then n=6 is winning.
what are the moves from n=6?
take 1: n=5, which is l.
take 4: n=2, which is l.
therefore, from n=6, you can move to l positions.
therefore, n=6 is w.
therefore, n=6 is w.
then n=7:
taking 1: leaves 6 (w)
taking 4: leaves 3 (w)
therefore, all moves lead to w.
therefore, n=7 is l.
similarly, n=8:
taking 1: leaves 7 (l) → so from n=8, you can take 1 and leave opponent in l → so n=8 is w.
taking 4: leaves 4 (w)
therefore, there's at least one move to l, so n=8 is w.
n=9:
taking 1: leaves 8 (w)
taking 4: leaves 5 (l)
therefore, can move to l → n=9 is w.
n=10:
taking 1: leaves 9 (w)
taking 4: leaves 6 (w)
so all moves lead to w, so n=10 is l.
wait, so the losing positions are n=2,5,7,10,...
let's list them:
l positions: 2,5,7,10,...
wait, let's check n=5,7,10, indeed.
so the pattern is increasing by 3, then 2, then 3, maybe?
5 to 7 is 2, 7 to 10 is 3.
not a clear pattern.
let me check up to n=15.
continuing:
n=11:
take 1: 10 (l)
take 4: 7 (l)
so all moves lead to l → so n=11 is w?
wait, but if you take 1 from 11, you leave 10 (l), so opponent is in l.
therefore, n=11 is w.
wait, but according to previous logic, if all moves lead to l, then it's a w.
wait, no.
wait, standard:
if from n, all moves lead to l → then n is l.
if from n, at least one move leads to l → then n is w.
so, for n=11:
taking 1: 10 (l), so you can move to l → therefore n=11 is w.
wait, that's a mistake?
wait, no.
if from n, if you can move to an l, then n is w.
only if all moves lead to w is n an l.
so, for n=11, since taking 1 leads to l (10 is l), then n=11 is w.
then, n=12:
take 1: 11 (w)
take 4: 8 (w)
so all moves lead to w → therefore n=12 is l.
ah, got it.
so, n=12 is l.
then n=13:
take 1: 12 (l) → so you can move to l, so n=13 is w.
n=14:
take 1:13 (w)
take 4:10 (l)
so can move to l → w.
n=15:
take 1:14 (w)
take 4:11 (w)
so all moves lead to w → l.
therefore, the losing positions are n=2,5,7,10,12,15,...
hmm.
so between 2,5 is 3; 5,7 is 2; 7,10 is 3; 10,12 is 2; 12,15 is 3.
so alternates between subtracting 3 and 2?
wait, not sure.
but maybe there's a cycle of 5.
let's see from n=2,5,7,10,12,15.
the differences are 3,2,3,2,3,...
so alternates between 3 and 2.
so starting from 2, add 3:5, add 2:7, add3:10, add2:12, add3:15, add2:17, etc.
so the losing positions are numbers starting at 2, then adding alternately 3 and 2.
but let's check:
l positions: 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,27,...
let's check for n=15:
yes, as above, n=15 is l.
then n=16:
take 1:15 (l) → so n=16 is w.
n=17: taking 1:16 (w), taking4:13 (w) → so all moves lead to w, so n=17 is l.
yes, which matches the pattern.
so the losing positions start at 2, then alternate adding 3 and 2: 2 +3=5, +2=7, +3=10, +2=12, +3=15, +2=17, etc.
so general formula: starting at 2, then every number in the sequence 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,... up to 2024.
so we need to find how many numbers are in this sequence and are ≤2024.
so first, let's check whether this sequence is complete.
let's list more terms:
starting at 2.
add 3:5.
add 2:7.
add3:10.
add2:12.
add3:15.
add2:17.
add3:20.
add2:22.
add3:25.
add2:27.
...
so the sequence increases by 3, then 2, alternately.
so each pair of terms increases by 5.
for example, 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,... so from 2 to 7 is 5, 5 to10 is 5, 7 to12 is5, 10 to15 is5, etc.
so each two steps, it's incrementing by 5.
therefore, the sequence can be considered as two separate arithmetic sequences with step 5, starting at 2 and 5.
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>
<goal>
<outline>
1: determine the structure of the l-position sequence, specifically if it is composed of two interleaved arithmetic sequences starting at 2 and 5.
</outline>
<outline>
2: determine the explicit formula for the first interleaved arithmetic sequence (starting at 2) and its general term.
</outline>
<outline>
3: determine the explicit formula for the second interleaved arithmetic sequence (starting at 5) and its general term.
</outline>
</goal>
<path>
1: the sequence of losing positions is observed to be 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20, 22, 25, 27, and so on. the pattern involves starting with 2, then adding 3 to get 5, adding 2 to get 7, adding 3 to get 10, adding 2 to get 12, adding 3 to get 15, adding 2 to get 17, adding 3 to get 20, adding 2 to get 22, adding 3 to get 25, adding 2 to get 27, and continuing this alternation of adding 3 and 2 indefinitely. this results in two interleaved arithmetic sequences: one starting at 2 and increasing by 5 each time (2, 7, 12, 17, 22, 27, ...), and another starting at 5 and increasing by 5 each time (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, ...).
</path>
<path>
2: the first interleaved arithmetic sequence starts at 2 and has a common difference of 5. its general term is given by 2 + 5k, where k is a non-negative integer.
</path>
<path>
3: the second interleaved arithmetic sequence starts at 5 and has a common difference of 5. its general term can be expressed as 5 + 5k, where k is a non-negative integer.
</path>
<conclusion>
the sequence of losing positions (l-positions) is confirmed to consist of two interleaved arithmetic sequences: the first starts at 2 with a common difference of 5, having the general term 2 + 5k, and the second starts at 5 with a common difference of 5, having the general term 5 + 5k, where k is a non-negative integer.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
therefore, combining both sequences: numbers congruent to 2 mod5 and 0 mod5?
wait, 2,7,12,17,22,... are numbers congruent to 2 mod5.
5,10,15,20,25,... are numbers congruent to 0 mod5.
but in reality, the first sequence is 2,7,12,17,22,... which is 2 +5k, and the second is 5,10,15,20,25,... which is 5 +5k.
so together, they form numbers that are 0 or 2 mod5.
wait, let's check:
7 mod5=2
10 mod5=0
12 mod5= 12-2*5=2
15 mod5=0
yes.
so actually, the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod5.
wait, that can't be, because for example, n=17: 17 mod5=2, which is fine.
n=7:7 mod5=2, yes.
n=5:5 mod5=0, yes.
n=2:2 mod5=2, yes.
n=10:10 mod5=0, yes.
n=12:12 mod5=2, yes.
n=15:0, yes.
so indeed, all losing positions are numbers that are 0 or 2 mod5.
wait, is that true?
let's check n=20.
20 mod5=0, so l position.
if alice faces n=20, can she move to l?
taking 1 from20 leaves19 (which is 4 mod5=4, so w).
taking4 from20 leaves16 (16 mod5=1, which is w).
so both moves lead to w, so n=20 is l, which matches.
similarly, n=2: l.
n=5:0 mod5, which is l.
n=7:2 mod5, l.
n=10:0 mod5, l.
n=12:2 mod5, l.
n=15:0 mod5, l.
n=17:2 mod5, l.
n=22:22 mod5=2, l.
yes, so all losing positions are n≡0 or2 mod5.
therefore, we can generalize that a position is losing if and only if n≡0 or2 mod5.
let's check n=18: 18 mod5=3.
is it a winning position?
yes.
because, for example, taking 1 gives 17 (l).
so n=18 is w.
n=19:19 mod5=4.
taking1 leaves18 (w).
taking4 leaves15 (l).
so can move to l, so n=19 is w.
n=21:21 mod5=1.
take1 leaves20 (l).
so n=21 is w.
so seems like all n not≡0 or2 mod5 are winning positions.
therefore, in order to find the number of n≤2024 where n is a losing position, i.e., n≡0 or2 mod5.
so we need to compute how many numbers ≤2024 are congruent to0 or2 modulo5.
since 5 is the modulus, in the range from1 to2024, inclusive.
the total number of such n is equal to the number of integers from1 to2024 that are≡0 mod5 plus the number≡2 mod5.
these two sets are disjoint because 0≠2 mod5.
therefore, total count is n0 + n2 where n0 is ⌊2024/5⌋ and n2 is ⌊(2024 -2)/5⌋ +1.
wait, let me recall how to compute numbers of the form 5k and 5k+2 up to n.
the formula for numbers ≡a mod d up to n is ⌊(n - a)/d⌋ +1, provided a≤n.
so here, for a=0: it's ⌊2024/5⌋.
but since starting from0, but n must be ≥1.
wait, for a=0, the numbers are5*1=5,10,...,5*⌊2024/5⌋.
so numbers≡0 mod5 in1..2024 are5,10,...,2020 (since2024÷5=404.8, so ⌊2024/5⌋=404, meaning the largest multiple of5 ≤2024 is5*404=2020).
similarly, for numbers≡2 mod5, the first one is2, then7,12,..., up to the largest one≤2024.
to find the count, solve 5k +2 ≤2024 →5k ≤2022 →k≤2022/5=404.4.
so k_max=404, hence the last term is5*404 +2=2020 +2=2022.
so numbers≡2 mod5 are2,7,...,2022.
therefore, the count is404 -0 +1=405?
wait, wait, fromk=0 to k=404, that's 405 terms.
but 5*404 +2=2022 which is≤2024.
so yes.
so total numbers≡0 mod5: from k=1 tok=404: 404 numbers.
numbers≡2 mod5: from k=0 tok=404: 405 numbers.
wait, but 404+1=405.
but need to check if2024 >=5*404 +2=2022.
yes.
so total n0=404, n2=405.
therefore, total losing positions=404 +405=809.
wait, but let's confirm:
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>
<goal>
<outline>
1: the count of numbers congruent to 0 modulo 5 (0 mod 5) within the range 1 to 2024.
</outline>
<outline>
2: the count of numbers congruent to 2 modulo 5 (2 mod 5) within the range 1 to 2024.
</outline>
</goal>
<path>
1: the count of numbers congruent to 0 modulo 5 within the range 1 to 2024 is determined by finding the integer division of 2024 by 5, which yields 404. this indicates there are 404 multiples of 5 in this range.
</path>
<path>
2: numbers congruent to 2 modulo 5 (2 mod 5) within the range 1 to 2024 are identified by the formula 5k + 2 ≤ 2024. this inequality simplifies to k ≤ 404.4, meaning the maximum integer value for k is 404. the corresponding numbers are 5*0 + 2 = 2 up to 5*404 + 2 = 2022. this sequence, starting at 2 with a common difference of 5, includes 404 - 0 + 1 = 405 terms.
</path>
<conclusion>
within the range of 1 to 2024, there are 404 numbers congruent to 0 modulo 5, and 405 numbers congruent to 2 modulo 5.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
therefore, total is404+405=809.
therefore, the answer is809.
but let's check with our previous list.
from1 to15, the losing positions are2,5,7,10,12,15.
let's compute how many up to15:
numbers≡0 mod5:5,10,15 (3 numbers)
numbers≡2 mod5:2,7,12 (3 numbers)
total=6.
our formula: floor(15/5)=3, floor((15-2)/5)=2.6→2*5+2=12, count=2 -0 +1=3.
so total3+3=6.
correct.
but in actual list, we have 2,5,7,10,12,15—six numbers.
so formula holds.
therefore, applying the same formula to2024, the result is404+405=809.
therefore, the answer is809.
wait, but let's just double-check.
take n=2024.
how many numbers≤2024 are≡0 mod5.
these are5,10,...,2020.
since2024÷5=404.8, so floor(404.8)=404.
so there are404 multiples of5 between1 and2024.
how many numbers≡2 mod5.
these are2,7,12,..., up to the largest 5k +2 ≤2024.
solving for k:5k +2 ≤2024⇒5k≤2022⇒k≤2022/5=404.4.
so k_max=404.
therefore, the numbers are for k=0 to404:405 numbers.
therefore, total404+405=809.
correct.
therefore, the final answer should be809.
wait, but just to make sure, let's check n=2022, which is 5*404 +2=2022.
2022 is a losing position.
n=2023: if you take1, leaves2022 (l).
so n=2023 is a winning position.
n=2024: take1 leaves2023 (w); take4 leaves2020 (l).
so if from2024 you take4, leaving2020 (l), so n=2024 is a winning position.
but 2024≡4 mod5, so not in0 or2.
correct.
so n=2024 is w.
therefore, the count up to2024 is indeed809.
therefore, the answer is809.
**final answer** 
\boxed{809}
</think>

answer: to determine the number of positive integers \( n \leq 2024 \) for which bob has a winning strategy, we need to identify the losing positions (i.e., positions where the current player cannot force a win). a losing position occurs when all possible moves lead to winning positions for the opponent.

we analyze the game by classifying each position \( n \) as either a winning (w) or losing (l) position. through detailed reasoning and pattern recognition, we find that the losing positions are numbers congruent to \( 0 \) or \( 2 \mod 5 \). 

to verify this, we check small values of \( n \) and observe the pattern:
- losing positions (l) occur at \( n = 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, \ldots \)
- these positions follow the pattern \( 0 \) or \( 2 \mod 5 \).

we then count the numbers \( \leq 2024 \) that are congruent to \( 0 \) or \( 2 \mod 5 \):
- numbers \( \equiv 0 \mod 5 \): \( 5, 10, \ldots, 2020 \). there are \( \left\lfloor \frac{2024}{5} \right\rfloor = 404 \) such numbers.
- numbers \( \equiv 2 \mod 5 \): \( 2, 7, 12, \ldots, 2022 \). there are \( \left\lfloor \frac{2022}{5} \right\rfloor + 1 = 405 \) such numbers.

summing these counts, we find the total number of losing positions:
\[ 404 + 405 = 809 \]

thus, the number of positive integers \( n \leq 2024 \) for which bob has a winning strategy is \(\boxed{809}\)
