Okay, so I have this system of logarithmic equations with variables x, y, z, all positive real numbers.
The goal is to find the value of |log2(x4y3z2)|, which is going to be a fraction m/n, and then find m + n where m and n are coprime.
First, let me write down the given equations:
1. log2(x / (yz)) = 1/2
2. log2(y / (xz)) = 1/3
3. log2(z / (xy)) = 1/4
I need to solve for x, y, z, right?
But actually, maybe I don't need to solve for x, y, z individually.
Maybe I can find the value of log2(x4y3z2) directly by combining these equations.
That might be more efficient.
Let me think.
Let's denote log2 x = a, log2 y = b, log2 z = c.
Then x = 2^a, y = 2^b, z = 2^c.
Maybe this substitution will help.
Let's try that.
Let's see.
First equation: log2(x / (yz)) = 1/2.
Let's rewrite x/(yz) as (2^a) / (2^b * 2^c) = 2^(a - b - c).
Therefore, log2(2^(a - b - c)) = a - b - c = 1/2.
Similarly, second equation: log2(y / (xz)) = 1/3.
So y/(xz) = 2^b / (2^a * 2^c) = 2^(b - a - c).
Then log2(2^(b - a - c)) = b - a - c = 1/3.
Third equation: log2(z / (xy)) = 1/4.
So z/(xy) = 2^c / (2^a * 2^b) = 2^(c - a - b).
Then log2(2^(c - a - b)) = c - a - b = 1/4.
So now we have a linear system in terms of a, b, c:
1. a - b - c = 1/2
2. -a + b - c = 1/3
3. -a - b + c = 1/4
Wait, let me check that substitution again.
Because in the second equation, y/(xz) = 2^(b - a - c), right?
So taking log base 2, it's (b - a - c) = 1/3.
Same for the third equation: c - a - b = 1/4.
So yes, the system is:
1. a - b - c = 1/2
2. -a + b - c = 1/3
3. -a - b + c = 1/4
Hmm. So three equations.
Let me write them down:
Equation (1): a - b - c = 1/2
Equation (2): -a + b - c = 1/3
Equation (3): -a - b + c = 1/4
I need to solve for a, b, c.
Let's see.
Maybe adding equations can eliminate variables.
Let's try adding equations (1) and (2) to eliminate a:
(1) + (2): (a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) = 1/2 + 1/3
Simplify: (a - a) + (-b + b) + (-c - c) = 1/2 + 1/3
Which gives -2c = 5/6 => c = -5/12
Okay, so c = -5/12.
Now let's add equations (2) and (3) to eliminate a:
(2) + (3): (-a + b - c) + (-a - b + c) = 1/3 + 1/4
Simplify: (-a - a) + (b - b) + (-c + c) = 7/12
So, -2a = 7/12 => a = -7/24
Wait, but let me check that calculation again.
Equation (2): -a + b - c = 1/3
Equation (3): -a - b + c = 1/4
Adding them together:
(-a + b - c) + (-a - b + c) = (1/3 + 1/4)
Left side: -2a + (b - b) + (-c + c) = -2a
Right side: 7/12
So -2a = 7/12 => a = -7/(12*2) = -7/24.
Yes, that's right.
So a = -7/24.
Similarly, let's take equations (1) and (3).
Wait, let's try adding equations (1) and (2) and (3) to see.
Wait, actually, maybe we can get another equation.
Let's add all three equations (1), (2), (3):
(a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) + (-a - b + c) = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4
Let's compute left side:
a - a - a + (-b + b - b) + (-c - c + c) = -a - b - c
Wait:
Wait, let's count each variable:
a: coefficient is 1 - 1 - 1 = -1
b: coefficients: -1 + 1 -1 = -1
c: coefficients: -1 -1 +1 = -1
So left side: -a - b - c = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 = 6/12 + 4/12 + 3/12 = 13/12
Therefore: -a - b - c = 13/12
But we already have equation (3): -a - b + c = 1/4
So this is interesting.
So from the sum of all equations, we have -a - b - c = 13/12.
But equation (3): -a - b + c = 1/4.
So let's subtract equation (3) from the sum:
[-a - b - c] - [-a - b + c] = 13/12 - 1/4
Simplify left side: -2c
Right side: 13/12 - 3/12 = 10/12 = 5/6
So -2c = 5/6 => c = -5/12, which matches what we had before.
So consistent.
So c = -5/12, a = -7/24.
Now, let's substitute a and c into equation (1) to find b.
Equation (1): a - b - c = 1/2
Plug in a = -7/24 and c = -5/12:
(-7/24) - b - (-5/12) = 1/2
Simplify: (-7/24) - b + 5/12 = 1/2
Convert 5/12 to 10/24:
-7/24 + 10/24 - b = 1/2
(3/24) - b = 1/2
Simplify 3/24 to 1/8:
1/8 - b = 1/2
Then, -b = 1/2 - 1/8 = 4/8 - 1/8 = 3/8
Hence, b = -3/8
So b = -3/8.
Therefore, we have:
a = -7/24, b = -3/8, c = -5/12
So log2 x = a = -7/24, so x = 2^(-7/24)
Similarly, y = 2^b = 2^(-3/8), z = 2^(-5/12)
But now, the problem asks for |log2(x4 y3 z2)|
Let's compute log2(x4 y3 z2):
First, let's expand it:
log2(x4 y3 z2) = 4 log2 x + 3 log2 y + 2 log2 z
Which is 4a + 3b + 2c
Substitute a = -7/24, b = -3/8, c = -5/12:
4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12)
Compute each term:
First term: 4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = (-7)/6
Second term: 3*(-3/8) = (-9)/8
Third term: 2*(-5/12) = (-10)/12 = (-5)/6
So overall:
-7/6 - 9/8 - 5/6
Combine terms:
-7/6 -5/6 = (-7 -5)/6 = -12/6 = -2
Then, -2 -9/8 = -2 - 1.125 = -3.125
Convert to fractions:
-2 is -16/8, so -16/8 -9/8 = -25/8
Thus, log2(x4 y3 z2) = -25/8
Take the absolute value: |-25/8| = 25/8
Therefore, the value is 25/8, where m = 25 and n = 8, which are coprime.
Hence, m + n = 33.
Wait, wait.
Let me verify that calculation step by step.
First, compute 4a + 3b + 2c:
a = -7/24, so 4a = 4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = -7/6 ≈ -1.1667
b = -3/8, so 3b = 3*(-3/8) = -9/8 = -1.125
c = -5/12, so 2c = 2*(-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6 ≈ -0.8333
Adding them up: -7/6 (which is -7/6 ≈ -1.1667) -9/8 (≈ -1.125) -5/6 (≈ -0.8333).
Adding -7/6 and -5/6 first: (-7 -5)/6 = -12/6 = -2.
Then, -2 + (-9/8) = -2 - 9/8 = Converting to eighths: -16/8 -9/8 = -25/8.
So yes, correct. So log2(x4y3z2) = -25/8, absolute value is 25/8.
25 and 8 are coprime, so m = 25, n = 8, m + n = 33.
So the answer is 33.
Wait, but just to make sure, let me check this.
Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to combine the equations instead of solving for each variable.
Let's see.
We have three equations:
1. a - b - c = 1/2
2. -a + b - c = 1/3
3. -a - b + c = 1/4
We need to compute 4a + 3b + 2c.
So maybe express 4a + 3b + 2c as a combination of equations (1), (2), (3).
Let me see.
Let’s denote equation 1 as Eq1, equation 2 as Eq2, equation 3 as Eq3.
Let me consider Eq1: a - b - c = 1/2
Similarly, Eq2: -a + b - c = 1/3
Eq3: -a - b + c = 1/4
Multiply Eq1 by 4: 4a -4b -4c = 2
Multiply Eq2 by 3: -3a +3b -3c = 1
Multiply Eq3 by 2: -2a -2b +2c = 0.5
Now, add them all together:
(4a -4b -4c) + (-3a +3b -3c) + (-2a -2b +2c) = 2 +1 +0.5
Compute left side:
4a -3a -2a + (-4b +3b -2b) + (-4c -3c +2c) = ( -1a ) + (-3b) + (-5c )
Wait, that gives:
(4a -3a -2a) = -1a
(-4b +3b -2b) = -3b
(-4c -3c +2c) = -5c
So left side: -a -3b -5c
Right side: 2 +1 +0.5 = 3.5 = 7/2
But this gives -a -3b -5c = 7/2
But we need 4a + 3b +2c.
Hmm, maybe this approach isn't directly helpful.
Let's try to find coefficients.
Let me set up the equations.
We need to solve for 4a +3b +2c.
Let's consider:
Let’s suppose that:
k1*(a - b - c) + k2*(-a + b - c) + k3*(-a - b + c) = 4a +3b +2c
Therefore, equate coefficients:
For a: k1 - k2 - k3 = 4
For b: -k1 +k2 -k3 = 3
For c: -k1 -k2 +k3 = 2
So now we need to solve for k1, k2, k3.
Let's write down these equations:
1. k1 - k2 - k3 = 4
2. -k1 +k2 -k3 = 3
3. -k1 -k2 +k3 = 2
Let me add equations 1 and 2:
(k1 - k2 - k3) + (-k1 +k2 -k3) = 4 + 3
Simplify: -2k3 = 7 => k3 = -7/2
Similarly, add equations 2 and 3:
(-k1 +k2 -k3) + (-k1 -k2 +k3) = 3 + 2
Simplify: -2k1 = 5 => k1 = -5/2
Then plug k1 = -5/2 into equation 1:
(-5/2) -k2 -k3 = 4
But k3 = -7/2, so:
-5/2 -k2 - (-7/2) = 4 => (-5/2 +7/2) -k2 = 4 => (2/2) -k2 = 4 => 1 -k2 = 4 => -k2 = 3 => k2 = -3
Therefore, k1 = -5/2, k2 = -3, k3 = -7/2
Therefore, 4a +3b +2c = (-5/2)*(a - b -c) + (-3)*(-a +b -c) + (-7/2)*(-a -b +c)
But then, substituting the values from the original equations:
(a - b - c) = 1/2
(-a + b - c) = 1/3
(-a - b + c) = 1/4
Therefore, 4a +3b +2c = (-5/2)*(1/2) + (-3)*(1/3) + (-7/2)*(1/4)
Compute each term:
First term: (-5/2)*(1/2) = -5/4
Second term: (-3)*(1/3) = -1
Third term: (-7/2)*(1/4) = -7/8
So total: -5/4 -1 -7/8
Convert to eighths:
-10/8 -8/8 -7/8 = (-25)/8
Same result as before.
Therefore, log2(x4y3z2) = -25/8, absolute value is 25/8.
Therefore, m = 25, n =8, so m +n =33.
Therefore, the answer is 33.
**Final Answer**
\boxed{33}

Answer: Given the system of logarithmic equations:

\[
\begin{align*}
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) &= \frac{1}{2}, \\
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) &= \frac{1}{3}, \\
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) &= \frac{1}{4},
\end{align*}
\]

we need to find the value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|\).

First, we convert the logarithmic equations into linear equations by setting \(a = \log_2 x\), \(b = \log_2 y\), and \(c = \log_2 z\). This gives us:

\[
\begin{align*}
a - b - c &= \frac{1}{2}, \\
-b + a - c &= \frac{1}{3}, \\
-a - b + c &= \frac{1}{4}.
\end{align*}
\]

We solve this system of equations. Adding the first and second equations, we eliminate \(a\) and find:

\[
-2c = \frac{5}{6} \implies c = -\frac{5}{12}.
\]

Adding the second and third equations, we eliminate \(a\) and find:

\[
-2a = \frac{7}{12} \implies a = -\frac{7}{24}.
\]

Adding all three equations, we find:

\[
-a - b - c = \frac{13}{12}.
\]

Using the third equation \(-a - b + c = \frac{1}{4}\), we subtract it from the sum to confirm \(c = -\frac{5}{12}\). Substituting \(a\) and \(c\) into the first equation, we solve for \(b\):

\[
-\frac{7}{24} - b + \frac{5}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \implies b = -\frac{3}{8}.
\]

Thus, we have \(a = -\frac{7}{24}\), \(b = -\frac{3}{8}\), and \(c = -\frac{5}{12}\).

Next, we compute \(\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\):

\[
4a + 3b + 2c = 4\left(-\frac{7}{24}\right) + 3\left(-\frac{3}{8}\right) + 2\left(-\frac{5}{12}\right).
\]

Calculating each term:

\[
\begin{align*}
4 \left(-\frac{7}{24}\right) &= -\frac{7}{6}, \\
3 \left(-\frac{3}{8}\right) &= -\frac{9}{8}, \\
2 \left(-\frac{5}{12}\right) &= -\frac{5}{6}.
\end{align*}
\]

Summing these results:

\[
-\frac{7}{6} - \frac{9}{8} - \frac{5}{6} = -\frac{12}{6} - \frac{9}{8} = -2 - \frac{9}{8} = -\frac{25}{8}.
\]

Taking the absolute value, we get \(\left| -\frac{25}{8} \right| = \frac{25}{8}\). Therefore, \(m = 25\) and \(n = 8\), leading to \(m + n = 33\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{33}\).

let's denote log2 x = a, log2 y = b, log2 z = c.
then x = 2^a, y = 2^b, z = 2^c.
maybe this substitution will help.
let's try that.
let's see.
first equation: log2(x / (yz)) = 1/2.
let's rewrite x/(yz) as (2^a) / (2^b * 2^c) = 2^(a - b - c).
therefore, log2(2^(a - b - c)) = a - b - c = 1/2.
similarly, second equation: log2(y / (xz)) = 1/3.
so y/(xz) = 2^b / (2^a * 2^c) = 2^(b - a - c).
then log2(2^(b - a - c)) = b - a - c = 1/3.
third equation: log2(z / (xy)) = 1/4.
so z/(xy) = 2^c / (2^a * 2^b) = 2^(c - a - b).
then log2(2^(c - a - b)) = c - a - b = 1/4.
so now we have a linear system in terms of a, b, c:
1. a - b - c = 1/2
2. -a + b - c = 1/3
3. -a - b + c = 1/4
wait, let me check that substitution again.
because in the second equation, y/(xz) = 2^(b - a - c), right?
so taking log base 2, it's (b - a - c) = 1/3.
same for the third equation: c - a - b = 1/4.
so yes, the system is:
1. a - b - c = 1/2
2. -a + b - c = 1/3
3. -a - b + c = 1/4
hmm. so three equations.
let me write them down:
equation (1): a - b - c = 1/2
equation (2): -a + b - c = 1/3
equation (3): -a - b + c = 1/4
i need to solve for a, b, c.
let's see.
maybe adding equations can eliminate variables.
let's try adding equations (1) and (2) to eliminate a:
(1) + (2): (a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) = 1/2 + 1/3
simplify: (a - a) + (-b + b) + (-c - c) = 1/2 + 1/3
which gives -2c = 5/6 => c = -5/12
okay, so c = -5/12.
now let's add equations (2) and (3) to eliminate a:
(2) + (3): (-a + b - c) + (-a - b + c) = 1/3 + 1/4
simplify: (-a - a) + (b - b) + (-c + c) = 7/12
so, -2a = 7/12 => a = -7/24
wait, but let me check that calculation again.
equation (2): -a + b - c = 1/3
equation (3): -a - b + c = 1/4
adding them together:
(-a + b - c) + (-a - b + c) = (1/3 + 1/4)
left side: -2a + (b - b) + (-c + c) = -2a
right side: 7/12
so -2a = 7/12 => a = -7/(12*2) = -7/24.
yes, that's right.
so a = -7/24.
similarly, let's take equations (1) and (3).
wait, let's try adding equations (1) and (2) and (3) to see.
wait, actually, maybe we can get another equation.
let's add all three equations (1), (2), (3):
(a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) + (-a - b + c) = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4
let's compute left side:
a - a - a + (-b + b - b) + (-c - c + c) = -a - b - c
wait:
wait, let's count each variable:
a: coefficient is 1 - 1 - 1 = -1
b: coefficients: -1 + 1 -1 = -1
c: coefficients: -1 -1 +1 = -1
so left side: -a - b - c = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 = 6/12 + 4/12 + 3/12 = 13/12
therefore: -a - b - c = 13/12
but we already have equation (3): -a - b + c = 1/4
so this is interesting.
so from the sum of all equations, we have -a - b - c = 13/12.
but equation (3): -a - b + c = 1/4.
so let's subtract equation (3) from the sum:
[-a - b - c] - [-a - b + c] = 13/12 - 1/4
simplify left side: -2c
right side: 13/12 - 3/12 = 10/12 = 5/6
so -2c = 5/6 => c = -5/12, which matches what we had before.
so consistent.
so c = -5/12, a = -7/24.
now, let's substitute a and c into equation (1) to find b.
equation (1): a - b - c = 1/2
plug in a = -7/24 and c = -5/12:
(-7/24) - b - (-5/12) = 1/2
simplify: (-7/24) - b + 5/12 = 1/2
convert 5/12 to 10/24:
-7/24 + 10/24 - b = 1/2
(3/24) - b = 1/2
simplify 3/24 to 1/8:
1/8 - b = 1/2
then, -b = 1/2 - 1/8 = 4/8 - 1/8 = 3/8
hence, b = -3/8
so b = -3/8.
therefore, we have:
a = -7/24, b = -3/8, c = -5/12
so log2 x = a = -7/24, so x = 2^(-7/24)
similarly, y = 2^b = 2^(-3/8), z = 2^(-5/12)
but now, the problem asks for |log2(x4 y3 z2)|
let's compute log2(x4 y3 z2):
first, let's expand it:
log2(x4 y3 z2) = 4 log2 x + 3 log2 y + 2 log2 z
which is 4a + 3b + 2c
substitute a = -7/24, b = -3/8, c = -5/12:
4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12)
compute each term:
first term: 4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = (-7)/6
second term: 3*(-3/8) = (-9)/8
third term: 2*(-5/12) = (-10)/12 = (-5)/6
so overall:
-7/6 - 9/8 - 5/6
combine terms:
-7/6 -5/6 = (-7 -5)/6 = -12/6 = -2
then, -2 -9/8 = -2 - 1.125 = -3.125
convert to fractions:
-2 is -16/8, so -16/8 -9/8 = -25/8
thus, log2(x4 y3 z2) = -25/8
take the absolute value: |-25/8| = 25/8
therefore, the value is 25/8, where m = 25 and n = 8, which are coprime.
hence, m + n = 33.
wait, wait.
let me verify that calculation step by step.
first, compute 4a + 3b + 2c:
a = -7/24, so 4a = 4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = -7/6 ≈ -1.1667
b = -3/8, so 3b = 3*(-3/8) = -9/8 = -1.125
c = -5/12, so 2c = 2*(-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6 ≈ -0.8333
adding them up: -7/6 (which is -7/6 ≈ -1.1667) -9/8 (≈ -1.125) -5/6 (≈ -0.8333).
adding -7/6 and -5/6 first: (-7 -5)/6 = -12/6 = -2.
then, -2 + (-9/8) = -2 - 9/8 = converting to eighths: -16/8 -9/8 = -25/8.
so yes, correct. so log2(x4y3z2) = -25/8, absolute value is 25/8.
25 and 8 are coprime, so m = 25, n = 8, m + n = 33.
so the answer is 33.
wait, but just to make sure, let me check this.
alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to combine the equations instead of solving for each variable.
let's see.
we have three equations:
1. a - b - c = 1/2
2. -a + b - c = 1/3
3. -a - b + c = 1/4
we need to compute 4a + 3b + 2c.
so maybe express 4a + 3b + 2c as a combination of equations (1), (2), (3).
let me see.
let’s denote equation 1 as eq1, equation 2 as eq2, equation 3 as eq3.
let me consider eq1: a - b - c = 1/2
similarly, eq2: -a + b - c = 1/3
eq3: -a - b + c = 1/4
multiply eq1 by 4: 4a -4b -4c = 2
multiply eq2 by 3: -3a +3b -3c = 1
multiply eq3 by 2: -2a -2b +2c = 0.5
now, add them all together:
(4a -4b -4c) + (-3a +3b -3c) + (-2a -2b +2c) = 2 +1 +0.5
compute left side:
4a -3a -2a + (-4b +3b -2b) + (-4c -3c +2c) = ( -1a ) + (-3b) + (-5c )
wait, that gives:
(4a -3a -2a) = -1a
(-4b +3b -2b) = -3b
(-4c -3c +2c) = -5c
so left side: -a -3b -5c
right side: 2 +1 +0.5 = 3.5 = 7/2
but this gives -a -3b -5c = 7/2
but we need 4a + 3b +2c.
hmm, maybe this approach isn't directly helpful.
let's try to find coefficients.
let me set up the equations.
we need to solve for 4a +3b +2c.
let's consider:
let’s suppose that:
k1*(a - b - c) + k2*(-a + b - c) + k3*(-a - b + c) = 4a +3b +2c
therefore, equate coefficients:
for a: k1 - k2 - k3 = 4
for b: -k1 +k2 -k3 = 3
for c: -k1 -k2 +k3 = 2
so now we need to solve for k1, k2, k3.
let's write down these equations:
1. k1 - k2 - k3 = 4
2. -k1 +k2 -k3 = 3
3. -k1 -k2 +k3 = 2
let me add equations 1 and 2:
(k1 - k2 - k3) + (-k1 +k2 -k3) = 4 + 3
simplify: -2k3 = 7 => k3 = -7/2
similarly, add equations 2 and 3:
(-k1 +k2 -k3) + (-k1 -k2 +k3) = 3 + 2
simplify: -2k1 = 5 => k1 = -5/2
then plug k1 = -5/2 into equation 1:
(-5/2) -k2 -k3 = 4
but k3 = -7/2, so:
-5/2 -k2 - (-7/2) = 4 => (-5/2 +7/2) -k2 = 4 => (2/2) -k2 = 4 => 1 -k2 = 4 => -k2 = 3 => k2 = -3
therefore, k1 = -5/2, k2 = -3, k3 = -7/2
therefore, 4a +3b +2c = (-5/2)*(a - b -c) + (-3)*(-a +b -c) + (-7/2)*(-a -b +c)
but then, substituting the values from the original equations:
(a - b - c) = 1/2
(-a + b - c) = 1/3
(-a - b + c) = 1/4
therefore, 4a +3b +2c = (-5/2)*(1/2) + (-3)*(1/3) + (-7/2)*(1/4)
compute each term:
first term: (-5/2)*(1/2) = -5/4
second term: (-3)*(1/3) = -1
third term: (-7/2)*(1/4) = -7/8
so total: -5/4 -1 -7/8
convert to eighths:
-10/8 -8/8 -7/8 = (-25)/8
same result as before.
therefore, log2(x4y3z2) = -25/8, absolute value is 25/8.
therefore, m = 25, n =8, so m +n =33.
therefore, the answer is 33.
**final answer**
\boxed{33}

answer: given the system of logarithmic equations:

\[
\begin{align*}
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) &= \frac{1}{2}, \\
\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) &= \frac{1}{3}, \\
\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) &= \frac{1}{4},
\end{align*}
\]

we need to find the value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|\).

first, we convert the logarithmic equations into linear equations by setting \(a = \log_2 x\), \(b = \log_2 y\), and \(c = \log_2 z\). this gives us:

\[
\begin{align*}
a - b - c &= \frac{1}{2}, \\
-b + a - c &= \frac{1}{3}, \\
-a - b + c &= \frac{1}{4}.
\end{align*}
\]

we solve this system of equations. adding the first and second equations, we eliminate \(a\) and find:

\[
-2c = \frac{5}{6} \implies c = -\frac{5}{12}.
\]

adding the second and third equations, we eliminate \(a\) and find:

\[
-2a = \frac{7}{12} \implies a = -\frac{7}{24}.
\]

adding all three equations, we find:

\[
-a - b - c = \frac{13}{12}.
\]

using the third equation \(-a - b + c = \frac{1}{4}\), we subtract it from the sum to confirm \(c = -\frac{5}{12}\). substituting \(a\) and \(c\) into the first equation, we solve for \(b\):

\[
-\frac{7}{24} - b + \frac{5}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \implies b = -\frac{3}{8}.
\]

thus, we have \(a = -\frac{7}{24}\), \(b = -\frac{3}{8}\), and \(c = -\frac{5}{12}\).

next, we compute \(\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\):

\[
4a + 3b + 2c = 4\left(-\frac{7}{24}\right) + 3\left(-\frac{3}{8}\right) + 2\left(-\frac{5}{12}\right).
\]

calculating each term:

\[
\begin{align*}
4 \left(-\frac{7}{24}\right) &= -\frac{7}{6}, \\
3 \left(-\frac{3}{8}\right) &= -\frac{9}{8}, \\
2 \left(-\frac{5}{12}\right) &= -\frac{5}{6}.
\end{align*}
\]

summing these results:

\[
-\frac{7}{6} - \frac{9}{8} - \frac{5}{6} = -\frac{12}{6} - \frac{9}{8} = -2 - \frac{9}{8} = -\frac{25}{8}.
\]

taking the absolute value, we get \(\left| -\frac{25}{8} \right| = \frac{25}{8}\). therefore, \(m = 25\) and \(n = 8\), leading to \(m + n = 33\).

the final answer is \(\boxed{33}\)
