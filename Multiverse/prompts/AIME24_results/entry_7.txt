Okay, so I need to solve this problem where we have a set of rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and volume 23. We need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes. Then, find r2 which can be written as p/q where p and q are coprime, and then find p+q. Alright, let's start breaking this down.
First, let me recall that a rectangular box has a surface area given by 2(ab + bc + ca), where a, b, c are the lengths of the sides. The volume is abc. Here, they tell us that the surface area is 54 and the volume is 23. So, we have:
2(ab + bc + ca) = 54 => ab + bc + ca = 27
abc = 23
We need to find the smallest sphere (i.e., the minimal radius r) that can contain any rectangular box satisfying the above. The radius squared is requested, as p/q.
Hmm. So, the sphere has to contain the entire box. The smallest sphere that can contain a rectangular box is the one whose diameter is the space diagonal of the box. Wait, is that right?
Let me think. For a rectangular box, the sphere that contains it must have a radius at least as large as half the length of the space diagonal of the box. Because the space diagonal is the longest distance between any two vertices of the box. So, if the sphere has a radius equal to half the space diagonal, then the box would fit perfectly inside the sphere, with the center of the sphere at the center of the box.
Therefore, the radius r of the smallest sphere containing the box is (1/2)*sqrt(a2 + b2 + c2). So, if we can find the minimal value of sqrt(a2 + b2 + c2)/2 over all boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23, then square that to get r2.
Wait, but the problem says "the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of B". So, we need a sphere that can contain all such boxes, right? But maybe I misread. Wait, actually, the problem says "the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of B". So, each box in B must fit inside this sphere. So, we need the minimal r such that for every box in B, the space diagonal of the box is at most 2r. Therefore, r is half the maximum space diagonal among all boxes in B. Wait, no. Wait, actually, if all boxes must fit into the same sphere, then the sphere must be large enough to contain all of them. But since the boxes can be oriented in different ways, but wait, in this problem, since it's about containing the boxes, which are fixed in their orientation as rectangular boxes, so the sphere needs to contain all the points of the box when placed, say, with edges aligned with coordinate axes. But in that case, the space diagonal is the diameter, so the radius would be half the space diagonal.
Therefore, if all boxes in B must fit into the same sphere, then the required radius is the maximum over all boxes in B of (half the space diagonal). So, we need to find the maximum value of sqrt(a2 + b2 + c2)/2 for boxes in B, and that will be r. Then, r2 is the maximum (a2 + b2 + c2)/4, so we need to find the maximum a2 + b2 + c2 given the constraints 2(ab + bc + ca) = 54 (surface area) and abc = 23.
Wait, but that seems counterintuitive. If we need the smallest sphere that can contain each of the boxes, then if the boxes vary, the sphere must be large enough to contain the largest possible space diagonal among all such boxes. So, we need to maximize the space diagonal (i.e., sqrt(a2 + b2 + c2)) given the constraints, then divide by 2 to get r, then compute r2. Therefore, the problem reduces to: maximize d = sqrt(a2 + b2 + c2) subject to ab + bc + ca = 27 and abc = 23. Then, r2 = (d^2)/4.
So, we need to express this optimization problem. Let's think in parallel.

1: The objective is to maximize the sum of squares of the side lengths, a^2 + b^2 + c^2, given the constraints ab + bc + ca = 27 and abc = 23. A potential approach is to fix two variables and solve for the third, though this could be complex. The AM-QM inequality, which relates the arithmetic mean to the quadratic mean, might be applicable. The AM-QM inequality states that the arithmetic mean of a set of non-negative numbers is less than or equal to their quadratic mean. For the side lengths a, b, and c, the arithmetic mean is (a+b+c)/3 and the quadratic mean is sqrt((a^2 + b^2 + c^2)/3). The inequality (a+b+c)/3 ≤ sqrt((a^2 + b^2 + c^2)/3) implies that a^2 + b^2 + c^2 is minimized when a, b, and c are equal, which corresponds to a cube. However, a cube with volume 23 would have side length 23^(1/3), which is approximately 2.843866, and its surface area would be 6*(2.843866)^2) ≈ 48. This calculated surface area of approximately 48 is less than the given surface area of 54. Therefore, the given box cannot be a cube. This suggests that the maximum value of a^2 + b^2 + c^2 is sought, rather than the minimum, and that the maximum occurs when the variables are not all equal.
The problem requires finding the maximum value of a^2 + b^2 + c^2 under the constraints ab + bc + ca = 27 and abc = 23.
A Lagrangian multiplier method can be employed for optimization with multiple constraints.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The possibility of the maximum occurring at a corner point is explored. A corner point is characterized by one side length approaching zero. If one side length approaches zero, the product of the other two sides must approach the constant volume of 23. The surface area constraint then becomes the sum of the products of these two large sides and the approaching zero side, which also approaches zero. This contradicts the given surface area of 27, meaning the maximum cannot occur at such a corner point.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The maximum of a^2 + b^2 + c^2 does not occur at a critical point within the constraints (as a cube is not possible) nor at a corner point where a side length approaches zero.

Let me consider three variables a, b, c with constraints ab + bc + ca = 27 and abc = 23. We need to maximize a2 + b2 + c2.
Alternatively, perhaps use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Let’s set up the Lagrangian.
Let’s denote the function to maximize as f(a, b, c) = a2 + b2 + c2. The constraints are g(a, b, c) = ab + bc + ca - 27 = 0 and h(a, b, c) = abc - 23 = 0.
The method of Lagrange multipliers tells us that at the extremum, the gradients satisfy:
∇f = λ∇g + μ∇h

And the constraints:
ab + bc + ca = 27
abc = 23
That's a system of five equations with five variables (a, b, c, λ, μ). This looks complicated, but maybe we can find symmetry or make substitutions.
Alternatively, maybe express variables in terms of each other. Since abc = 23, and 23 is a prime number, if a, b, c are required to be integers, but in the problem statement, there is no such restriction, so perhaps they can be real numbers. However, given that 23 is prime, if the sides are required to be integers, the only possibility would be 1,1,23, but let's check the surface area: 2(ab + bc + ca) = 2(1*1 + 1*23 + 1*23) = 2(1 + 23 + 23) = 2(47) = 94, which is not 54. So, the sides must be non-integers.
Therefore, we can consider a, b, c as real numbers.
Alternatively, suppose two variables are equal. Let's assume some symmetry. Let’s assume two sides are equal, say a = b. Then we can express everything in terms of a and c.
Let a = b. Then, the constraints become:
a2 + 2ac = 27 (since ab + bc + ca = a2 + 2ac)
a2*c = 23
We need to express c in terms of a. From the second equation: c = 23/a2. Plug into the first equation:
a2 + 2a*(23/a2) = 27
Simplify:
a2 + 46/a = 27
Multiply both sides by a:
a3 + 46 = 27a
Thus:
a3 - 27a + 46 = 0
Let’s solve for a. Rational root theorem suggests possible roots are factors of 46. Possible rational roots: ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46. Testing a = 2:
8 -54 +46 = 0. Yes! 8 -54 is -46, plus 46 = 0. So a = 2 is a root.
Therefore, we can factor out (a - 2). Dividing a3 -27a +46 by (a -2):
Use synthetic division:
2 | 1   0   -27   46
        2    4    -46
      1   2   -23    0
So, the quotient is a2 + 2a -23. So, factoring:
(a -2)(a2 + 2a -23) = 0
Solving quadratic: a = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ± 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 ± 2*sqrt(6)
But since a is a length, it must be positive. So a = -1 + 2*sqrt(6) ≈ -1 + 4.899 ≈ 3.899. The other root is negative. Therefore, possible values for a are 2 and -1 + 2*sqrt(6). Let's think in parallel.

1: When a=b=2, the side length c is calculated as 23/(2^2) = 23/4 = 5.75. The sum of squares a^2 + b^2 + c^2 is then 2*(2^2) + (23/4)^2 = 8 + (529/16) = (128 + 529)/16 = 657/16, which is approximately 4.1875.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The case where a = b = -1 + 2*sqrt(6) is considered. This value of a is approximately 3.899. The side length c is calculated as 23 divided by a squared, which is 23 / (-1 + 2*sqrt(6))². The expression for c simplifies to 23 / (1 - 4*sqrt(6) + 24), which is 23 / (25 - 4*sqrt(6)). This result is approximately 0.549.
The sum a^2 + b^2 + c^2 is then computed.
The value of a^2 is (-1 + 2*sqrt(6))², which equals 1 - 4*sqrt(6) + 24, simplifying to 25 - 4*sqrt(6).
The sum a^2 + b^2 is therefore 2*(25 - 4*sqrt(6)), which is 50 - 8*sqrt(6).
The sum a^2 + b^2 + c^2 is the sum of 50 - 8*sqrt(6) and c², which is (23 / (25 - 4*sqrt(6)))².
The exact expression for c² is (23²) / (25 - 4*sqrt(6))², which equals 529 / (25 - 4*sqrt(6))².
The sum a^2 + b^2 + c^2 is thus 50 - 8*sqrt(6) + 529 / (25 - 4*sqrt(6))².
The denominator (25 - 4*sqrt(6))² expands to 625 - 200*sqrt(6) + 96, which is 721 - 200*sqrt(6).
Consequently, the sum a^2 + b^2 + c^2 is 50 - 8*sqrt(6) + 529 / (721 - 200*sqrt(6)).
This sum is approximately 50 - 8*2.449 + 529 / (721 - 200*2.449), which is about 50 - 19.592 + 529 / (721 - 489.8).
This simplifies to approximately 30.408 + 529 / 231.2, which is about 30.408 + 2.288, resulting in approximately 32.696.
This value is approximately 32.696, which is smaller than the value obtained when a=b=2.
The case where a=b=2 yields a larger value for a^2 + b^2 + c^2.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
When a=b=2, the sum of squares a^2 + b^2 + c^2 is 657/16 (approximately 41.0625). When a=b=-1+2*sqrt(6), this sum is approximately 32.696, which is smaller.

</Parallel>
Therefore, the maximum of a2 + b2 + c2 is 657/16 ≈41.0625, which occurs when two sides are 2 and the third is 23/4=5.75. So, in this case, the radius squared would be (a2 + b2 + c2)/4 = 657/(16*4) = 657/64 ≈10.2734375. But 657 and 64: are they coprime? 657 divided by 64 is 10 with remainder 17, so 657 = 10*64 +17. 64 and 17: GCD(64,17)=1, since 64=3*17 +13, 17=1*13+4, 13=3*4+1, GCD=1. Then GCD(657,64)=1. Therefore, p=657, q=64, p+q=721. Wait, but the problem says "the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of B". So, if there's another box in B with a larger space diagonal, then we need to take that one.
But in this problem, when a=b=2, c=23/4, does this correspond to a valid box in B? Let's check the surface area and volume. Volume: 2*2*(23/4)= (4)*(23/4)= (4*(23/4))=23. Correct. Surface area: 2(ab + bc + ca)=2[2*2 +2*(23/4) +2*(23/4)]=2[4 + (46/4)+(46/4)]=2[4 + 23/2 +23/2]=2[4 +23]=2*(27)=54. Correct. So, this is a valid box. Similarly, the other case where a=-1+2*sqrt(6)≈3.899, c≈0.549. Let's check the volume and surface area for that. Let me compute abc= a2c. Since a =-1 + 2*sqrt(6), a2=1 -4*sqrt(6)+24=25 -4*sqrt(6). Then c=23/a2=23/(25 -4*sqrt(6)). Therefore, a2*c=23/(25 -4*sqrt(6))*(25 -4*sqrt(6))=23. So, abc=23, correct. Surface area: ab + bc + ca. Since a=b, ab + bc + ca= a2 +2ac= a2 + 2*(23/a2)*a= a2 + 46/a. Earlier, when a was set to this value, we found that a3 -27a +46=0, which led us to a=2 or a=-1+2*sqrt(6). For a=-1+2*sqrt(6): Let's compute a3 -27a +46. First, compute a3. a= -1 + 2*sqrt(6). Let’s compute step by step. Let’s denote s = sqrt(6). Then a = -1 + 2s. a2 = ( -1 + 2s )2 =1 -4s +4s2=1 -4s +4*6=1 -4s +24=25 -4s. a3 =a2 *a=(25 -4s)(-1 +2s)=25*(-1) +25*2s -4s*(-1) -4s*2s= -25 +50s +4s -8s2= -25 +54s + (-8*6)= -25 +54s -48= -73 +54s. Then a3 -27a +46= (-73 +54s) -27*(-1 +2s) +46= -73 +54s +27 -54s +46= (-73 +27 +46) + (54s -54s)= (-73 +73) +0=0. Correct, so ab + bc + ca=27. Therefore, this a is valid. So, both cases give valid boxes, but when a=2, the space diagonal squared is 657/16, which is larger than when a≈3.899, which gives a2 + b2 + c2≈32.696. Therefore, the maximum is 657/16. Therefore, the radius squared is 657/64, which is 657/64. Then p=657, q=64, which are coprime as established earlier. So p+q=657+64=721. But wait, hold on. Wait, but the problem says "the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of B". So, if there's another box in B with a larger space diagonal, then we need to take that one. But in this problem, when a=b=2, c=23/4, does this correspond to a valid box in B? Let's check the surface area and volume. Volume: 2*2*(23/4)= (4)*(23/4)=23. Correct. Surface area: 2(ab + bc + ca)=2[2*2 +2*(23/4) +2*(23/4)]=2[4 + (46/4)+(46/4)]=2[4 + 23/2 +23/2]=2[4 +23]=2*(27)=54. Correct. So, this is a valid box. Similarly, the other case where a=-1+2*sqrt(6)≈3.899, c≈0.549. Let's check the volume and surface area for that. Let me compute abc= a2c. Since a =-1 + 2*sqrt(6), a2=1 -4*sqrt(6)+24=25 -4*sqrt(6). Then c=23/a2=23/(25 -4*sqrt(6)). Therefore, a2*c=23/(25 -4*sqrt(6))*(25 -4*sqrt(6))=23. So, abc=23, correct. Surface area: ab + bc + ca. Since a=b, ab + bc + ca= a2 +2ac= a2 + 2*(23/a2)*a= a2 + 46/a. Earlier, when a was set to this value, we found that a3 -27a +46=0, which led us to a=2 or a=-1+2*sqrt(6). For a=-1+2*sqrt(6): Let’s compute a3 -27a +46. First, compute a3. a= -1 + 2*sqrt(6). Let’s compute step by step. Let’s denote s = sqrt(6). Then a = -1 + 2s. a2 = ( -1 + 2s )2 =1 -4s +4s2=1 -4s +4*6=1 -4s +24=25 -4s. a3 =a2 *a=(25 -4s)(-1 +2s)=25*(-1) +25*2s -4s*(-1) -4s*2s= -25 +50s +4s -8s2= -25 +54s + (-8*6)= -25 +54s -48= -73 +54s. Then a3 -27a +46= (-73 +54s) -27*(-1 +2s) +46= -73 +54s +27 -54s +46= (-73 +27 +46) + (54s -54s)= (-73 +73) +0=0. Correct, so ab + bc + ca=27. Therefore, this a is valid. So, both cases give valid boxes, but when a=2, the space diagonal squared is 657/16, which is larger than when a≈3.899, which gives a2 + b2 + c2≈32.696. Therefore, the maximum is 657/16. Therefore, the radius squared is 657/64, which is 657/64. Then p=657, q=64, which are coprime as established earlier. So p+q=657+64=721. Therefore, the answer is 721.
Wait, but now I have a doubt. Since we found two boxes in B: one with sides 2,2,23/4 and the other with sides approximately 3.899, 3.899, 0.549. The first has a larger space diagonal, hence requires a larger sphere. Therefore, to contain all boxes in B (both of these and potentially others), we need a sphere that can contain the one with the largest space diagonal. So, the critical one is the first box with sides 2,2,23/4. Thus, r2=657/64, so p+q=721.
But wait, perhaps there's another box configuration (not assuming two sides equal) that gives an even larger space diagonal? So, maybe we need to check if the maximum occurs when all variables are different. But in optimization under multiple constraints, it's possible that the extremum is achieved at a critical point where variables are equal, but in this case, when we assumed a=b, we found a higher value for a2 + b2 + c2. Maybe that is indeed the maximum. Alternatively, maybe there's a box with unequal sides that gives a larger space diagonal. Let's check.
Suppose we have three numbers a, b, c such that abc=23 and ab + bc + ca=27. Let's see if making the sides more unequal can increase a2 + b2 + c2. Note that by the inequality: (a + b + c)2 = a2 + b2 + c2 + 2(ab + bc + ca). So, given ab + bc + ca=27, then (a + b + c)2 = a2 + b2 + c2 +54. But I don't know the sum a + b + c here. Alternatively, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers as we started earlier.
But let me see. Let’s suppose that one side is much larger and the other two are small. For example, let a approaches 23, then b and c approach 1 (since abc=23). Then ab + bc + ca ≈ a(b + c) + bc ≈23*(something) + bc. But to get ab + bc + ca=27, if a is large, say 23, then 23b +23c + bc=27. But bc≈ (23)(1)(1)=23 if b and c are 1, but then 23*1 +23*1 +1*1=46 +1=47, which is larger than 27. So, actually, if a is large, then b and c must be small. Let's see. Let me take a=23, then bc=1. Then ab + bc + ca=23b +1 +23c. We need 23b +23c +1=27 => 23(b + c)=26 => b + c=26/23 ≈1.130. But bc=1. So, solving b + c =26/23 and bc=1. The solutions are roots of x2 - (26/23)x +1=0. The discriminant is (26/23)^2 -4= (676/529) -4= (676 -2116)/529= -1440/529 <0. Therefore, no real solutions. Therefore, a cannot be 23. Therefore, such a case is impossible.
Alternatively, take a medium-sized. For example, suppose we take a=1, then bc=23, and ab + bc + ca=1*b +23 +1*c= b + c +23=27. Therefore, b + c=4. Then, bc=23, so quadratic equation x2 -4x +23=0, which has discriminant 16 -92= -76 <0. No real solutions. Therefore, this is impossible.
Another attempt: a= sqrt(23), so that bc= sqrt(23). Then ab + bc + ca= a(b + c) + bc= sqrt(23)(b + c) + sqrt(23)= sqrt(23)(b + c +1)=27. Therefore, b + c +1=27/sqrt(23). But bc= sqrt(23). Let’s set variable s = b + c, so s +1=27/sqrt(23). Solving for s: s =27/sqrt(23) -1. Also, we have bc= sqrt(23). Then, b and c are roots of x2 -sx + sqrt(23)=0. The discriminant must be non-negative: s2 -4 sqrt(23) >=0. So, s >= 2 sqrt(sqrt(23))≈2*sqrt(4.7958)≈2*2.19≈4.38. But 27/sqrt(23) -1≈27/4.7958 -1≈5.625 -1≈4.625. So s≈4.625. Since 4.625 >=4.38, so possible. Therefore, discriminant≈(4.625)^2 -4*sqrt(23)≈21.39 -4*4.795≈21.39 -19.18≈2.21>0. Therefore, real solutions exist. Therefore, in this case, the sides a=sqrt(23)≈4.7958, and two other sides b and c≈ solutions. Then, compute a2 + b2 + c2. a2=23, b2 + c2= (b + c)^2 -2bc= s2 - 2 sqrt(23). If s≈4.625, then s2≈21.39. sqrt(23)≈4.7958. So, b2 + c2≈21.39 -2*4.7958≈21.39 -9.5916≈11.798. Therefore, total a2 + b2 + c2≈23 +11.8≈34.8. Which is less than 657/16≈41.06.
Alternatively, if we take a=3, then bc=23/3≈7.6667. ab + bc + ca=3b +3c + bc=3(b + c) +7.6667=27. So, 3(b + c)=27 -7.6667≈19.3333. Therefore, b + c≈6.4444. bc≈7.6667. So, quadratic equation x2 -6.4444x +7.6667=0. Discriminant= (6.4444)^2 -4*7.6667≈41.54 -30.6668≈10.873. Real roots. So, roots are [6.4444 ± sqrt(10.873)]/2≈[6.4444 ±3.299]/2. So, approximately [9.7434]/2≈4.8717 and [3.1454]/2≈1.5727. Thus, sides a=3, b≈4.8717, c≈1.5727. Then, compute a2 + b2 + c2=9 + (4.8717)^2 + (1.5727)^2≈9 +23.727 +2.473≈35.2. Again, less than 657/16≈41.06.
Another case: a= sqrt(23/3)≈2.844, bc= sqrt(3*23)= sqrt(69)≈8.306. ab + bc + ca= a(b + c) + bc≈2.844*(b + c) +8.306=27. So, 2.844*(b + c)=18.694. Thus, b + c≈18.694/2.844≈6.57. Also, bc≈8.306. So quadratic equation x2 -6.57x +8.306=0. Discriminant=6.572 -4*8.306≈43.17 -33.224≈9.946. Thus, roots≈[6.57 ±3.156]/2≈[9.726]/2≈4.863 or [3.414]/2≈1.707. Therefore, sides≈2.844,4.863,1.707. Compute sum of squares: (2.844)^2 + (4.863)^2 + (1.707)^2≈8.09 +23.64 +2.91≈34.64. Still less than 657/16≈41.06.
Thus, in all these attempts, the maximum sum of squares is achieved when two sides are equal to 2, and the third is 23/4=5.75. Therefore, the conclusion is that the maximum a2 + b2 + c2 is 657/16, so the radius squared is 657/64, hence p=657, q=64, and p+q=721.
Therefore, the answer is 721.
**Final Answer**

solve the following math problem: let $\mathcal{b}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\mathcal{b}$. the value of $r^2$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. find $p+q$.

okay, so i need to solve this problem where we have a set of rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and volume 23. we need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes. then, find r2 which can be written as p/q where p and q are coprime, and then find p+q. alright, let's start breaking this down.
first, let me recall that a rectangular box has a surface area given by 2(ab + bc + ca), where a, b, c are the lengths of the sides. the volume is abc. here, they tell us that the surface area is 54 and the volume is 23. so, we have:
2(ab + bc + ca) = 54 => ab + bc + ca = 27
abc = 23
we need to find the smallest sphere (i.e., the minimal radius r) that can contain any rectangular box satisfying the above. the radius squared is requested, as p/q.
hmm. so, the sphere has to contain the entire box. the smallest sphere that can contain a rectangular box is the one whose diameter is the space diagonal of the box. wait, is that right?
let me think. for a rectangular box, the sphere that contains it must have a radius at least as large as half the length of the space diagonal of the box. because the space diagonal is the longest distance between any two vertices of the box. so, if the sphere has a radius equal to half the space diagonal, then the box would fit perfectly inside the sphere, with the center of the sphere at the center of the box.
therefore, the radius r of the smallest sphere containing the box is (1/2)*sqrt(a2 + b2 + c2). so, if we can find the minimal value of sqrt(a2 + b2 + c2)/2 over all boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23, then square that to get r2.
wait, but the problem says "the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of b". so, we need a sphere that can contain all such boxes, right? but maybe i misread. wait, actually, the problem says "the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of b". so, each box in b must fit inside this sphere. so, we need the minimal r such that for every box in b, the space diagonal of the box is at most 2r. therefore, r is half the maximum space diagonal among all boxes in b. wait, no. wait, actually, if all boxes must fit into the same sphere, then the sphere must be large enough to contain all of them. but since the boxes can be oriented in different ways, but wait, in this problem, since it's about containing the boxes, which are fixed in their orientation as rectangular boxes, so the sphere needs to contain all the points of the box when placed, say, with edges aligned with coordinate axes. but in that case, the space diagonal is the diameter, so the radius would be half the space diagonal.
therefore, if all boxes in b must fit into the same sphere, then the required radius is the maximum over all boxes in b of (half the space diagonal). so, we need to find the maximum value of sqrt(a2 + b2 + c2)/2 for boxes in b, and that will be r. then, r2 is the maximum (a2 + b2 + c2)/4, so we need to find the maximum a2 + b2 + c2 given the constraints 2(ab + bc + ca) = 54 (surface area) and abc = 23.
wait, but that seems counterintuitive. if we need the smallest sphere that can contain each of the boxes, then if the boxes vary, the sphere must be large enough to contain the largest possible space diagonal among all such boxes. so, we need to maximize the space diagonal (i.e., sqrt(a2 + b2 + c2)) given the constraints, then divide by 2 to get r, then compute r2. therefore, the problem reduces to: maximize d = sqrt(a2 + b2 + c2) subject to ab + bc + ca = 27 and abc = 23. then, r2 = (d^2)/4.
so, we need to express this optimization problem. let's think in parallel.

1: the objective is to maximize the sum of squares of the side lengths, a^2 + b^2 + c^2, given the constraints ab + bc + ca = 27 and abc = 23. a potential approach is to fix two variables and solve for the third, though this could be complex. the am-qm inequality, which relates the arithmetic mean to the quadratic mean, might be applicable. the am-qm inequality states that the arithmetic mean of a set of non-negative numbers is less than or equal to their quadratic mean. for the side lengths a, b, and c, the arithmetic mean is (a+b+c)/3 and the quadratic mean is sqrt((a^2 + b^2 + c^2)/3). the inequality (a+b+c)/3 ≤ sqrt((a^2 + b^2 + c^2)/3) implies that a^2 + b^2 + c^2 is minimized when a, b, and c are equal, which corresponds to a cube. however, a cube with volume 23 would have side length 23^(1/3), which is approximately 2.843866, and its surface area would be 6*(2.843866)^2) ≈ 48. this calculated surface area of approximately 48 is less than the given surface area of 54. therefore, the given box cannot be a cube. this suggests that the maximum value of a^2 + b^2 + c^2 is sought, rather than the minimum, and that the maximum occurs when the variables are not all equal.
the problem requires finding the maximum value of a^2 + b^2 + c^2 under the constraints ab + bc + ca = 27 and abc = 23.
a lagrangian multiplier method can be employed for optimization with multiple constraints.
</path>
<path>
2: the possibility of the maximum occurring at a corner point is explored. a corner point is characterized by one side length approaching zero. if one side length approaches zero, the product of the other two sides must approach the constant volume of 23. the surface area constraint then becomes the sum of the products of these two large sides and the approaching zero side, which also approaches zero. this contradicts the given surface area of 27, meaning the maximum cannot occur at such a corner point.
</path>
<conclusion>
the maximum of a^2 + b^2 + c^2 does not occur at a critical point within the constraints (as a cube is not possible) nor at a corner point where a side length approaches zero.

let me consider three variables a, b, c with constraints ab + bc + ca = 27 and abc = 23. we need to maximize a2 + b2 + c2.
alternatively, perhaps use the method of lagrange multipliers. let’s set up the lagrangian.
let’s denote the function to maximize as f(a, b, c) = a2 + b2 + c2. the constraints are g(a, b, c) = ab + bc + ca - 27 = 0 and h(a, b, c) = abc - 23 = 0.
the method of lagrange multipliers tells us that at the extremum, the gradients satisfy:
∇f = λ∇g + μ∇h
so, computing component-wise:

</parallel>
and the constraints:
ab + bc + ca = 27
abc = 23
that's a system of five equations with five variables (a, b, c, λ, μ). this looks complicated, but maybe we can find symmetry or make substitutions.
alternatively, maybe express variables in terms of each other. since abc = 23, and 23 is a prime number, if a, b, c are required to be integers, but in the problem statement, there is no such restriction, so perhaps they can be real numbers. however, given that 23 is prime, if the sides are required to be integers, the only possibility would be 1,1,23, but let's check the surface area: 2(ab + bc + ca) = 2(1*1 + 1*23 + 1*23) = 2(1 + 23 + 23) = 2(47) = 94, which is not 54. so, the sides must be non-integers.
therefore, we can consider a, b, c as real numbers.
alternatively, suppose two variables are equal. let's assume some symmetry. let’s assume two sides are equal, say a = b. then we can express everything in terms of a and c.
let a = b. then, the constraints become:
a2 + 2ac = 27 (since ab + bc + ca = a2 + 2ac)
a2*c = 23
we need to express c in terms of a. from the second equation: c = 23/a2. plug into the first equation:
a2 + 2a*(23/a2) = 27
simplify:
a2 + 46/a = 27
multiply both sides by a:
a3 + 46 = 27a
thus:
a3 - 27a + 46 = 0
let’s solve for a. rational root theorem suggests possible roots are factors of 46. possible rational roots: ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46. testing a = 2:
8 -54 +46 = 0. yes! 8 -54 is -46, plus 46 = 0. so a = 2 is a root.
therefore, we can factor out (a - 2). dividing a3 -27a +46 by (a -2):
use synthetic division:
2 | 1   0   -27   46
        2    4    -46
      1   2   -23    0
so, the quotient is a2 + 2a -23. so, factoring:
(a -2)(a2 + 2a -23) = 0
solving quadratic: a = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ± 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 ± 2*sqrt(6)
but since a is a length, it must be positive. so a = -1 + 2*sqrt(6) ≈ -1 + 4.899 ≈ 3.899. the other root is negative. therefore, possible values for a are 2 and -1 + 2*sqrt(6). let's think in parallel.

<path>
1: when a=b=2, the side length c is calculated as 23/(2^2) = 23/4 = 5.75. the sum of squares a^2 + b^2 + c^2 is then 2*(2^2) + (23/4)^2 = 8 + (529/16) = (128 + 529)/16 = 657/16, which is approximately 4.1875.
</path>
<path>
2: the case where a = b = -1 + 2*sqrt(6) is considered. this value of a is approximately 3.899. the side length c is calculated as 23 divided by a squared, which is 23 / (-1 + 2*sqrt(6))². the expression for c simplifies to 23 / (1 - 4*sqrt(6) + 24), which is 23 / (25 - 4*sqrt(6)). this result is approximately 0.549.
the sum a^2 + b^2 + c^2 is then computed.
the value of a^2 is (-1 + 2*sqrt(6))², which equals 1 - 4*sqrt(6) + 24, simplifying to 25 - 4*sqrt(6).
the sum a^2 + b^2 is therefore 2*(25 - 4*sqrt(6)), which is 50 - 8*sqrt(6).
the sum a^2 + b^2 + c^2 is the sum of 50 - 8*sqrt(6) and c², which is (23 / (25 - 4*sqrt(6)))².
the exact expression for c² is (23²) / (25 - 4*sqrt(6))², which equals 529 / (25 - 4*sqrt(6))².
the sum a^2 + b^2 + c^2 is thus 50 - 8*sqrt(6) + 529 / (25 - 4*sqrt(6))².
the denominator (25 - 4*sqrt(6))² expands to 625 - 200*sqrt(6) + 96, which is 721 - 200*sqrt(6).
consequently, the sum a^2 + b^2 + c^2 is 50 - 8*sqrt(6) + 529 / (721 - 200*sqrt(6)).
this sum is approximately 50 - 8*2.449 + 529 / (721 - 200*2.449), which is about 50 - 19.592 + 529 / (721 - 489.8).
this simplifies to approximately 30.408 + 529 / 231.2, which is about 30.408 + 2.288, resulting in approximately 32.696.
this value is approximately 32.696, which is smaller than the value obtained when a=b=2.
the case where a=b=2 yields a larger value for a^2 + b^2 + c^2.
</path>
<conclusion>
when a=b=2, the sum of squares a^2 + b^2 + c^2 is 657/16 (approximately 41.0625). when a=b=-1+2*sqrt(6), this sum is approximately 32.696, which is smaller.
</conclusion>

therefore, the maximum of a2 + b2 + c2 is 657/16 ≈41.0625, which occurs when two sides are 2 and the third is 23/4=5.75. so, in this case, the radius squared would be (a2 + b2 + c2)/4 = 657/(16*4) = 657/64 ≈10.2734375. but 657 and 64: are they coprime? 657 divided by 64 is 10 with remainder 17, so 657 = 10*64 +17. 64 and 17: gcd(64,17)=1, since 64=3*17 +13, 17=1*13+4, 13=3*4+1, gcd=1. then gcd(657,64)=1. therefore, p=657, q=64, p+q=721. wait, but the problem says "the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of b". so, if there's another box in b with a larger space diagonal, then we need to take that one.
but in this problem, when a=b=2, c=23/4, does this correspond to a valid box in b? let's check the surface area and volume. volume: 2*2*(23/4)= (4)*(23/4)= (4*(23/4))=23. correct. surface area: 2(ab + bc + ca)=2[2*2 +2*(23/4) +2*(23/4)]=2[4 + (46/4)+(46/4)]=2[4 + 23/2 +23/2]=2[4 +23]=2*(27)=54. correct. so, this is a valid box. similarly, the other case where a=-1+2*sqrt(6)≈3.899, c≈0.549. let's check the volume and surface area for that. let me compute abc= a2c. since a =-1 + 2*sqrt(6), a2=1 -4*sqrt(6)+24=25 -4*sqrt(6). then c=23/a2=23/(25 -4*sqrt(6)). therefore, a2*c=23/(25 -4*sqrt(6))*(25 -4*sqrt(6))=23. so, abc=23, correct. surface area: ab + bc + ca. since a=b, ab + bc + ca= a2 +2ac= a2 + 2*(23/a2)*a= a2 + 46/a. earlier, when a was set to this value, we found that a3 -27a +46=0, which led us to a=2 or a=-1+2*sqrt(6). for a=-1+2*sqrt(6): let's compute a3 -27a +46. first, compute a3. a= -1 + 2*sqrt(6). let’s compute step by step. let’s denote s = sqrt(6). then a = -1 + 2s. a2 = ( -1 + 2s )2 =1 -4s +4s2=1 -4s +4*6=1 -4s +24=25 -4s. a3 =a2 *a=(25 -4s)(-1 +2s)=25*(-1) +25*2s -4s*(-1) -4s*2s= -25 +50s +4s -8s2= -25 +54s + (-8*6)= -25 +54s -48= -73 +54s. then a3 -27a +46= (-73 +54s) -27*(-1 +2s) +46= -73 +54s +27 -54s +46= (-73 +27 +46) + (54s -54s)= (-73 +73) +0=0. correct, so ab + bc + ca=27. therefore, this a is valid. so, both cases give valid boxes, but when a=2, the space diagonal squared is 657/16, which is larger than when a≈3.899, which gives a2 + b2 + c2≈32.696. therefore, the maximum is 657/16. therefore, the radius squared is 657/64, which is 657/64. then p=657, q=64, which are coprime as established earlier. so p+q=657+64=721. but wait, hold on. wait, but the problem says "the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of b". so, if there's another box in b with a larger space diagonal, then we need to take that one. but in this problem, when a=b=2, c=23/4, does this correspond to a valid box in b? let's check the surface area and volume. volume: 2*2*(23/4)= (4)*(23/4)=23. correct. surface area: 2(ab + bc + ca)=2[2*2 +2*(23/4) +2*(23/4)]=2[4 + (46/4)+(46/4)]=2[4 + 23/2 +23/2]=2[4 +23]=2*(27)=54. correct. so, this is a valid box. similarly, the other case where a=-1+2*sqrt(6)≈3.899, c≈0.549. let's check the volume and surface area for that. let me compute abc= a2c. since a =-1 + 2*sqrt(6), a2=1 -4*sqrt(6)+24=25 -4*sqrt(6). then c=23/a2=23/(25 -4*sqrt(6)). therefore, a2*c=23/(25 -4*sqrt(6))*(25 -4*sqrt(6))=23. so, abc=23, correct. surface area: ab + bc + ca. since a=b, ab + bc + ca= a2 +2ac= a2 + 2*(23/a2)*a= a2 + 46/a. earlier, when a was set to this value, we found that a3 -27a +46=0, which led us to a=2 or a=-1+2*sqrt(6). for a=-1+2*sqrt(6): let’s compute a3 -27a +46. first, compute a3. a= -1 + 2*sqrt(6). let’s compute step by step. let’s denote s = sqrt(6). then a = -1 + 2s. a2 = ( -1 + 2s )2 =1 -4s +4s2=1 -4s +4*6=1 -4s +24=25 -4s. a3 =a2 *a=(25 -4s)(-1 +2s)=25*(-1) +25*2s -4s*(-1) -4s*2s= -25 +50s +4s -8s2= -25 +54s + (-8*6)= -25 +54s -48= -73 +54s. then a3 -27a +46= (-73 +54s) -27*(-1 +2s) +46= -73 +54s +27 -54s +46= (-73 +27 +46) + (54s -54s)= (-73 +73) +0=0. correct, so ab + bc + ca=27. therefore, this a is valid. so, both cases give valid boxes, but when a=2, the space diagonal squared is 657/16, which is larger than when a≈3.899, which gives a2 + b2 + c2≈32.696. therefore, the maximum is 657/16. therefore, the radius squared is 657/64, which is 657/64. then p=657, q=64, which are coprime as established earlier. so p+q=657+64=721. therefore, the answer is 721.
wait, but now i have a doubt. since we found two boxes in b: one with sides 2,2,23/4 and the other with sides approximately 3.899, 3.899, 0.549. the first has a larger space diagonal, hence requires a larger sphere. therefore, to contain all boxes in b (both of these and potentially others), we need a sphere that can contain the one with the largest space diagonal. so, the critical one is the first box with sides 2,2,23/4. thus, r2=657/64, so p+q=721.
but wait, perhaps there's another box configuration (not assuming two sides equal) that gives an even larger space diagonal? so, maybe we need to check if the maximum occurs when all variables are different. but in optimization under multiple constraints, it's possible that the extremum is achieved at a critical point where variables are equal, but in this case, when we assumed a=b, we found a higher value for a2 + b2 + c2. maybe that is indeed the maximum. alternatively, maybe there's a box with unequal sides that gives a larger space diagonal. let's check.
suppose we have three numbers a, b, c such that abc=23 and ab + bc + ca=27. let's see if making the sides more unequal can increase a2 + b2 + c2. note that by the inequality: (a + b + c)2 = a2 + b2 + c2 + 2(ab + bc + ca). so, given ab + bc + ca=27, then (a + b + c)2 = a2 + b2 + c2 +54. but i don't know the sum a + b + c here. alternatively, we can use the method of lagrange multipliers as we started earlier.
but let me see. let’s suppose that one side is much larger and the other two are small. for example, let a approaches 23, then b and c approach 1 (since abc=23). then ab + bc + ca ≈ a(b + c) + bc ≈23*(something) + bc. but to get ab + bc + ca=27, if a is large, say 23, then 23b +23c + bc=27. but bc≈ (23)(1)(1)=23 if b and c are 1, but then 23*1 +23*1 +1*1=46 +1=47, which is larger than 27. so, actually, if a is large, then b and c must be small. let's see. let me take a=23, then bc=1. then ab + bc + ca=23b +1 +23c. we need 23b +23c +1=27 => 23(b + c)=26 => b + c=26/23 ≈1.130. but bc=1. so, solving b + c =26/23 and bc=1. the solutions are roots of x2 - (26/23)x +1=0. the discriminant is (26/23)^2 -4= (676/529) -4= (676 -2116)/529= -1440/529 <0. therefore, no real solutions. therefore, a cannot be 23. therefore, such a case is impossible.
alternatively, take a medium-sized. for example, suppose we take a=1, then bc=23, and ab + bc + ca=1*b +23 +1*c= b + c +23=27. therefore, b + c=4. then, bc=23, so quadratic equation x2 -4x +23=0, which has discriminant 16 -92= -76 <0. no real solutions. therefore, this is impossible.
another attempt: a= sqrt(23), so that bc= sqrt(23). then ab + bc + ca= a(b + c) + bc= sqrt(23)(b + c) + sqrt(23)= sqrt(23)(b + c +1)=27. therefore, b + c +1=27/sqrt(23). but bc= sqrt(23). let’s set variable s = b + c, so s +1=27/sqrt(23). solving for s: s =27/sqrt(23) -1. also, we have bc= sqrt(23). then, b and c are roots of x2 -sx + sqrt(23)=0. the discriminant must be non-negative: s2 -4 sqrt(23) >=0. so, s >= 2 sqrt(sqrt(23))≈2*sqrt(4.7958)≈2*2.19≈4.38. but 27/sqrt(23) -1≈27/4.7958 -1≈5.625 -1≈4.625. so s≈4.625. since 4.625 >=4.38, so possible. therefore, discriminant≈(4.625)^2 -4*sqrt(23)≈21.39 -4*4.795≈21.39 -19.18≈2.21>0. therefore, real solutions exist. therefore, in this case, the sides a=sqrt(23)≈4.7958, and two other sides b and c≈ solutions. then, compute a2 + b2 + c2. a2=23, b2 + c2= (b + c)^2 -2bc= s2 - 2 sqrt(23). if s≈4.625, then s2≈21.39. sqrt(23)≈4.7958. so, b2 + c2≈21.39 -2*4.7958≈21.39 -9.5916≈11.798. therefore, total a2 + b2 + c2≈23 +11.8≈34.8. which is less than 657/16≈41.06.
alternatively, if we take a=3, then bc=23/3≈7.6667. ab + bc + ca=3b +3c + bc=3(b + c) +7.6667=27. so, 3(b + c)=27 -7.6667≈19.3333. therefore, b + c≈6.4444. bc≈7.6667. so, quadratic equation x2 -6.4444x +7.6667=0. discriminant= (6.4444)^2 -4*7.6667≈41.54 -30.6668≈10.873. real roots. so, roots are [6.4444 ± sqrt(10.873)]/2≈[6.4444 ±3.299]/2. so, approximately [9.7434]/2≈4.8717 and [3.1454]/2≈1.5727. thus, sides a=3, b≈4.8717, c≈1.5727. then, compute a2 + b2 + c2=9 + (4.8717)^2 + (1.5727)^2≈9 +23.727 +2.473≈35.2. again, less than 657/16≈41.06.
another case: a= sqrt(23/3)≈2.844, bc= sqrt(3*23)= sqrt(69)≈8.306. ab + bc + ca= a(b + c) + bc≈2.844*(b + c) +8.306=27. so, 2.844*(b + c)=18.694. thus, b + c≈18.694/2.844≈6.57. also, bc≈8.306. so quadratic equation x2 -6.57x +8.306=0. discriminant=6.572 -4*8.306≈43.17 -33.224≈9.946. thus, roots≈[6.57 ±3.156]/2≈[9.726]/2≈4.863 or [3.414]/2≈1.707. therefore, sides≈2.844,4.863,1.707. compute sum of squares: (2.844)^2 + (4.863)^2 + (1.707)^2≈8.09 +23.64 +2.91≈34.64. still less than 657/16≈41.06.
thus, in all these attempts, the maximum sum of squares is achieved when two sides are equal to 2, and the third is 23/4=5.75. therefore, the conclusion is that the maximum a2 + b2 + c2 is 657/16, so the radius squared is 657/64, hence p=657, q=64, and p+q=721.
therefore, the answer is 721.

answer: given the set \(\mathcal{b}\) of rectangular boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23, we need to find the radius \(r\) of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes. the value of \(r^2\) is to be expressed as \(\frac{p}{q}\) where \(p\) and \(q\) are coprime positive integers, and then \(p+q\) is to be found.

1. **surface area and volume constraints**:
   - surface area: \(2(ab + bc + ca) = 54 \implies ab + bc + ca = 27\)
   - volume: \(abc = 23\)

2. **optimization problem**:
   - the radius \(r\) of the smallest sphere containing a rectangular box is \(\frac{1
