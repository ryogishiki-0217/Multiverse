Okay, so I need to solve this problem where I have to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000.
Here, ω is a 13th root of unity, not equal to 1.
Alright, let's start breaking this down.
First, I remember that roots of unity are solutions to the equation x^n = 1.
So, for n=13, these are the complex numbers ω such that ω^13 = 1.
Since ω ≠ 1, we're considering the primitive 13th roots of unity.
The polynomial equation they satisfy is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1.
So, ω^k for k from 0 to 12 are all the roots, right?
But ω^0 is 1, and the problem states ω ≠ 1, but the product includes k=0.
 Wait, ω^0 is 1, but when k=0, the term becomes (2 - 2*1 + 1^2) = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1.
So that term is 1.
But the problem says ω ≠ 1, but the product is over all k from 0 to 12, which includes ω^0 = 1.
Hmm, maybe that's just the term when k=0.
Wait, the problem says "Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity."
Then, perhaps we are to consider ω as a primitive 13th root of unity, so ω^k for k from 0 to 12 gives all 13th roots of unity, including 1.
But since ω ≠ 1, maybe the product is over k where ω^k ≠ 1?
Wait, no.
The product is from k=0 to 12, so it includes all 13 terms, but when k=0, ω^0=1, but the term becomes (2 - 2*1 + 1) = 1.
So the product is 1 multiplied by the other terms.
So, maybe even though ω ≠1, the product still includes that term.
Wait, but maybe the problem is considering ω as a primitive root, so ω^k is never 1 for 1 ≤ k ≤ 12.
But in the product, when k=0, we have ω^0=1.
So, perhaps the product is from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}), so including that term when ω^k=1.
But in that case, when ω^k=1 (i.e., k=0), the term is (2 - 2*1 + 1) = 1, as above.
So, the product is 1 multiplied by the other terms.
So, perhaps the product can be written as 1 * Π_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).
But then, since ω^k for k=1 to 12 are the primitive 13th roots of unity.
Alternatively, maybe we can consider the product over all 13th roots of unity, but since the term for ω=1 is 1, the entire product is equal to the product over all 13th roots of unity of (2 - 2ω + ω^2).
Wait, but if we include ω=1, then the product becomes Π_{ω^13=1} (2 - 2ω + ω^2).
Then, maybe we can evaluate this product.
Let me think.
Let me consider the polynomial P(x) = x^{13} - 1.
The roots are all the 13th roots of unity.
So, we can factor P(x) as Π_{k=0}^{12} (x - ω^k).
But in our case, the product is Π_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).
Hmm, how can we relate this to the polynomial?
Alternatively, maybe we can rewrite the term (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) as a polynomial in ω^k.
Let me denote y = ω^k.
Then, each term is (2 - 2y + y^2).
So, the product becomes Π_{y^13=1} (2 - 2y + y^2).
So, we need to compute the product of (y^2 - 2y + 2) over all roots y of the equation y^13 = 1.
So, in other words, evaluate Π_{y^13=1} (y^2 - 2y + 2).
So, how do we compute this product?
Let me recall that for a polynomial Q(y) whose roots are the 13th roots of unity, the product Π_{y^13=1} (y^2 - 2y + 2) can be related to Q(y) divided by some other term.
Wait, perhaps we can use the fact that the product of (y - a_i) over all roots a_i is Q(y).
So, if we have a polynomial R(y) = y^2 - 2y + 2, and we want to compute the product R(y) over all roots y of y^13 - 1.
Alternatively, think of the product Π_{y^13=1} (y^2 - 2y + 2).
This is equivalent to substituting each root y of x^{13} - 1 into the polynomial R(y) = y^2 - 2y + 2 and multiplying all those values together.
Is there a way to compute this product without explicitly knowing the roots?
I remember that for a polynomial, the product of the values of a polynomial at the roots of another polynomial can be found using resultants or by using properties of polynomials.
Alternatively, perhaps consider that the product Π_{y^13=1} (R(y)) is equal to the resultant of the polynomials x^{13} - 1 and R(x).
Wait, the resultant of two polynomials f and g is equal to the product of f(α) where α runs over the roots of g, times the leading coefficient of f raised to the degree of g.
But here, we have f(x) = x^{13} -1 and g(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2.
So, the resultant Res(f, g) is equal to Π_{α^13=1} g(α) times the leading coefficient of f raised to the degree of g.
But since the leading coefficient of f is 1, it's just Π_{α^13=1} g(α).
So, the resultant of x^{13} -1 and x^2 - 2x + 2 is equal to our desired product.
Therefore, if I can compute the resultant of these two polynomials, that would give me the product.
But how do I compute the resultant?
The resultant of two polynomials f and g can be computed as the determinant of the Sylvester matrix, or using the Euclidean algorithm.
Let me recall that the resultant Res(f, g) is equal to the determinant of the Sylvester matrix, which is constructed by the coefficients of f and g.
But that might be tedious for degree 13 and 2.
Alternatively, using the Euclidean algorithm: the resultant is equal to (−1)^{deg f \cdot deg g} leading_coefficient^{\deg g - \deg r_1} \cdot r_1(0)^{\deg r_2} \cdot \ldots, but maybe that's not straightforward.
Wait, perhaps another approach.
Let me consider the polynomial Q(x) = x^{13} - 1.
Let’s think about how the product Π_{y^13=1} (x^2 - 2x + 2) relates to Q(x).
But actually, we need to evaluate the product at x = y, where y runs over the roots of Q(x).
Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that the polynomial whose roots are the squares of the roots of Q(x), or something else.
Wait, perhaps factor the quadratic term.
Let me look at x^2 - 2x + 2.
This factors as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).
So, the roots are 1 + i and 1 - i.
Therefore, the product Π_{y^13=1} (y^2 - 2y + 2) = Π_{y^13=1} (y - (1 + i))(y - (1 -i)) = [Π_{y^13=1} (y - (1 + i))] [Π_{y^13=1} (y - (1 -i))].
So, this product is equal to Q(1 + i) * Q(1 - i), where Q(x) = x^{13} - 1.
Wait, but Q(1 + i) is (1 + i)^{13} - 1 and Q(1 - i) is (1 - i)^{13} -1.
Therefore, the product is [(1 + i)^{13} -1][(1 - i)^13 -1].
So, maybe computing these two terms and multiplying them together will give the desired product.
Then, we can compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.
Let me recall that 1 + i and 1 - i can be expressed in polar form.
The modulus of 1 + i is sqrt(2), and its argument is π/4.
Similarly, 1 - i has modulus sqrt(2) and argument -π/4.
Therefore, (1 + i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{i * 13 * π/4}
Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{-i * 13 * π/4}
Compute [sqrt(2)]^13.
sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so [2^{1/2}]^13 = 2^{13/2}.
Therefore, (1 + i)^13 = 2^{13/2} * e^{i * 13π/4}
Similarly for (1 - i)^13 = 2^{13/2} * e^{-i * 13π/4}
So, (1 + i)^13 -1 = 2^{13/2} * e^{i * (13π/4)} -1
Similarly, (1 - i)^13 -1 = 2^{13/2} * e^{-i * (13π/4)} -1
Therefore, the product [(1 + i)^13 -1][(1 -i)^13 -1] = [2^{13/2} e^{i 13π/4} -1][2^{13/2} e^{-i 13π/4} -1]
Let me compute this product.
Let me denote for simplicity z = 2^{13/2} e^{i 13π/4}.
Then, the product is (z -1)(\overline{z} -1) = |z -1|^2.
Because when you multiply (z - a)(\overline{z} - a), it's |z - a|^2, but here a =1.
Wait, yes.
So, |z -1|^2.
Therefore, the product is the modulus squared of z -1, where z = 2^{13/2} e^{i 13π/4}.
First, let's simplify the angle 13π/4.
Since angles are modulo 2π, 13π/4 = (13π/4 - 3*2π) because 2π = 8π/4.
So, 3*2π = 6π = 24π/4.
Wait, 13π/4 - 24π/4 = -11π/4.
Alternatively, adding 8π/4 three times to 13π/4?
Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 13π/4 mod 2π.
13π/4 divided by 2π is (13π/4)/(2π) = 13/8 = 1.625.
So, 1 full rotation (2π) is 8π/4, so 13π/4 - 8π/4 = 5π/4.
Therefore, 13π/4 is equivalent to 5π/4.
Therefore, e^{i 13π/4} = e^{i 5π/4}.
So, e^{i 13π/4} = e^{i (π + π/4)} = -e^{i π/4}.
Therefore, z = 2^{13/2} e^{i 5π/4} = 2^{13/2} * (-e^{i π/4}) = -2^{13/2} e^{i π/4}.
Similarly, 2^{13/2} is 2^{6} * sqrt(2)} = 64 * sqrt(2).
But maybe let's keep it as 2^{13/2}.
Therefore, z = -2^{13/2} e^{i π/4}
Similarly, then z -1 = -2^{13/2} e^{i π/4} -1.
So, to compute |z -1|^2, we can write z -1 in terms of its real and imaginary parts.
First, e^{i π/4} = cos(π/4) + i sin(π/4) = √2/2 + i√2/2.
Therefore, z = -2^{13/2} * (√2/2 + i√2/2) = -2^{13/2} * √2/2 (1 + i)
Simplify 2^{13/2} * √2/2: 2^{13/2} = 2^{6 + 1/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * √2.
Then, multiplying by √2/2 gives 64 * √2 * √2 /2 = 64 * 2 /2 = 64.
Therefore, z = -64*(1 + i).
Therefore, z -1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i.
Therefore, |z -1|^2 = (-65)^2 + (-64)^2 = 65^2 + 64^2.
Compute 65^2 = 4225, 64^2 = 4096.
So, 4225 + 4096 = 8321.
Therefore, the product [(1 + i)^13 -1][(1 -i)^13 -1] = |z -1|^2 = 8321.
Therefore, the product Π_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) = 8321.
Then, we need to find the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000.
So, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8*1000=8000, with remainder 321.
Therefore, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.
So, the answer is 321.
But let me verify the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.
First, I noticed that the product over all 13th roots of unity of (y^2 - 2y +2) is equal to the product of (1 + i) and (1 -i) substituted into x^{13} -1.
Then, computed (1 + i)^13 and (1 -i)^13, each as 2^{13/2} e^{±i5π/4}, but then realized that 13π/4 is equivalent to 5π/4, but actually e^{i13π/4} = e^{i5π/4} since 13 mod 8 is 5, as each 2π is 8π/4.
Then converting that to polar form, calculating modulus, etc.
Then, converting z = 2^{13/2} e^{i5π/4} to rectangular form, simplified it to -64(1 + i).
Then, subtracted 1 to get -65 -64i, computed the modulus squared as 65^2 +64^2 = 8321.
Then, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.
That all checks out.
But let me double-check the calculation of z.
So, (1 + i)^13.
First, modulus is sqrt(2), raised to 13th power is (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2}.
Angle is 13 * π/4.
As 13 * π/4 = 3π + π/4 (since 12π/4=3π, so 13π/4 - 3π = π/4), but 3π is equivalent to -π, so 13π/4 mod 2π is π/4 - 2π?
Wait, no.
Wait, 13π/4 is 3 full rotations (3*2π) plus 5π/4.
Wait, 13π/4 = 3π + π/4.
But 3π is equivalent to π (since 2π is full rotation).
So, 3π + π/4 = π + π/4 = 5π/4.
So, yes, (1 + i)^13 = 2^{13/2} [cos(5π/4) + i sin(5π/4)] = 2^{13/2} (-√2/2 - i√2/2) = -2^{13/2} * √2/2 (1 + i) = -2^{7} (1 + i) = -128(1 + i).
Wait, wait.
Here's the mistake.
2^{13/2} is 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).
Then, multiplying by sqrt(2)/2 gives 64 * sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)/2 = 64 * 2 /2 = 64.
So, that gives -64(1 + i).
Wait, in my earlier calculation, I got -64(1 + i), but here you say 2^{13/2} is 64*sqrt(2), then times sqrt(2)/2 is 64*sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)/2 = 64*2/2 = 64.
So, indeed, z = -64(1 + i).
Therefore, z -1 = -64(1 + i) -1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i.
Therefore, modulus squared is (-65)^2 + (-64)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.
That's correct.
So, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.
Therefore, the answer is 321.
Wait, but before finalizing, let me check once more.
The product is from k=0 to 12, so includes k=0.
But when k=0, ω^0=1, so term is 2 - 2*1 +1 =1.
So, the product is 1 * rest of the terms.
However, the calculation above considered the product over all 13th roots of unity, which includes 1.
But when we evaluate Q(1 + i) which is (1 + i)^13 -1 and Q(1 -i) -1, then the product is (Q(1 + i))(Q(1 - i)) = [(1 +i)^13 -1] [ (1 -i)^13 -1 ].
But in our case, the product we want is Π_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k})).
But 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} = ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2.
So, as a polynomial in ω^k, which is equal to (ω^k - (1 +i))(ω^k - (1 -i)).
Therefore, the product over all k from 0 to 12 is Π_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 +i))(ω^k - (1 -i))).
But since ω varies over all 13th roots of unity, this product becomes Π_{ω^13=1} (ω - (1 +i))(ω - (1 -i))).
Which is Q(1 +i) * Q(1 -i), where Q(x) is the polynomial x^13 -1.
But Q(1 +i) is (1 +i)^13 -1 and Q(1 -i) is (1 -i)^13 -1.
Therefore, the product is [(1 +i)^13 -1] [ (1 -i)^13 -1 ].
Which is what we computed as 8321.
Therefore, the product in question is 8321, which modulo 1000 is 321.
Therefore, the answer is 321.
Hence, the final answer is \boxed{321}.
**Final Answer**
\boxed{321}

Answer: To solve the problem, we need to find the remainder when the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\) is divided by 1000, where \(\omega\) is a primitive 13th root of unity.

First, we recognize that \(\omega^k\) for \(k = 0, 1, \ldots, 12\) are all the 13th roots of unity. The term \(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\) can be rewritten as \((\omega^k - (1 + i))(\omega^k - (1 - i))\). Therefore, the product becomes:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1 + i)) \prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1 - i))
\]

This is equivalent to evaluating the polynomial \(x^{13} - 1\) at \(1 + i\) and \(1 - i\), subtracting 1 from each, and then taking the product:

\[
[(1 + i)^{13} - 1][(1 - i)^{13} - 1]
\]

Next, we compute \((1 + i)^{13}\) and \((1 - i)^{13}\). Using polar form, \(1 + i = \sqrt{2} e^{i\pi/4}\) and \(1 - i = \sqrt{2} e^{-i\pi/4}\). Raising these to the 13th power:

\[
(1 + i)^{13} = (\sqrt{2})^{13} e^{i \cdot 13\pi/4} = 2^{13/2} e^{i \cdot (5\pi/4)} = -2^{13/2} e^{i\pi/4}
\]

Similarly,

\[
(1 - i)^{13} = (\sqrt{2})^{13} e^{-i \cdot 13\pi/4} = 2^{13/2} e^{-i \cdot (5\pi/4)} = -2^{13/2} e^{-i\pi/4}
\]

Converting back to rectangular form, we find:

\[
(1 + i)^{13} = -64(1 + i) \quad \text{and} \quad (1 - i)^{13} = -64(1 - i)
\]

Subtracting 1 from each and forming the product:

\[
[ -64(1 + i) - 1 ][ -64(1 - i) - 1 ] = (-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i)
\]

This product is the modulus squared of \(-65 - 64i\):

\[
| -65 - 64i |^2 = 65^2 + 64^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321
\]

Finally, the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is:

\[
8321 \mod 1000 = 321
\]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{321}\).

okay, so i need to solve this problem where i have to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000.
here, ω is a 13th root of unity, not equal to 1.
alright, let's start breaking this down.
first, i remember that roots of unity are solutions to the equation x^n = 1.
so, for n=13, these are the complex numbers ω such that ω^13 = 1.
since ω ≠ 1, we're considering the primitive 13th roots of unity.
the polynomial equation they satisfy is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is φ_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1.
so, ω^k for k from 0 to 12 are all the roots, right?
but ω^0 is 1, and the problem states ω ≠ 1, but the product includes k=0.
 wait, ω^0 is 1, but when k=0, the term becomes (2 - 2*1 + 1^2) = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1.
so that term is 1.
but the problem says ω ≠ 1, but the product is over all k from 0 to 12, which includes ω^0 = 1.
hmm, maybe that's just the term when k=0.
wait, the problem says "let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity."
then, perhaps we are to consider ω as a primitive 13th root of unity, so ω^k for k from 0 to 12 gives all 13th roots of unity, including 1.
but since ω ≠ 1, maybe the product is over k where ω^k ≠ 1?
wait, no.
the product is from k=0 to 12, so it includes all 13 terms, but when k=0, ω^0=1, but the term becomes (2 - 2*1 + 1) = 1.
so the product is 1 multiplied by the other terms.
so, maybe even though ω ≠1, the product still includes that term.
wait, but maybe the problem is considering ω as a primitive root, so ω^k is never 1 for 1 ≤ k ≤ 12.
but in the product, when k=0, we have ω^0=1.
so, perhaps the product is from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}), so including that term when ω^k=1.
but in that case, when ω^k=1 (i.e., k=0), the term is (2 - 2*1 + 1) = 1, as above.
so, the product is 1 multiplied by the other terms.
so, perhaps the product can be written as 1 * π_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).
but then, since ω^k for k=1 to 12 are the primitive 13th roots of unity.
alternatively, maybe we can consider the product over all 13th roots of unity, but since the term for ω=1 is 1, the entire product is equal to the product over all 13th roots of unity of (2 - 2ω + ω^2).
wait, but if we include ω=1, then the product becomes π_{ω^13=1} (2 - 2ω + ω^2).
then, maybe we can evaluate this product.
let me think.
let me consider the polynomial p(x) = x^{13} - 1.
the roots are all the 13th roots of unity.
so, we can factor p(x) as π_{k=0}^{12} (x - ω^k).
but in our case, the product is π_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).
hmm, how can we relate this to the polynomial?
alternatively, maybe we can rewrite the term (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) as a polynomial in ω^k.
let me denote y = ω^k.
then, each term is (2 - 2y + y^2).
so, the product becomes π_{y^13=1} (2 - 2y + y^2).
so, we need to compute the product of (y^2 - 2y + 2) over all roots y of the equation y^13 = 1.
so, in other words, evaluate π_{y^13=1} (y^2 - 2y + 2).
so, how do we compute this product?
let me recall that for a polynomial q(y) whose roots are the 13th roots of unity, the product π_{y^13=1} (y^2 - 2y + 2) can be related to q(y) divided by some other term.
wait, perhaps we can use the fact that the product of (y - a_i) over all roots a_i is q(y).
so, if we have a polynomial r(y) = y^2 - 2y + 2, and we want to compute the product r(y) over all roots y of y^13 - 1.
alternatively, think of the product π_{y^13=1} (y^2 - 2y + 2).
this is equivalent to substituting each root y of x^{13} - 1 into the polynomial r(y) = y^2 - 2y + 2 and multiplying all those values together.
is there a way to compute this product without explicitly knowing the roots?
i remember that for a polynomial, the product of the values of a polynomial at the roots of another polynomial can be found using resultants or by using properties of polynomials.
alternatively, perhaps consider that the product π_{y^13=1} (r(y)) is equal to the resultant of the polynomials x^{13} - 1 and r(x).
wait, the resultant of two polynomials f and g is equal to the product of f(α) where α runs over the roots of g, times the leading coefficient of f raised to the degree of g.
but here, we have f(x) = x^{13} -1 and g(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2.
so, the resultant res(f, g) is equal to π_{α^13=1} g(α) times the leading coefficient of f raised to the degree of g.
but since the leading coefficient of f is 1, it's just π_{α^13=1} g(α).
so, the resultant of x^{13} -1 and x^2 - 2x + 2 is equal to our desired product.
therefore, if i can compute the resultant of these two polynomials, that would give me the product.
but how do i compute the resultant?
the resultant of two polynomials f and g can be computed as the determinant of the sylvester matrix, or using the euclidean algorithm.
let me recall that the resultant res(f, g) is equal to the determinant of the sylvester matrix, which is constructed by the coefficients of f and g.
but that might be tedious for degree 13 and 2.
alternatively, using the euclidean algorithm: the resultant is equal to (−1)^{deg f \cdot deg g} leading_coefficient^{\deg g - \deg r_1} \cdot r_1(0)^{\deg r_2} \cdot \ldots, but maybe that's not straightforward.
wait, perhaps another approach.
let me consider the polynomial q(x) = x^{13} - 1.
let’s think about how the product π_{y^13=1} (x^2 - 2x + 2) relates to q(x).
but actually, we need to evaluate the product at x = y, where y runs over the roots of q(x).
alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that the polynomial whose roots are the squares of the roots of q(x), or something else.
wait, perhaps factor the quadratic term.
let me look at x^2 - 2x + 2.
this factors as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).
so, the roots are 1 + i and 1 - i.
therefore, the product π_{y^13=1} (y^2 - 2y + 2) = π_{y^13=1} (y - (1 + i))(y - (1 -i)) = [π_{y^13=1} (y - (1 + i))] [π_{y^13=1} (y - (1 -i))].
so, this product is equal to q(1 + i) * q(1 - i), where q(x) = x^{13} - 1.
wait, but q(1 + i) is (1 + i)^{13} - 1 and q(1 - i) is (1 - i)^{13} -1.
therefore, the product is [(1 + i)^{13} -1][(1 - i)^13 -1].
so, maybe computing these two terms and multiplying them together will give the desired product.
then, we can compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.
let me recall that 1 + i and 1 - i can be expressed in polar form.
the modulus of 1 + i is sqrt(2), and its argument is π/4.
similarly, 1 - i has modulus sqrt(2) and argument -π/4.
therefore, (1 + i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{i * 13 * π/4}
similarly, (1 - i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{-i * 13 * π/4}
compute [sqrt(2)]^13.
sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so [2^{1/2}]^13 = 2^{13/2}.
therefore, (1 + i)^13 = 2^{13/2} * e^{i * 13π/4}
similarly for (1 - i)^13 = 2^{13/2} * e^{-i * 13π/4}
so, (1 + i)^13 -1 = 2^{13/2} * e^{i * (13π/4)} -1
similarly, (1 - i)^13 -1 = 2^{13/2} * e^{-i * (13π/4)} -1
therefore, the product [(1 + i)^13 -1][(1 -i)^13 -1] = [2^{13/2} e^{i 13π/4} -1][2^{13/2} e^{-i 13π/4} -1]
let me compute this product.
let me denote for simplicity z = 2^{13/2} e^{i 13π/4}.
then, the product is (z -1)(\overline{z} -1) = |z -1|^2.
because when you multiply (z - a)(\overline{z} - a), it's |z - a|^2, but here a =1.
wait, yes.
so, |z -1|^2.
therefore, the product is the modulus squared of z -1, where z = 2^{13/2} e^{i 13π/4}.
first, let's simplify the angle 13π/4.
since angles are modulo 2π, 13π/4 = (13π/4 - 3*2π) because 2π = 8π/4.
so, 3*2π = 6π = 24π/4.
wait, 13π/4 - 24π/4 = -11π/4.
alternatively, adding 8π/4 three times to 13π/4?
wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 13π/4 mod 2π.
13π/4 divided by 2π is (13π/4)/(2π) = 13/8 = 1.625.
so, 1 full rotation (2π) is 8π/4, so 13π/4 - 8π/4 = 5π/4.
therefore, 13π/4 is equivalent to 5π/4.
therefore, e^{i 13π/4} = e^{i 5π/4}.
so, e^{i 13π/4} = e^{i (π + π/4)} = -e^{i π/4}.
therefore, z = 2^{13/2} e^{i 5π/4} = 2^{13/2} * (-e^{i π/4}) = -2^{13/2} e^{i π/4}.
similarly, 2^{13/2} is 2^{6} * sqrt(2)} = 64 * sqrt(2).
but maybe let's keep it as 2^{13/2}.
therefore, z = -2^{13/2} e^{i π/4}
similarly, then z -1 = -2^{13/2} e^{i π/4} -1.
so, to compute |z -1|^2, we can write z -1 in terms of its real and imaginary parts.
first, e^{i π/4} = cos(π/4) + i sin(π/4) = √2/2 + i√2/2.
therefore, z = -2^{13/2} * (√2/2 + i√2/2) = -2^{13/2} * √2/2 (1 + i)
simplify 2^{13/2} * √2/2: 2^{13/2} = 2^{6 + 1/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * √2.
then, multiplying by √2/2 gives 64 * √2 * √2 /2 = 64 * 2 /2 = 64.
therefore, z = -64*(1 + i).
therefore, z -1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i.
therefore, |z -1|^2 = (-65)^2 + (-64)^2 = 65^2 + 64^2.
compute 65^2 = 4225, 64^2 = 4096.
so, 4225 + 4096 = 8321.
therefore, the product [(1 + i)^13 -1][(1 -i)^13 -1] = |z -1|^2 = 8321.
therefore, the product π_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) = 8321.
then, we need to find the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000.
so, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8*1000=8000, with remainder 321.
therefore, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.
so, the answer is 321.
but let me verify the steps again to make sure i didn't make a mistake.
first, i noticed that the product over all 13th roots of unity of (y^2 - 2y +2) is equal to the product of (1 + i) and (1 -i) substituted into x^{13} -1.
then, computed (1 + i)^13 and (1 -i)^13, each as 2^{13/2} e^{±i5π/4}, but then realized that 13π/4 is equivalent to 5π/4, but actually e^{i13π/4} = e^{i5π/4} since 13 mod 8 is 5, as each 2π is 8π/4.
then converting that to polar form, calculating modulus, etc.
then, converting z = 2^{13/2} e^{i5π/4} to rectangular form, simplified it to -64(1 + i).
then, subtracted 1 to get -65 -64i, computed the modulus squared as 65^2 +64^2 = 8321.
then, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.
that all checks out.
but let me double-check the calculation of z.
so, (1 + i)^13.
first, modulus is sqrt(2), raised to 13th power is (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2}.
angle is 13 * π/4.
as 13 * π/4 = 3π + π/4 (since 12π/4=3π, so 13π/4 - 3π = π/4), but 3π is equivalent to -π, so 13π/4 mod 2π is π/4 - 2π?
wait, no.
wait, 13π/4 is 3 full rotations (3*2π) plus 5π/4.
wait, 13π/4 = 3π + π/4.
but 3π is equivalent to π (since 2π is full rotation).
so, 3π + π/4 = π + π/4 = 5π/4.
so, yes, (1 + i)^13 = 2^{13/2} [cos(5π/4) + i sin(5π/4)] = 2^{13/2} (-√2/2 - i√2/2) = -2^{13/2} * √2/2 (1 + i) = -2^{7} (1 + i) = -128(1 + i).
wait, wait.
here's the mistake.
2^{13/2} is 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).
then, multiplying by sqrt(2)/2 gives 64 * sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)/2 = 64 * 2 /2 = 64.
so, that gives -64(1 + i).
wait, in my earlier calculation, i got -64(1 + i), but here you say 2^{13/2} is 64*sqrt(2), then times sqrt(2)/2 is 64*sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)/2 = 64*2/2 = 64.
so, indeed, z = -64(1 + i).
therefore, z -1 = -64(1 + i) -1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i.
therefore, modulus squared is (-65)^2 + (-64)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.
that's correct.
so, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.
therefore, the answer is 321.
wait, but before finalizing, let me check once more.
the product is from k=0 to 12, so includes k=0.
but when k=0, ω^0=1, so term is 2 - 2*1 +1 =1.
so, the product is 1 * rest of the terms.
however, the calculation above considered the product over all 13th roots of unity, which includes 1.
but when we evaluate q(1 + i) which is (1 + i)^13 -1 and q(1 -i) -1, then the product is (q(1 + i))(q(1 - i)) = [(1 +i)^13 -1] [ (1 -i)^13 -1 ].
but in our case, the product we want is π_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k})).
but 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} = ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2.
so, as a polynomial in ω^k, which is equal to (ω^k - (1 +i))(ω^k - (1 -i)).
therefore, the product over all k from 0 to 12 is π_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 +i))(ω^k - (1 -i))).
but since ω varies over all 13th roots of unity, this product becomes π_{ω^13=1} (ω - (1 +i))(ω - (1 -i))).
which is q(1 +i) * q(1 -i), where q(x) is the polynomial x^13 -1.
but q(1 +i) is (1 +i)^13 -1 and q(1 -i) is (1 -i)^13 -1.
therefore, the product is [(1 +i)^13 -1] [ (1 -i)^13 -1 ].
which is what we computed as 8321.
therefore, the product in question is 8321, which modulo 1000 is 321.
therefore, the answer is 321.
hence, the final answer is \boxed{321}.
**final answer**
\boxed{321}
</think>

answer: to solve the problem, we need to find the remainder when the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\) is divided by 1000, where \(\omega\) is a primitive 13th root of unity.

first, we recognize that \(\omega^k\) for \(k = 0, 1, \ldots, 12\) are all the 13th roots of unity. the term \(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\) can be rewritten as \((\omega^k - (1 + i))(\omega^k - (1 - i))\). therefore, the product becomes:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1 + i)) \prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1 - i))
\]

this is equivalent to evaluating the polynomial \(x^{13} - 1\) at \(1 + i\) and \(1 - i\), subtracting 1 from each, and then taking the product:

\[
[(1 + i)^{13} - 1][(1 - i)^{13} - 1]
\]

next, we compute \((1 + i)^{13}\) and \((1 - i)^{13}\). using polar form, \(1 + i = \sqrt{2} e^{i\pi/4}\) and \(1 - i = \sqrt{2} e^{-i\pi/4}\). raising these to the 13th power:

\[
(1 + i)^{13} = (\sqrt{2})^{13} e^{i \cdot 13\pi/4} = 2^{13/2} e^{i \cdot (5\pi/4)} = -2^{13/2} e^{i\pi/4}
\]

similarly,

\[
(1 - i)^{13} = (\sqrt{2})^{13} e^{-i \cdot 13\pi/4} = 2^{13/2} e^{-i \cdot (5\pi/4)} = -2^{13/2} e^{-i\pi/4}
\]

converting back to rectangular form, we find:

\[
(1 + i)^{13} = -64(1 + i) \quad \text{and} \quad (1 - i)^{13} = -64(1 - i)
\]

subtracting 1 from each and forming the product:

\[
[ -64(1 + i) - 1 ][ -64(1 - i) - 1 ] = (-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i)
\]

this product is the modulus squared of \(-65 - 64i\):

\[
| -65 - 64i |^2 = 65^2 + 64^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321
\]

finally, the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is:

\[
8321 \mod 1000 = 321
\]

thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{321}\)
