Okay, so I need to find the probability that a regular octagon, with each vertex colored either red or blue independently with equal probability, can be rotated such that all blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n. Alright, let's start breaking this down.
First, let's understand the problem statement again. Each vertex is colored red or blue with a 50-50 chance. Then, we need to check if there's some rotation (probably rotational symmetry of the octagon) such that if we rotate the octagon, all the vertices that are blue in the original coloring are rotated to positions where the original coloring had red vertices. In other words, after rotation, every blue vertex is moved to a position that was originally red. So, the rotated blue vertices don't overlap with the original blue vertices; they are all on red positions. That would mean that the set of blue vertices, when rotated by some multiple of 45 degrees (since it's an octagon), is disjoint from the original set of blue vertices. Then, the probability of such a coloring existing. Hmm, interesting.
So, the octagon has 8 vertices, labeled maybe 0 to 7. Each vertex is colored red or blue with probability 1/2 each. We need to compute the probability that there exists some rotation (rotational shift by k positions, where k divides 8?) such that after rotating the blue vertices by k positions, all those positions were originally red. So, equivalently, if we consider the set B of blue vertices, then there exists a k such that the rotated set B + k is completely contained in the set of red vertices, which is the complement of B. Since the octagon is regular, the rotations are by multiples of 45 degrees, i.e., rotating by 0, 1, 2, ..., 7 positions. So, we need that for some k (1 ≤ k ≤ 7), B + k ⊆ complement of B. Note that rotation by 0 would mean B ⊆ complement of B, which implies B is empty. But if we allow k=0, then even B empty would satisfy it, but maybe the problem says "can be rotated so that...", implying non-trivial rotation? Wait, the problem says "can be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices". So, the rotation has to be a non-zero rotation? Because if you rotate 0, then the positions are the same, so unless B is empty, it would overlap. But the problem says "each vertex is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability", so the case when B is empty has non-zero probability (1/256). Maybe k can be 0? Wait, but if k is 0, then we need B to be a subset of the complement of B, which would only be possible if B is empty. So, perhaps the problem allows k=0? But then in the problem statement, it says "rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices". If you rotate by 0, then "all of the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices" would mean that the current blue vertices are all red, i.e., B is empty. So, perhaps k=0 is allowed, in which case the event includes B being empty. But maybe the problem is considered as rotating the octagon, which maybe implies non-trivial rotation? Let me check the original problem again.
The problem says: "Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is m/n, where m and n are relatively prime positive integers. What is m + n?" So, "can be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices." So, the phrase "can be rotated" suggests that there exists some rotation (possibly including rotate by 0) such that after rotation, the blue vertices land on red ones. Then, as I thought earlier, if you allow rotation by 0, then that's only possible if B is empty. But if the rotation has to be non-zero, then even if B is empty, any rotation would work (since there are no blue vertices). Wait, but if B is empty, then regardless of rotation, the condition is satisfied because there are no blue vertices to check. So, actually, even if k=0 is allowed or not, the cases where B is empty would be counted. Wait, but if B is empty, then rotating by any k would result in blue vertices (of which there are none) being placed on red vertices. So, vacuously true. Therefore, the probability includes all cases where B is empty (1 case) and all non-empty B for which there exists a non-zero rotation k such that B rotated by k is a subset of the complement of B. Wait, but if k=0 is allowed, then B must be empty. So, including k=0 would not affect the other cases. But the problem statement says "can be rotated so that...", which might imply a non-trivial rotation, but maybe not. Let's check.
If the problem allowed k=0, then the probability would include all monochromatic colorings (all red, all blue). But wait, if k=0 is allowed, then for blue vertices to be placed on original red vertices, when rotating by 0, all blue vertices must be on red vertices, which is impossible unless B is empty. Wait, but if all vertices are blue, then rotating by 0, all blue vertices are on positions where originally there were blue vertices (since no rotation). Therefore, if k=0 is allowed, the only coloring that works is the all-red coloring (B empty). However, if k can be any rotation, including 0, then the probability would be 1/256 (the probability of all red). But that's probably not the case. But in the problem statement, it says "can be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices". If the octagon is rotated, even by 0, then "where there were originally red vertices" refers to the original coloring. So, if we rotate by 0, the positions are the same, so the blue vertices have to be on red positions, which is only possible if there are no blue vertices. So, the all-red coloring. But in the problem statement, it says "each vertex is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability", so the coloring is fixed, and we can choose to rotate it. So, after coloring, we can rotate the octagon (i.e., rotate the entire octagon, which cycles the vertices, and we check if in such a rotated position, all blue vertices coincide with red vertices in the original coloring. So, the original coloring is fixed; rotating the octagon is equivalent to permuting the vertices. So, if we consider the original coloring as a fixed coloring, then rotating the octagon by k positions and checking if the blue vertices in the rotated position coincide with red vertices in the original. So, the rotated blue vertices must be a subset of the red vertices in the original. So, that is, B rotated by k is a subset of the complement of B. So, the question is, what is the probability that there exists some k (0 ≤ k ≤7) such that R_k(B) ⊆ complement of B, where R_k is the rotation operator by k steps.
But here, if k=0, then R_0(B) = B, so we need B ⊆ complement of B, which implies B = empty set. Therefore, the only way k=0 works is if B is empty. But if k≥1, then even if B is non-empty, it might satisfy the condition.
Therefore, the total probability is the probability that either B is empty (so k=0 works) or there exists some k≥1 such that R_k(B) ⊆ complement of B. But B can be non-empty and still satisfy the condition for some k≥1.
Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the probability that the set B of blue vertices is "rotatable" into its complement. That is, B is a subset that can be rotated to be contained within the complement of B. So, such sets B are those which, when rotated by some k, fit into the red vertices. So, how can we approach calculating this probability?
Each coloring is equally likely, with probability 1/256. So, we need to count the number of colorings where there exists a rotation k (0 ≤k ≤7) such that rotating B by k results in a subset of the complement of B. Let's denote this as R_k(B) ⊆ Ā, where Ā is the complement of B (the set of red vertices). Since the octagon is regular, the group of rotations is cyclic of order 8, generated by rotation by one position. So, the possible rotations are R_0, R_1, ..., R_7. For each coloring B, we need to check if there exists a k such that R_k(B) ⊆ Ā. Note that if such a k exists, then B must be a subset of R_{-k}(Ā) = R_{8 -k}(Ā). Wait, maybe we can think in terms of complement. Since R_k(B) ⊆ Ā, then B ⊆ R_{-k}(Ā). So, for some k, B is a subset of the complement rotated by -k, which is equivalent to saying that B is contained in a rotation of the complement of B. So, in other words, there exists a rotation of the complement of B that contains B. Hmm. Let me think. Suppose we have a set B. Then, the condition is that there is some rotated copy of Ā that contains B. Alternatively, since rotating Ā is the same as rotating B (since Ā is the complement of B), maybe we can model this as B being fixed and rotated, or the complement being rotated. Let me be precise. If R_k(B) ⊆ Ā, then equivalently, for each vertex v in B, the vertex v + k (mod 8) is in Ā. So, all the vertices of B, when shifted by k, land in Ā. So, in other words, the shift of B by k is completely contained in Ā. Therefore, the question reduces to whether there exists a shift k such that B + k ⊆ Ā. Which is equivalent to saying that B and B + k are disjoint for some k. Wait, actually, since if B + k is a subset of Ā, then B and B + k are disjoint, because Ā is the complement of B. So, the condition is equivalent to the existence of a shift k such that B ∩ (B + k) = empty set. Wait, that's an interesting perspective. So, normally, a set B is called "cyclically independent" or something if there exists a shift k such that B and B +k are disjoint. Wait, but in general, even a non-empty set B can have a disjoint cyclic shift. For example, if B is a single vertex, then shifting by any k ≠0 would work. If B is two vertices separated by more than 4 vertices, maybe? Wait, but actually, in a cycle, the question of whether a set B has a cyclic shift that's disjoint from itself is non-trivial. This seems related to the concept of a cyclic difference set or something. But maybe there's a simpler way here.
Wait, but in our problem, B is an arbitrary subset of the 8 vertices, with each vertex chosen independently with probability 1/2. Then, the problem is to compute the probability that either B is empty (so k=0 works), or there exists some k≠0 such that B +k is contained in Ā, which is equivalent to B ∩ (B +k) = empty set for some k≠0. So, in other words, we need to compute the probability that the set B has a cyclic shift with which it is disjoint. Including the case where B is empty, which only works with k=0, but for non-empty sets, we need some k≠0.
So, the problem reduces to: What is the probability that a random subset of the 8-cycle has the property that there exists a shift k (possibly non-zero) such that shifting the subset by k results in a disjoint subset? But with the original problem's coloring, since each vertex is red or blue with probability 1/2, and we're looking at the set B of blue vertices. So, equivalently, the subsets of the 8-cycle where such a shift exists have probability mass summing to m/n.
But how do we compute this? Maybe we can model this using generating functions or Burnside's Lemma? Wait, Burnside's Lemma is used for counting orbits under group actions, but I need to compute the probability over all colorings. Alternatively, maybe using inclusion-exclusion. Hmm.
Alternatively, perhaps think of the problem as follows: For each coloring, we can check for each possible shift k whether B +k is contained in Ā. Then, the probability that there exists such a k is the probability that the maximum over k of [B +k ⊆ Ā] is 1. To compute this probability, maybe use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let me see.
Let’s denote for each shift k ∈ {0, 1, ..., 7}, the event A_k that B +k ⊆ Ā. Then, the probability we want is P(∪_{k=0}^7 A_k). By inclusion-exclusion, this is equal to the sum_{k} P(A_k) - sum_{k < l} P(A_k ∩ A_l) - ... + ... ± P(A_0 ∩ A_1 ∩ ... ∩ A_7). However, calculating this would require knowing the probabilities of the intersections, which might be complicated. But maybe there's a smarter way to compute these probabilities.
First, let's compute P(A_k) for a fixed k. What is the probability that B +k is a subset of Ā? Let's note that if k=0, then A_0 is the event that B ⊆ Ā, which is the same as B = empty set. So, P(A_0) = 1/256. For k ≠0, what is P(A_k)? For B +k ⊆ Ā, which is equivalent to B ∩ (B +k) = empty set. Wait, no. Wait, B +k ⊆ Ā is equivalent to for all x ∈ B, x -k (mod 8) ∈ Ā. Wait, maybe we need to be careful with direction. If B +k is shifted by k steps, then for each vertex in B, when shifted back by k, must be in Ā. Wait, perhaps it's easier to think of it as follows: For each vertex i, if i is in B, then (i -k) mod 8 must be in Ā. Wait, if B +k ⊆ Ā, then for every vertex j in B +k, j ∈ Ā. Since B +k = { (i +k) mod 8 | i ∈ B }, so for each i ∈ B, (i +k) mod 8 ∈ Ā. Therefore, B +k ⊆ Ā is equivalent to the condition that for every i ∈ B, the vertex (i +k) mod 8 is in Ā. But since Ā is the complement of B, this means that for all i ∈ B, (i +k) mod 8 ∉ B. So, there are no two vertices i, j in B such that j = i +k mod 8. Therefore, for a fixed k ≠0, the event A_k is that there are no two vertices in B that are k-apart. So, for a fixed k, the probability that no two vertices in B are k apart. Then, P(A_k) is equal to the probability that in the coloring, there are no two vertices i and i +k mod 8 both colored blue. Now, for k from 1 to 7, but note that shifts k and 8 -k are equivalent in a cycle of length 8. For example, shifting by 1 or 7, shifting by 2 or 6, etc., because shifting by k or by 8 -k gives the same pair of opposite relations. However, in an octagon, for k=4, shifting by 4 is the same as shifting by 4 in the other direction since 8 -4 =4. So, the shift pairs are (1,7), (2,6), (3,5), and 4.
Therefore, for k=1 and k=7, they are equivalent in terms of pairs of vertices. Similarly, k=2 and 6, k=3 and 5. For k=4, it's self-paired. So, maybe the probabilities for A_k will be the same for k and 8 -k. Therefore, for k=1 and 7, same probability, for k=2 and 6, etc.
But perhaps first, let's compute P(A_k) for a fixed k. Let's take k=1. Then, P(A_1) is the probability that no two adjacent vertices are both blue. That's a classic problem in combinatorics: the number of colorings with no two adjacent vertices the same color... Wait, but not exactly. Here, it's the number of colorings where no two adjacent vertices are both blue. So, it's like the graph being colored with two colors, with the restriction that no two blue vertices are adjacent. The number of such colorings is known for cycles. In fact, the problem of counting the number of independent sets in a cycle graph.
Wait, yes, exactly. For a cycle graph C_n, the number of independent sets (sets of vertices where no two are adjacent) is given by a specific formula. But here, we can have any subset of vertices colored blue such that no two are adjacent. So, for k=1, A_1 is the event that B is an independent set in the cycle graph C_8. The number of such B is given by the recurrence relation for independent sets. The number of independent sets in a cycle graph C_n is known to be J(n) = 2 \times J(n-1) + (-1)^n, with J(1)=1, J(2)=2. Wait, but maybe that's not the exact formula. Alternatively, the number of independent sets in a cycle graph C_n is F_{n+1} for n ≥1, where F_n is the Fibonacci number, but I need to recall. Wait, actually, the number of independent sets (including the empty set) in a cycle graph C_n is given by a formula involving Fibonacci numbers of the Lucas sequence? Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me think.
Alternatively, for a path graph P_n, the number of independent sets is indeed F_{n+2}. But for a cycle graph C_n, it's more complicated. Wait, for a cycle graph C_n, the number of independent sets is given by 2^n times (1 - (-1)^n)/n multiplied by something? Wait, maybe not. Let's check for small n. For n=3: a triangle. The independent sets are the empty set, each individual vertex (3), and the three pairs. Wait, no. In a triangle, the independent sets are the empty set, each single vertex (3), and no pairs since each pair is adjacent. So, total 4 independent sets. But according to the formula for cycle graphs, the number is supposed to be 4. Wait, but for n=3, 4. For n=4, a cycle of 4 nodes. The independent sets are: empty set, 4 singletons, 2 pairs of opposite vertices, and nothing else (since adjacent pairs are forbidden). So total 1 + 4 + 2 = 7. But 7 independent sets. Wait, but according to the formula for the number of independent sets in C_4, is that 7? Let me list them: {}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, {1,3}, {2,4}. Yes, 7. So, 7. But how does this generalize? The number seems to follow the recurrence J(n) = J(n-1) + J(n-2) - J(n-3). Wait, maybe. But for n=3, J(3)=4, J(4)=7, J(5)= J(4)+J(3)-J(2)=7+4-2=9? Wait, but for C_5, the number of independent sets is 1, 5 singletons, 5 pairs, 5 trios? Wait, no. For a cycle of 5 nodes, the independent sets are: empty set, 5 singletons, 5 pairs (non-adjacent), and 5 trios? Wait, perhaps no. Let's think again. In any case, this might not be the right approach, since calculating the exact number of independent sets for C_8 is non-trivial, and perhaps beyond the scope here. Alternatively, maybe there's a better way. Wait, actually, the problem isn't just for k=1. For general k, the event A_k is that no two vertices separated by k positions are both blue. So, for each chord of distance k in the octagon, the two endpoints cannot both be blue. So, the graph where edges connect vertices distance k apart, and we need an independent set in that graph. But when k=1, it's the original cycle. When k=2, edges are two apart, like every other vertex, etc. But for multiple k's, overlapping graphs. So, the events A_k for different k's are not independent. Thus, inclusion-exclusion might get complicated. But perhaps the problem does not require us to go through the entire inclusion-exclusion, but instead uses some symmetry orBurnside's approach. Alternatively, note that the total probability we need is the probability that B is either empty or has a non-zero shift k where B +k ⊆ Ā. But perhaps the key is to note that for each non-empty set B, the number of such B that can be rotated into their complement is related to the number of fixed points under some group action. Maybe Burnside's Lemma can help here. Wait, Burnside's Lemma is used for counting orbits. Let's see. Suppose we have the dihedral group D_8 acting on the octagon, but in this case, perhaps the cyclic subgroup of rotations. The problem is that we have colorings where there exists a rotation that maps B to a subset of Ā. Alternatively, thinking in terms of fixed points: For a random coloring, what is the probability that some rotation maps B into Ā. So, for the cyclic group generated by rotation, we can model this as the probability that the coloring has a non-trivial rotation symmetry (but not exactly symmetry, but a rotation that maps into the complement). Wait, but maybe if we model the coloring as two colors, then the rotation should map the color blue to red. That is, if we consider the coloring as an element of the product space {red, blue}^8, then we can consider the rotation operator ρ^k which shifts the colors by k positions. Then, the condition is that there exists k such that ρ^k(B) ⊆ Ā. So, for each position i, if ρ^k(B)_i = blue, then Ā_i = blue. Wait, not exactly. Let me clarify. If we rotate the coloring B by k positions, then the new coloring ρ^k(B) must be a subset of Ā. So, in other words, for all i, if (ρ^k(B))_i = blue, then Ā_i = blue. But Ā is the original complement. So, it's equivalent to saying that the rotated coloring ρ^k(B) is a subset of Ā. Therefore, the colorings where such a k exists. Alternatively, since each coloring is equally likely, the probability is the number of such colorings divided by 256. So, perhaps we can compute the numerator as follows. Let's consider that for each coloring, there exists a k such that rotating B by k positions gives a subset of Ā. So, for each coloring, we need to check if there exists a k where for all i, if the vertex (i -k) mod 8 is blue, then the vertex i is red. Wait, perhaps another angle. Let's consider that each vertex i has a set of "forbidden" colors based on the requirement. But this seems complicated. Alternatively, note that if we fix k, then the condition is that B and ρ^k(B) are disjoint. Wait, but ρ^k(B) is the rotated set. So, if we consider B and its rotation by k, they must be disjoint. So, the problem reduces to: For a random subset B of the 8 vertices, what is the probability that there exists a k (0 ≤k ≤7) such that B and ρ^k(B) are disjoint? With the understanding that for k=0, this is only possible if B is empty. For k≠0, it's possible for non-empty B. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to computing the probability that a random subset of the 8-cycle has a cyclic shift with which it is disjoint. Including the case where B is empty, which only works with k=0, but for non-empty sets, we need some k≠0. So, this seems like we can model this as follows: For each subset B of the 8 vertices, let S(B) be the set of shifts k where B and ρ^k(B) are disjoint. Then, we need to compute the probability that S(B) is non-empty. So, the total number of subsets B where there exists some k with B ∩ ρ^k(B) = ∅, divided by 2^8. So, the question is, how many subsets of the 8-cycle have at least one cyclic shift that is disjoint from them. So, the complement of the number of subsets that have no cyclic shift disjoint from them. Therefore, perhaps using inclusion-exclusion over the shifts? Wait, but inclusion-exclusion over all subsets would be complicated. Alternatively, note that the total number of subsets with the required property is equal to the sum over k=0 to 7 of the number of subsets B where k is in S(B)), but since different subsets may have different shifts, this is not straightforward. Wait, but maybe using Möbius inversion for cyclic groups? Alternatively, perhaps there's a generating function approach. Alternatively, think of each vertex and its image under rotations. For each vertex i, consider the positions i, i+1, ..., i+7. But this seems messy. Wait, another approach: Each vertex can be in a "conflict" with its images under rotations. For each vertex i and shift k, j = i +k. If i is blue, then j must be red. But if j is blue, then we have a conflict unless there's a k where this doesn't happen. Wait, but this seems like a system of constraints. Each blue vertex i imposes that i +k must be red. But for different i, these constraints might interact. So, if we have two blue vertices i and j, then for their constraints not to interfere, we need that i +k and j +k are both red. So, in particular, if i and j are separated by m positions, then (i +k) and (j +k) are separated by m positions. Therefore, the conflicts can be modeled as a graph where each blue vertex is connected to its forbidden red vertices? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps model this as a graph coloring problem. Each vertex has to be colored red or blue, with the constraint that for some shift k, all blue vertices shifted by k are red. So, the problem is to count the number of such colorings. Alternatively, for each possible shift k, the number of colorings where shifting B by k results in Ā, but this is different. Wait, but the problem doesn't require that all blue vertices shifted by k give red vertices; just that there exists a k where this holds. So, it's an existential quantifier over k. Therefore, the total number of such colorings is the sum over k of the number of colorings where B shifted by k is a subset of Ā, minus the overlaps where colorings satisfy multiple k's. But this is again inclusion-exclusion. So, to compute the number of colorings that satisfy the condition for at least one k, we need to compute: Sum_{k=0}^7 |A_k| - Sum_{0 ≤k < l ≤7} |A_k ∩ A_l| + ... + (-1)^{t} |A_{k_1} ∩ ... ∩ A_{k_t}}| ... + |A_0 ∩ ... ∩ A_7|. Where |A_k| is the number of colorings where shifting B by k results in a subset of Ā. So, first, let's compute |A_k|. For k=0, |A_0| = 1, since only the all-red coloring. For k ≠0, |A_k| is the number of colorings where for all i ∈ B, i +k is in Ā. That is, if a vertex is blue, then the vertex k steps ahead is red. So, how many such colorings are there? Let's model this as a graph where each vertex is either red or blue, with the constraint that for each vertex i, if i is blue, then i +k is red. This is similar to a constraint satisfaction problem. For a fixed k, this is equivalent to a graph with vertices connected by edges (i, i +k), where each edge must not have both endpoints blue. So, the number of colorings is the number of colorings where no two vertices i and i +k are both blue. So, for each shift k, the number of such colorings is equal to the number of independent sets in the graph where edges connect each vertex to its k-th neighbor. But since the octagon is a cycle, this is a circulant graph. For k=1, it's the cycle graph. For other k's, it's a cycle graph with different jumps. However, computing the number of independent sets in such graphs is non-trivial. Alternatively, we can model this as a product of variables. For each vertex i, let x_i be a variable indicating whether it's blue (1) or not (0). Then, the constraints are that x_i + x_{i +k} ≤1 for all i. So, the number of colorings is the number of solutions to these inequalities. The generating function for such colorings is known for some graphs. For example, when k=1, this is the standard problem of counting the number of independent sets in a cycle graph, which is where the recurrence comes in. For C_n, the number of independent sets is F_{n+1} where F_n is the Fibonacci sequence. Wait, but for n=3, that would be F_4=3, but we have 4 independent sets. So, perhaps different. Wait, in the cycle graph C_n, the number of independent sets is given by a recurrence. Let me check. Let’s denote a_n = number of independent sets in C_n. For a path P_n, the number of independent sets is F_{n+2}. For the cycle graph C_n, the number is F_{n+2} - F_n = F_{n+1} + F_{n-1} - F_n = F_{n+1} - F_{n-1}. Wait, but that's not right. Let me think again. Alternatively, for the cycle graph C_n, the number of independent sets is F_{n} + 1? Wait, not sure. Maybe I need to calculate for small n. For n=1: 2 independent sets (color it red or blue). For n=2: Cycle of two vertices. Each has the constraint that they can't both be blue. So, the independent sets are: {}, {1}, {2}. So, 3. Which is 2^2 -1=3. So, in general, for C_n, the number of independent sets is 2^n - number of colorings where at least one pair of adjacent vertices are both blue. But that's not straightforward. Alternatively, for the cycle graph C_n, the number of independent sets is given by the recursion a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} - a_{n-3}. For example: a(1) =2, a(2)=3, a(3)=4, a(4)=7, a(5)=11, etc. Wait, but this seems similar to the recurrence for the number of necklaces. However, perhaps not. Alternatively, let me consider for k=1, the number of colorings where no two adjacent vertices are both blue. For a cycle graph C_8, the number of such colorings is given by the formula: Let’s denote a_n = number of independent sets in C_n. Then, the recurrence is a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} - a_{n-3}. But I need to verify. For n=3, a_3 = 4. Let's compute a_3: C_3. The independent sets are {}, {1}, {2}, {3}, so 4. Wait, but according to the formula a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} - a_{n-3}}, a_3 would be a_2 + a_1 - a_0 = 3 + 2 -1=4. But a_0 is 1. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the formula for the number of independent sets in C_n is 2 \times Fibonacci(n +1) - 2. Not sure. Alternatively, let's look up the sequence. For n=3:4; n=4:7; n=5:11; n=6:18; n=7:29; n=8:47. Wait, these numbers correspond to something else. Let me check the actual values. For a cycle graph C_n, the number of independent sets (including the empty set) is given by the recurrence a(n) = a(n-1) + a(n-2) - a(n-4) - a(n-5) + a(n-6) + ... This seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps use generating functions. Wait, but maybe for k=1, the number of colorings is a(n) = 2a(n-1) - a(n-2) + a(0). Not sure. Wait, maybe not. Let me consider that for each vertex, coloring it blue fixes the color of the vertex k steps ahead to red. So, for k=1, if we color vertex 1 blue, then vertex 2 must be red, then vertex 3 can be either color, etc. But this is similar to a linear recurrence. Wait, for a linear chain, the number of such colorings is indeed a linear recurrence. For a cycle, it's more complex. Alternatively, for k=1, the number of colorings is equal to the (8-th Fibonacci number) but no, not exactly. Let me compute for n=8. If it's a cycle graph C_8, the number of independent sets is 47, according to some references. But that would mean that |A_1| =47. But 47 is a prime number. Then, the total number of colorings for k=1 would be 47. Similarly, for k=2, which is a graph where edges connect vertices two apart. What is the number of independent sets in that graph? For example, for k=2, the graph is a 2-factor: two disjoint 4-cycles. So, the cycle graph C_8 with edges between vertices two apart is actually two separate 4-cycles. Therefore, the number of independent sets in this graph is (number of independent sets in C_4)^2. For C_4, the number of independent sets is 7. Therefore, (7)^2=49. Therefore, for k=2, |A_2|=49. Similarly, for k=4, the graph is four disjoint edges. The number of independent sets for each edge is 3 (red-red, red-blue, blue-red), but since they are disjoint edges, the total is 3^4=81. Wait, but no. For k=4, each edge is a pair of diametrically opposite vertices. So, each such edge is just two vertices antipodal, and the independent sets would be those where not both are blue. But for four such pairs, the total number of colorings where no two vertices distance 4 apart are both blue is 2^4 * (1 +1) = 16*2=32? Wait,

solve the following math problem: each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. the probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. what is $m+n$?

okay, so i need to find the probability that a regular octagon, with each vertex colored either red or blue independently with equal probability, can be rotated such that all blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. the answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n. alright, let's start breaking this down.
first, let's understand the problem statement again. each vertex is colored red or blue with a 50-50 chance. then, we need to check if there's some rotation (probably rotational symmetry of the octagon) such that if we rotate the octagon, all the vertices that are blue in the original coloring are rotated to positions where the original coloring had red vertices. in other words, after rotation, every blue vertex is moved to a position that was originally red. so, the rotated blue vertices don't overlap with the original blue vertices; they are all on red positions. that would mean that the set of blue vertices, when rotated by some multiple of 45 degrees (since it's an octagon), is disjoint from the original set of blue vertices. then, the probability of such a coloring existing. hmm, interesting.
so, the octagon has 8 vertices, labeled maybe 0 to 7. each vertex is colored red or blue with probability 1/2 each. we need to compute the probability that there exists some rotation (rotational shift by k positions, where k divides 8?) such that after rotating the blue vertices by k positions, all those positions were originally red. so, equivalently, if we consider the set b of blue vertices, then there exists a k such that the rotated set b + k is completely contained in the set of red vertices, which is the complement of b. since the octagon is regular, the rotations are by multiples of 45 degrees, i.e., rotating by 0, 1, 2, ..., 7 positions. so, we need that for some k (1 ≤ k ≤ 7), b + k ⊆ complement of b. note that rotation by 0 would mean b ⊆ complement of b, which implies b is empty. but if we allow k=0, then even b empty would satisfy it, but maybe the problem says "can be rotated so that...", implying non-trivial rotation? wait, the problem says "can be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices". so, the rotation has to be a non-zero rotation? because if you rotate 0, then the positions are the same, so unless b is empty, it would overlap. but the problem says "each vertex is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability", so the case when b is empty has non-zero probability (1/256). maybe k can be 0? wait, but if k is 0, then we need b to be a subset of the complement of b, which would only be possible if b is empty. so, perhaps the problem allows k=0? but then in the problem statement, it says "rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices". if you rotate by 0, then "all of the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices" would mean that the current blue vertices are all red, i.e., b is empty. so, perhaps k=0 is allowed, in which case the event includes b being empty. but maybe the problem is considered as rotating the octagon, which maybe implies non-trivial rotation? let me check the original problem again.
the problem says: "each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. the probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is m/n, where m and n are relatively prime positive integers. what is m + n?" so, "can be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices." so, the phrase "can be rotated" suggests that there exists some rotation (possibly including rotate by 0) such that after rotation, the blue vertices land on red ones. then, as i thought earlier, if you allow rotation by 0, then that's only possible if b is empty. but if the rotation has to be non-zero, then even if b is empty, any rotation would work (since there are no blue vertices). wait, but if b is empty, then regardless of rotation, the condition is satisfied because there are no blue vertices to check. so, actually, even if k=0 is allowed or not, the cases where b is empty would be counted. wait, but if b is empty, then rotating by any k would result in blue vertices (of which there are none) being placed on red vertices. so, vacuously true. therefore, the probability includes all cases where b is empty (1 case) and all non-empty b for which there exists a non-zero rotation k such that b rotated by k is a subset of the complement of b. wait, but if k=0 is allowed, then b must be empty. so, including k=0 would not affect the other cases. but the problem statement says "can be rotated so that...", which might imply a non-trivial rotation, but maybe not. let's check.
if the problem allowed k=0, then the probability would include all monochromatic colorings (all red, all blue). but wait, if k=0 is allowed, then for blue vertices to be placed on original red vertices, when rotating by 0, all blue vertices must be on red vertices, which is impossible unless b is empty. wait, but if all vertices are blue, then rotating by 0, all blue vertices are on positions where originally there were blue vertices (since no rotation). therefore, if k=0 is allowed, the only coloring that works is the all-red coloring (b empty). however, if k can be any rotation, including 0, then the probability would be 1/256 (the probability of all red). but that's probably not the case. but in the problem statement, it says "can be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices". if the octagon is rotated, even by 0, then "where there were originally red vertices" refers to the original coloring. so, if we rotate by 0, the positions are the same, so the blue vertices have to be on red positions, which is only possible if there are no blue vertices. so, the all-red coloring. but in the problem statement, it says "each vertex is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability", so the coloring is fixed, and we can choose to rotate it. so, after coloring, we can rotate the octagon (i.e., rotate the entire octagon, which cycles the vertices, and we check if in such a rotated position, all blue vertices coincide with red vertices in the original coloring. so, the original coloring is fixed; rotating the octagon is equivalent to permuting the vertices. so, if we consider the original coloring as a fixed coloring, then rotating the octagon by k positions and checking if the blue vertices in the rotated position coincide with red vertices in the original. so, the rotated blue vertices must be a subset of the red vertices in the original. so, that is, b rotated by k is a subset of the complement of b. so, the question is, what is the probability that there exists some k (0 ≤ k ≤7) such that r_k(b) ⊆ complement of b, where r_k is the rotation operator by k steps.
but here, if k=0, then r_0(b) = b, so we need b ⊆ complement of b, which implies b = empty set. therefore, the only way k=0 works is if b is empty. but if k≥1, then even if b is non-empty, it might satisfy the condition.
therefore, the total probability is the probability that either b is empty (so k=0 works) or there exists some k≥1 such that r_k(b) ⊆ complement of b. but b can be non-empty and still satisfy the condition for some k≥1.
therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the probability that the set b of blue vertices is "rotatable" into its complement. that is, b is a subset that can be rotated to be contained within the complement of b. so, such sets b are those which, when rotated by some k, fit into the red vertices. so, how can we approach calculating this probability?
each coloring is equally likely, with probability 1/256. so, we need to count the number of colorings where there exists a rotation k (0 ≤k ≤7) such that rotating b by k results in a subset of the complement of b. let's denote this as r_k(b) ⊆ ā, where ā is the complement of b (the set of red vertices). since the octagon is regular, the group of rotations is cyclic of order 8, generated by rotation by one position. so, the possible rotations are r_0, r_1, ..., r_7. for each coloring b, we need to check if there exists a k such that r_k(b) ⊆ ā. note that if such a k exists, then b must be a subset of r_{-k}(ā) = r_{8 -k}(ā). wait, maybe we can think in terms of complement. since r_k(b) ⊆ ā, then b ⊆ r_{-k}(ā). so, for some k, b is a subset of the complement rotated by -k, which is equivalent to saying that b is contained in a rotation of the complement of b. so, in other words, there exists a rotation of the complement of b that contains b. hmm. let me think. suppose we have a set b. then, the condition is that there is some rotated copy of ā that contains b. alternatively, since rotating ā is the same as rotating b (since ā is the complement of b), maybe we can model this as b being fixed and rotated, or the complement being rotated. let me be precise. if r_k(b) ⊆ ā, then equivalently, for each vertex v in b, the vertex v + k (mod 8) is in ā. so, all the vertices of b, when shifted by k, land in ā. so, in other words, the shift of b by k is completely contained in ā. therefore, the question reduces to whether there exists a shift k such that b + k ⊆ ā. which is equivalent to saying that b and b + k are disjoint for some k. wait, actually, since if b + k is a subset of ā, then b and b + k are disjoint, because ā is the complement of b. so, the condition is equivalent to the existence of a shift k such that b ∩ (b + k) = empty set. wait, that's an interesting perspective. so, normally, a set b is called "cyclically independent" or something if there exists a shift k such that b and b +k are disjoint. wait, but in general, even a non-empty set b can have a disjoint cyclic shift. for example, if b is a single vertex, then shifting by any k ≠0 would work. if b is two vertices separated by more than 4 vertices, maybe? wait, but actually, in a cycle, the question of whether a set b has a cyclic shift that's disjoint from itself is non-trivial. this seems related to the concept of a cyclic difference set or something. but maybe there's a simpler way here.
wait, but in our problem, b is an arbitrary subset of the 8 vertices, with each vertex chosen independently with probability 1/2. then, the problem is to compute the probability that either b is empty (so k=0 works), or there exists some k≠0 such that b +k is contained in ā, which is equivalent to b ∩ (b +k) = empty set for some k≠0. so, in other words, we need to compute the probability that the set b has a cyclic shift with which it is disjoint. including the case where b is empty, which only works with k=0, but for non-empty sets, we need some k≠0.
so, the problem reduces to: what is the probability that a random subset of the 8-cycle has the property that there exists a shift k (possibly non-zero) such that shifting the subset by k results in a disjoint subset? but with the original problem's coloring, since each vertex is red or blue with probability 1/2, and we're looking at the set b of blue vertices. so, equivalently, the subsets of the 8-cycle where such a shift exists have probability mass summing to m/n.
but how do we compute this? maybe we can model this using generating functions or burnside's lemma? wait, burnside's lemma is used for counting orbits under group actions, but i need to compute the probability over all colorings. alternatively, maybe using inclusion-exclusion. hmm.
alternatively, perhaps think of the problem as follows: for each coloring, we can check for each possible shift k whether b +k is contained in ā. then, the probability that there exists such a k is the probability that the maximum over k of [b +k ⊆ ā] is 1. to compute this probability, maybe use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. let me see.
let’s denote for each shift k ∈ {0, 1, ..., 7}, the event a_k that b +k ⊆ ā. then, the probability we want is p(∪_{k=0}^7 a_k). by inclusion-exclusion, this is equal to the sum_{k} p(a_k) - sum_{k < l} p(a_k ∩ a_l) - ... + ... ± p(a_0 ∩ a_1 ∩ ... ∩ a_7). however, calculating this would require knowing the probabilities of the intersections, which might be complicated. but maybe there's a smarter way to compute these probabilities.
first, let's compute p(a_k) for a fixed k. what is the probability that b +k is a subset of ā? let's note that if k=0, then a_0 is the event that b ⊆ ā, which is the same as b = empty set. so, p(a_0) = 1/256. for k ≠0, what is p(a_k)? for b +k ⊆ ā, which is equivalent to b ∩ (b +k) = empty set. wait, no. wait, b +k ⊆ ā is equivalent to for all x ∈ b, x -k (mod 8) ∈ ā. wait, maybe we need to be careful with direction. if b +k is shifted by k steps, then for each vertex in b, when shifted back by k, must be in ā. wait, perhaps it's easier to think of it as follows: for each vertex i, if i is in b, then (i -k) mod 8 must be in ā. wait, if b +k ⊆ ā, then for every vertex j in b +k, j ∈ ā. since b +k = { (i +k) mod 8 | i ∈ b }, so for each i ∈ b, (i +k) mod 8 ∈ ā. therefore, b +k ⊆ ā is equivalent to the condition that for every i ∈ b, the vertex (i +k) mod 8 is in ā. but since ā is the complement of b, this means that for all i ∈ b, (i +k) mod 8 ∉ b. so, there are no two vertices i, j in b such that j = i +k mod 8. therefore, for a fixed k ≠0, the event a_k is that there are no two vertices in b that are k-apart. so, for a fixed k, the probability that no two vertices in b are k apart. then, p(a_k) is equal to the probability that in the coloring, there are no two vertices i and i +k mod 8 both colored blue. now, for k from 1 to 7, but note that shifts k and 8 -k are equivalent in a cycle of length 8. for example, shifting by 1 or 7, shifting by 2 or 6, etc., because shifting by k or by 8 -k gives the same pair of opposite relations. however, in an octagon, for k=4, shifting by 4 is the same as shifting by 4 in the other direction since 8 -4 =4. so, the shift pairs are (1,7), (2,6), (3,5), and 4.
therefore, for k=1 and k=7, they are equivalent in terms of pairs of vertices. similarly, k=2 and 6, k=3 and 5. for k=4, it's self-paired. so, maybe the probabilities for a_k will be the same for k and 8 -k. therefore, for k=1 and 7, same probability, for k=2 and 6, etc.
but perhaps first, let's compute p(a_k) for a fixed k. let's take k=1. then, p(a_1) is the probability that no two adjacent vertices are both blue. that's a classic problem in combinatorics: the number of colorings with no two adjacent vertices the same color... wait, but not exactly. here, it's the number of colorings where no two adjacent vertices are both blue. so, it's like the graph being colored with two colors, with the restriction that no two blue vertices are adjacent. the number of such colorings is known for cycles. in fact, the problem of counting the number of independent sets in a cycle graph.
wait, yes, exactly. for a cycle graph c_n, the number of independent sets (sets of vertices where no two are adjacent) is given by a specific formula. but here, we can have any subset of vertices colored blue such that no two are adjacent. so, for k=1, a_1 is the event that b is an independent set in the cycle graph c_8. the number of such b is given by the recurrence relation for independent sets. the number of independent sets in a cycle graph c_n is known to be j(n) = 2 \times j(n-1) + (-1)^n, with j(1)=1, j(2)=2. wait, but maybe that's not the exact formula. alternatively, the number of independent sets in a cycle graph c_n is f_{n+1} for n ≥1, where f_n is the fibonacci number, but i need to recall. wait, actually, the number of independent sets (including the empty set) in a cycle graph c_n is given by a formula involving fibonacci numbers of the lucas sequence? wait, maybe not exactly. let me think.
alternatively, for a path graph p_n, the number of independent sets is indeed f_{n+2}. but for a cycle graph c_n, it's more complicated. wait, for a cycle graph c_n, the number of independent sets is given by 2^n times (1 - (-1)^n)/n multiplied by something? wait, maybe not. let's check for small n. for n=3: a triangle. the independent sets are the empty set, each individual vertex (3), and the three pairs. wait, no. in a triangle, the independent sets are the empty set, each single vertex (3), and no pairs since each pair is adjacent. so, total 4 independent sets. but according to the formula for cycle graphs, the number is supposed to be 4. wait, but for n=3, 4. for n=4, a cycle of 4 nodes. the independent sets are: empty set, 4 singletons, 2 pairs of opposite vertices, and nothing else (since adjacent pairs are forbidden). so total 1 + 4 + 2 = 7. but 7 independent sets. wait, but according to the formula for the number of independent sets in c_4, is that 7? let me list them: {}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, {1,3}, {2,4}. yes, 7. so, 7. but how does this generalize? the number seems to follow the recurrence j(n) = j(n-1) + j(n-2) - j(n-3). wait, maybe. but for n=3, j(3)=4, j(4)=7, j(5)= j(4)+j(3)-j(2)=7+4-2=9? wait, but for c_5, the number of independent sets is 1, 5 singletons, 5 pairs, 5 trios? wait, no. for a cycle of 5 nodes, the independent sets are: empty set, 5 singletons, 5 pairs (non-adjacent), and 5 trios? wait, perhaps no. let's think again. in any case, this might not be the right approach, since calculating the exact number of independent sets for c_8 is non-trivial, and perhaps beyond the scope here. alternatively, maybe there's a better way. wait, actually, the problem isn't just for k=1. for general k, the event a_k is that no two vertices separated by k positions are both blue. so, for each chord of distance k in the octagon, the two endpoints cannot both be blue. so, the graph where edges connect vertices distance k apart, and we need an independent set in that graph. but when k=1, it's the original cycle. when k=2, edges are two apart, like every other vertex, etc. but for multiple k's, overlapping graphs. so, the events a_k for different k's are not independent. thus, inclusion-exclusion might get complicated. but perhaps the problem does not require us to go through the entire inclusion-exclusion, but instead uses some symmetry orburnside's approach. alternatively, note that the total probability we need is the probability that b is either empty or has a non-zero shift k where b +k ⊆ ā. but perhaps the key is to note that for each non-empty set b, the number of such b that can be rotated into their complement is related to the number of fixed points under some group action. maybe burnside's lemma can help here. wait, burnside's lemma is used for counting orbits. let's see. suppose we have the dihedral group d_8 acting on the octagon, but in this case, perhaps the cyclic subgroup of rotations. the problem is that we have colorings where there exists a rotation that maps b to a subset of ā. alternatively, thinking in terms of fixed points: for a random coloring, what is the probability that some rotation maps b into ā. so, for the cyclic group generated by rotation, we can model this as the probability that the coloring has a non-trivial rotation symmetry (but not exactly symmetry, but a rotation that maps into the complement). wait, but maybe if we model the coloring as two colors, then the rotation should map the color blue to red. that is, if we consider the coloring as an element of the product space {red, blue}^8, then we can consider the rotation operator ρ^k which shifts the colors by k positions. then, the condition is that there exists k such that ρ^k(b) ⊆ ā. so, for each position i, if ρ^k(b)_i = blue, then ā_i = blue. wait, not exactly. let me clarify. if we rotate the coloring b by k positions, then the new coloring ρ^k(b) must be a subset of ā. so, in other words, for all i, if (ρ^k(b))_i = blue, then ā_i = blue. but ā is the original complement. so, it's equivalent to saying that the rotated coloring ρ^k(b) is a subset of ā. therefore, the colorings where such a k exists. alternatively, since each coloring is equally likely, the probability is the number of such colorings divided by 256. so, perhaps we can compute the numerator as follows. let's consider that for each coloring, there exists a k such that rotating b by k positions gives a subset of ā. so, for each coloring, we need to check if there exists a k where for all i, if the vertex (i -k) mod 8 is blue, then the vertex i is red. wait, perhaps another angle. let's consider that each vertex i has a set of "forbidden" colors based on the requirement. but this seems complicated. alternatively, note that if we fix k, then the condition is that b and ρ^k(b) are disjoint. wait, but ρ^k(b) is the rotated set. so, if we consider b and its rotation by k, they must be disjoint. so, the problem reduces to: for a random subset b of the 8 vertices, what is the probability that there exists a k (0 ≤k ≤7) such that b and ρ^k(b) are disjoint? with the understanding that for k=0, this is only possible if b is empty. for k≠0, it's possible for non-empty b. therefore, the problem is equivalent to computing the probability that a random subset of the 8-cycle has a cyclic shift with which it is disjoint. including the case where b is empty, which only works with k=0, but for non-empty sets, we need some k≠0. so, this seems like we can model this as follows: for each subset b of the 8 vertices, let s(b) be the set of shifts k where b and ρ^k(b) are disjoint. then, we need to compute the probability that s(b) is non-empty. so, the total number of subsets b where there exists some k with b ∩ ρ^k(b) = ∅, divided by 2^8. so, the question is, how many subsets of the 8-cycle have at least one cyclic shift that is disjoint from them. so, the complement of the number of subsets that have no cyclic shift disjoint from them. therefore, perhaps using inclusion-exclusion over the shifts? wait, but inclusion-exclusion over all subsets would be complicated. alternatively, note that the total number of subsets with the required property is equal to the sum over k=0 to 7 of the number of subsets b where k is in s(b)), but since different subsets may have different shifts, this is not straightforward. wait, but maybe using möbius inversion for cyclic groups? alternatively, perhaps there's a generating function approach. alternatively, think of each vertex and its image under rotations. for each vertex i, consider the positions i, i+1, ..., i+7. but this seems messy. wait, another approach: each vertex can be in a "conflict" with its images under rotations. for each vertex i and shift k, j = i +k. if i is blue, then j must be red. but if j is blue, then we have a conflict unless there's a k where this doesn't happen. wait, but this seems like a system of constraints. each blue vertex i imposes that i +k must be red. but for different i, these constraints might interact. so, if we have two blue vertices i and j, then for their constraints not to interfere, we need that i +k and j +k are both red. so, in particular, if i and j are separated by m positions, then (i +k) and (j +k) are separated by m positions. therefore, the conflicts can be modeled as a graph where each blue vertex is connected to its forbidden red vertices? hmm, maybe not. alternatively, perhaps model this as a graph coloring problem. each vertex has to be colored red or blue, with the constraint that for some shift k, all blue vertices shifted by k are red. so, the problem is to count the number of such colorings. alternatively, for each possible shift k, the number of colorings where shifting b by k results in ā, but this is different. wait, but the problem doesn't require that all blue vertices shifted by k give red vertices; just that there exists a k where this holds. so, it's an existential quantifier over k. therefore, the total number of such colorings is the sum over k of the number of colorings where b shifted by k is a subset of ā, minus the overlaps where colorings satisfy multiple k's. but this is again inclusion-exclusion. so, to compute the number of colorings that satisfy the condition for at least one k, we need to compute: sum_{k=0}^7 |a_k| - sum_{0 ≤k < l ≤7} |a_k ∩ a_l| + ... + (-1)^{t} |a_{k_1} ∩ ... ∩ a_{k_t}}| ... + |a_0 ∩ ... ∩ a_7|. where |a_k| is the number of colorings where shifting b by k results in a subset of ā. so, first, let's compute |a_k|. for k=0, |a_0| = 1, since only the all-red coloring. for k ≠0, |a_k| is the number of colorings where for all i ∈ b, i +k is in ā. that is, if a vertex is blue, then the vertex k steps ahead is red. so, how many such colorings are there? let's model this as a graph where each vertex is either red or blue, with the constraint that for each vertex i, if i is blue, then i +k is red. this is similar to a constraint satisfaction problem. for a fixed k, this is equivalent to a graph with vertices connected by edges (i, i +k), where each edge must not have both endpoints blue. so, the number of colorings is the number of colorings where no two vertices i and i +k are both blue. so, for each shift k, the number of such colorings is equal to the number of independent sets in the graph where edges connect each vertex to its k-th neighbor. but since the octagon is a cycle, this is a circulant graph. for k=1, it's the cycle graph. for other k's, it's a cycle graph with different jumps. however, computing the number of independent sets in such graphs is non-trivial. alternatively, we can model this as a product of variables. for each vertex i, let x_i be a variable indicating whether it's blue (1) or not (0). then, the constraints are that x_i + x_{i +k} ≤1 for all i. so, the number of colorings is the number of solutions to these inequalities. the generating function for such colorings is known for some graphs. for example, when k=1, this is the standard problem of counting the number of independent sets in a cycle graph, which is where the recurrence comes in. for c_n, the number of independent sets is f_{n+1} where f_n is the fibonacci sequence. wait, but for n=3, that would be f_4=3, but we have 4 independent sets. so, perhaps different. wait, in the cycle graph c_n, the number of independent sets is given by a recurrence. let me check. let’s denote a_n = number of independent sets in c_n. for a path p_n, the number of independent sets is f_{n+2}. for the cycle graph c_n, the number is f_{n+2} - f_n = f_{n+1} + f_{n-1} - f_n = f_{n+1} - f_{n-1}. wait, but that's not right. let me think again. alternatively, for the cycle graph c_n, the number of independent sets is f_{n} + 1? wait, not sure. maybe i need to calculate for small n. for n=1: 2 independent sets (color it red or blue). for n=2: cycle of two vertices. each has the constraint that they can't both be blue. so, the independent sets are: {}, {1}, {2}. so, 3. which is 2^2 -1=3. so, in general, for c_n, the number of independent sets is 2^n - number of colorings where at least one pair of adjacent vertices are both blue. but that's not straightforward. alternatively, for the cycle graph c_n, the number of independent sets is given by the recursion a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} - a_{n-3}. for example: a(1) =2, a(2)=3, a(3)=4, a(4)=7, a(5)=11, etc. wait, but this seems similar to the recurrence for the number of necklaces. however, perhaps not. alternatively, let me consider for k=1, the number of colorings where no two adjacent vertices are both blue. for a cycle graph c_8, the number of such colorings is given by the formula: let’s denote a_n = number of independent sets in c_n. then, the recurrence is a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} - a_{n-3}. but i need to verify. for n=3, a_3 = 4. let's compute a_3: c_3. the independent sets are {}, {1}, {2}, {3}, so 4. wait, but according to the formula a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} - a_{n-3}}, a_3 would be a_2 + a_1 - a_0 = 3 + 2 -1=4. but a_0 is 1. wait, maybe not. alternatively, the formula for the number of independent sets in c_n is 2 \times fibonacci(n +1) - 2. not sure. alternatively, let's look up the sequence. for n=3:4; n=4:7; n=5:11; n=6:18; n=7:29; n=8:47. wait, these numbers correspond to something else. let me check the actual values. for a cycle graph c_n, the number of independent sets (including the empty set) is given by the recurrence a(n) = a(n-1) + a(n-2) - a(n-4) - a(n-5) + a(n-6) + ... this seems complicated. alternatively, perhaps use generating functions. wait, but maybe for k=1, the number of colorings is a(n) = 2a(n-1) - a(n-2) + a(0). not sure. wait, maybe not. let me consider that for each vertex, coloring it blue fixes the color of the vertex k steps ahead to red. so, for k=1, if we color vertex 1 blue, then vertex 2 must be red, then vertex 3 can be either color, etc. but this is similar to a linear recurrence. wait, for a linear chain, the number of such colorings is indeed a linear recurrence. for a cycle, it's more complex. alternatively, for k=1, the number of colorings is equal to the (8-th fibonacci number) but no, not exactly. let me compute for n=8. if it's a cycle graph c_8, the number of independent sets is 47, according to some references. but that would mean that |a_1| =47. but 47 is a prime number. then, the total number of colorings for k=1 would be 47. similarly, for k=2, which is a graph where edges connect vertices two apart. what is the number of independent sets in that graph? for example, for k=2, the graph is a 2-factor: two disjoint 4-cycles. so, the cycle graph c_8 with edges between vertices two apart is actually two separate 4-cycles. therefore, the number of independent sets in this graph is (number of independent sets in c_4)^2. for c_4, the number of independent sets is 7. therefore, (7)^2=49. therefore, for k=2, |a_2|=49. similarly, for k=4, the graph is four disjoint edges. the number of independent sets for each edge is 3 (red-red, red-blue, blue-red), but since they are disjoint edges, the total is 3^4=81. wait, but no. for k=4, each edge is a pair of diametrically opposite vertices. so, each such edge is just two vertices antipodal, and the independent sets would be those where not both are blue. but for four such pairs, the total number of colorings where no two vertices distance 4 apart are both blue is 2^4 * (1 +1) = 16*2=32? wait,
