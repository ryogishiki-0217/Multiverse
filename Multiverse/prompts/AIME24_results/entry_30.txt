Okay, let's try to tackle this problem.
So, we have a 5x5 grid, 25 white chips, and 25 black chips.
We need to place some of them in the grid cells such that each cell has at most one chip.
The conditions are that all chips in the same row and column must be the same color, and that we can't add any more chips without violating the conditions.
Hmm, okay.
Let me break this down step by step.
First, the problem says "each cell contains at most one chip."
So we can have empty cells.
But we need to place as many chips as possible without violating the color conditions.
The color conditions are that in each row and each column, all chips must be the same color.
So, for example, if in a certain row, there is at least one chip, all those chips must be either all white or all black.
Same with columns.
Also, the third condition is that adding any more chip would violate the color conditions.
So the arrangement must be maximal in the sense that you can't add another chip without breaking the rules.
So the problem is to count the number of such maximal arrangements.
Let me think of how such a grid would look.
If a row has at least one chip, they must all be the same color.
Similarly for columns.
So if we have a row that's all white, then every column intersecting this row must also be white (if they have any chips in that row).
But if a column can have any color as long as it's consistent, right?
Wait, but each column also must have all chips of the same color.
So suppose row 1 is all white.
Then, any chip in column 1 must also be white, because column 1 intersects row 1 at position (1,1).
So if row 1 is white, then column 1 must be white if there's a chip at (1,1).
Similarly, if column 1 is white, then any chip in row 1 of column 1 must be white.
Therefore, the color of a row is determined by the color of the chip in any column of that row, assuming there is at least one chip in that row.
So essentially, if we have some rows colored white and some black, and similarly for columns, but such that if a row and column intersect at a cell where both the row and column are colored, they must have the same color.
Otherwise, that cell would have conflicting color requirements.
Therefore, this seems similar to a bipartite graph where rows and columns are partitions, and edges represent non-empty cells.
The colors of rows and columns must agree on the edges.
So maybe this is a bicoloring problem?
Or something like a bipartite coloring.
But since the colors have to be consistent per row and per column, the grid can be seen as the Cartesian product of two sets (rows and columns), each colored black or white, such that the color of a cell (i,j) is the minimum of the color of row i and column j.
Wait, but if both row i and column j are white, then the cell (i,j) must be white.
If both are black, the cell is black.
But if one is white and the other is black, there's a conflict unless the cell is empty.
Wait, perhaps another way: If a cell (i,j) is non-empty, then both row i and column j must be of the same color.
Therefore, non-empty cells must form sets where each row and each column is monochromatic.
But the non-empty cells can be a combination of white and black rows and columns.
Wait, but if you have a non-empty cell (i,j), then row i and column j must both be the same color.
So, perhaps the non-empty rows and non-empty columns form a bicoloring where each non-empty row is colored either white or black, and each non-empty column is colored either white or black, such that for every (i,j) with a chip, the row i's color and column j's color are equal.
And for any (i,j) without a chip, either row i or column j is empty, or their colors would conflict.
Therefore, the structure is such that the placement of chips is the union of some all-white rows/columns and some all-black rows/columns, such that no white and black intersect in a cell (since that would require both a white and black chip in the same cell, which is forbidden).
Therefore, the non-empty cells form a partition of the grid into at most two monochromatic rectangles.
Wait, but in this case, maybe even more general: the grid is partitioned into four regions: white rows intersect white columns, white rows intersect black columns (empty), black rows intersect white columns (empty), and black rows intersect black columns.
But if the white rows and white columns form a complete bipartite subgraph (i.e., a rectangle), and similarly for black, but the two colors can't overlap.
But actually, the entire grid can be divided into four parts: R_w × C_w (white), R_w × C_b (empty), R_b × C_w (empty), R_b × C_b (black).
So the white chips go into the intersection of white rows and white columns, and the black chips go into the intersection of black rows and black columns.
The rows and columns not in R_w or R_b must be empty, same with columns.
Therefore, the problem reduces to selecting two sets of rows R_w and R_b (with R_w ∩ R_b = ∅) and two sets of columns C_w and C_b (with C_w ∩ C_b = ∅), such that the white chips fill R_w × C_w and the black chips fill R_b × C_b.
Furthermore, the condition that adding another chip would force a color change implies that any empty cell (i,j) must be such that either row i is entirely filled (so adding a chip there would create a color conflict if you tried to add a different color) or column j is entirely filled, or both.
Wait, no.
Wait, the condition is that adding any chip would violate the color conditions.
Since the color conditions are that all chips in the same row and column must have the same color.
So, if you have an empty cell (i,j), then if you were to place a chip there, it would have to be the same color as all other chips in row i and column j.
But if row i or column j is empty, you could place either color.
Therefore, the only way adding a chip to (i,j) would violate the conditions is if row i or column j is non-empty, and the color of the chip you add is different from the existing color in that row or column.
But the problem states that adding any chip (without specifying color) would violate the conditions.
Wait, but the problem says "any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions."
The two conditions being that each cell contains at most one chip (which is already satisfied as we're only placing some chips), all chips in the same row and column have the same colour.
So the violation would be either exceeding one chip per cell (but since the grid is only partially filled, adding another chip would just be one chip in a cell that was empty before, so that's okay in terms of "at most one chip").
Therefore, the only condition that could be violated is the same color per row and column.
So adding a chip of any color to an empty cell (i,j) would violate the same color condition.
Therefore, that would mean that in order to not violate the color condition, the chip added must be the same color as the existing chips in row i and column j.
But if row i is colored white and column j is colored black, then you can't add a chip there without conflicting.
But if both row i and column j are empty, then you can add either a white or black chip there.
Therefore, the third condition says that every empty cell (i,j) is such that either row i is already colored (all chips in row i are white or black) or column j is already colored.
So if either the row or the column is already colored, then adding a chip of the opposite color would violate the condition, but even adding a chip of the same color would potentially violate the condition if the other (column or row) is colored oppositely.
Wait, but if both the row and column are not yet colored (i.e., empty), then you can add a chip of either color.
Therefore, the maximality condition means that there are no empty cells (i,j) where both row i and column j are empty.
Because if there is such a cell, you can add a chip of arbitrary color without violating the color conditions.
Therefore, the third condition implies that every empty cell (i,j) must have either row i or column j already containing chips (of a single color).
Therefore, the grid must be such that all empty rows (those not entirely filled) have no empty cells.
Wait, maybe not.
Let me think again.
If an empty cell (i,j) is such that neither row i nor column j is entirely filled, then you could add a chip there without violating the color conditions.
Therefore, the maximality requires that such cells do not exist.
That is, every cell not already containing a chip must be in a row or column that is already entirely filled with chips of a single color.
Therefore, the filled rows and columns partition the grid in such a way that the union of filled rows and filled columns covers all cells not already filled.
Therefore, the structure of the grid must be that there are some entirely filled rows (each filled with white or black chips) and some entirely filled columns (each filled with white or black chips), such that the union of these rows and columns covers all cells.
However, the intersection of a filled row and a filled column must be a cell that is filled with a chip of the same color.
Therefore, if a row is filled with white chips and a column is filled with white chips, their intersection is a white chip.
If a row is white and a column is black, their intersection must be empty (since you can't have both white and black in the same cell).
But wait, actually, if a row is white and a column is black, their intersection would have to be a cell that is both white and black, which is impossible, hence that cell must be empty.
Therefore, the filled rows and columns must be such that rows filled with white have their columns either also white or empty, and rows filled with black have their columns either also black or empty.
Similarly for columns.
Therefore, the grid can be divided into four regions:
- Rows and columns colored white: their intersection is white chips.
- Rows colored white and columns colored black: their intersection is empty.
- Rows colored black and columns colored white: their intersection is empty.
- Rows colored black and columns colored black: their intersection is black chips.
Therefore, the entire grid is partitioned into these four regions.
The key insight is that the non-empty cells form two rectangles: one white and one black, which are separated by empty columns and rows.
But actually, since rows and columns can be arranged, the two rectangles can be in different parts of the grid.
But how does this affect the counting?
Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as choosing two sets: one set of rows for white and the rest for black, and similarly for columns.
But not exactly.
Let's formalize this.
Let’s denote:
- Let R_w be the set of white rows.
- Let R_b be the set of black rows.
- Let C_w be the set of white columns.
- Let C_b be the set of black columns.
Then, the intersections R_w × C_w are white chips, R_b × C_b are black chips, R_w × C_b are empty, and R_b × C_w are empty.
But since rows not in R_w ∪ R_b are empty (neither white nor black), same with columns.
Wait, but the maximality condition says that every cell not in R_w × C_w or R_b × C_b must be such that either its row is in R_w or R_b, or its column is in C_w or C_b.
Therefore, the union of all rows in R_w ∪ R_b and columns in C_w ∪ C_b must cover the entire grid.
Because if there is a cell (i,j) where row i is not in R_w ∪ R_b and column j is not in C_w ∪ C_b, then we could place a chip in (i,j) without violating the color conditions, which would contradict maximality.
Therefore, the entire grid must be covered by the union of rows in R_w ∪ R_b and columns in C_w ∪ C_b.
Therefore, each row is either entirely white (in R_w), entirely black (in R_b), or not in R_w ∪ R_b (all empty), and similarly for columns.
But since the union of these rows and columns must cover the entire grid, every cell (i,j) must be in at least one of: a white row, a black row, a white column, or a black column.
However, the intersection of a white row and a white column is a white chip.
Similarly for black.
The intersection of a white row and a black column must be empty, since that cell would need to be both white and black.
Similarly, black row and white column is empty.
Therefore, the non-empty cells are precisely the intersections of white rows with white columns and black rows with black columns.
Moreover, the maximality condition implies that the union of all white rows and columns and black rows and columns covers the entire grid.
Therefore, any cell not in R_w × C_w or R_b × C_b must be in a row that is entirely filled (i.e., in R_w or R_b) or a column that is entirely filled (in C_w or C_b).
But since R_w × C_w and R_b × C_b are already filled, the remaining cells in R_w × C_b must be in row set R_w but column set not in C_w ∪ C_b (but column set is only C_w and C_b, so if a column is not in C_w ∪ C_b, it's empty).
Wait, maybe this is getting too convoluted.
Let's rephrase.
Each row is either all white, all black, or empty.
Similarly, each column is either all white, all black, or empty.
However, the combination must be such that any non-empty cell (i,j) is white if and only if row i is white and column j is white; similarly for black.
Therefore, the white cells form a complete bipartite subgraph K_{|R_w|, |C_w|}, and the black cells form a complete bipartite subgraph K_{|R_b|, |C_b|}, with the two subgraphs being disjoint (since a cell can't be both white and black).
Furthermore, the union of all white and black cells must cover all rows and columns that are not entirely empty.
But the maximality condition requires that every cell not already containing a chip (white or black) is such that either its row or its column is already entirely filled.
Therefore, if a cell (i,j) is empty, then either row i is entirely filled (all white or all black), or column j is entirely filled (all white or all black).
Therefore, the entire grid is partitioned into four types of cells:
1. White chips: in R_w × C_w
2. Black chips: in R_b × C_b
3. Empty cells in R_w × C_b (but these cells must be empty because row is white and column is black)
4. Empty cells in R_b × C_w (empty because row is black and column is white)
Additionally, the remaining cells, not in R_w ∪ R_b (rows) and not in C_w ∪ C_b (columns), must be empty, but since these cells are in entirely empty rows and columns, they are automatically empty.
But according to the maximality condition, every empty cell must be in a filled row or filled column.
Therefore, the only empty cells are those in R_w × C_b, R_b × C_w, and possibly some cells in the empty rows and columns, but those are already covered by the previous condition.
Wait, but if a cell is in an empty row and an empty column, then it is empty, but since the empty row and column are not filled, according to maximality, we should be able to add a chip there?
But the maximality condition says that adding any chip would violate the color conditions.
However, if a cell is in an empty row and an empty column, then adding a chip there (either white or black) would not violate the color conditions, because the row and column are empty.
Therefore, to satisfy the maximality condition, there can't be such cells.
Therefore, all rows and columns must be either entirely white, entirely black, or such that they contain some empty cells that are forced because of the color conflicts with rows or columns of opposite color.
But given the maximality condition, perhaps all rows and columns must be entirely filled.
Wait, no.
If a row is partially filled, say, with white chips, then the columns corresponding to those white chips must also be white.
But then the rest of the row's cells must be in columns that are black or empty.
But if the row is partially filled, and the remaining cells in that row are in empty columns, then those columns could be filled with chips of the same color as the row.
Wait, but the maximality condition would be violated if we could add more chips.
So, if a row is only partially filled, then there must be columns that are empty.
However, adding a chip to an empty cell in that row would require that the column be the same color as the row.
If the column was previously empty, we could color the column the same as the row and place the chip.
Therefore, the maximality condition would require that no such columns exist.
Therefore, perhaps all filled rows must be entirely filled, and all filled columns must be entirely filled.
Wait, let's suppose that in order to satisfy the maximality, any row that is not entirely filled (i.e., has some empty cells) must have those empty cells be in columns that are already entirely filled with the opposite color.
Similarly for columns.
But this complicates things.
Alternatively, perhaps the only way to satisfy the maximality is to have that every row is either entirely white, entirely black, or entirely empty, and similarly for columns, and that the intersections of white rows and black columns, and black rows and white columns, are empty.
But also, that every empty cell is in a row or column that is entirely filled.
Wait, perhaps an example would help.
Let’s consider a smaller grid, maybe 2x2.
Suppose in a 2x2 grid, we have the top row all white and the left column all black.
Then the top-left cell is conflicting, which is not allowed.
Therefore, this arrangement is invalid.
Alternatively, if the top row is white and the left column is empty.
Then the top-left cell is empty.
But since the row is white, the cell could be white, but if the column is empty, then that cell is in an otherwise empty column.
But the maximality condition says that you can't add another chip.
Wait, if the top row is white and the left column is empty, then in the top-left cell, you can add a black chip because the row allows white and the column is empty.
Adding a black chip there would not violate the color conditions because the column is empty, so you can set its color to black, and the row already has white chips, so adding a black chip in the same row is not allowed, but the row is already white.
Wait, if you add a black chip to the top-left cell, which is in the top white row and the left column.
If the left column is now black, but the top row is white, then the cell (1,1) would have to be both white and black, which is a conflict.
Therefore, you cannot add a chip there.
Wait, actually, the problem states that all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour.
So, if the top row is white, then any chip in that row must be white.
If you try to add a chip in the top-left cell, which is in the top white row, you have to make it white.
But if the left column is empty, you could choose to make it white or black.
Therefore, you could add a white chip there, which would make the left column white as well.
But then, that doesn't violate the conditions.
Wait, but the original row is white.
So adding a white chip to the left column would make the left column white.
So this is allowed.
Therefore, the original grid with top row white and left column empty is not maximal, because you can add a white chip to the top-left cell.
Therefore, the maximality requires that in such a case, you cannot add any chip.
Therefore, if a row is white and a column is empty, their intersection must be empty, but adding a white chip there is allowed, which would extend the white row and column.
Therefore, to prevent that, the only way is that either the row is already full (i.e., all cells are white) or the column is already full (but in our example, the row isn't full because there's an empty cell).
Therefore, the maximality requires that all white rows are completely filled with white chips, and all white columns are completely filled with white chips.
Similarly for black.
Therefore, the conclusion is that all non-empty rows and non-empty columns must be entirely filled with chips of a single color, and the colors of rows and columns must agree on the intersections.
Therefore, the grid is divided into white and black regions, each being a rectangle covering entire rows and columns.
The white region is R_w × C_w, entirely filled with white chips, and the black region is R_b × C_b, entirely filled with black chips, and these two regions are disjoint.
Additionally, the remaining rows and columns can be empty, but due to the maximality condition, the union of R_w ∪ R_b and C_w ∪ C_b must cover the entire grid.
Wait, no.
Because if a row is not in R_w ∪ R_b, it's empty, and similarly for columns.
But if there's an empty row i and an empty column j, then cell (i,j) would be empty, and we could add a chip there.
But according to the maximality condition, we cannot.
Therefore, there cannot be both an entirely empty row and an entirely empty column.
Otherwise, their intersection would allow adding a chip.
Therefore, the maximality implies that either all rows are partially filled (but in our case, partially filled rows must be fully filled because of the color condition) or all columns are partially filled.
Wait, but maybe more precisely: if there exists an empty row r and an empty column c, then placing a white or black chip at (r,c) would not violate the color conditions, since the row and column are empty.
Therefore, the existence of both an empty row and an empty column would violate the maximality condition.
Therefore, in a maximal grid, there can be at most empty rows or empty columns, but not both.
That is, either all rows are filled (some white, some black, some mixed via columns), but allowing empty columns; or all columns are filled, allowing empty rows.
But given that the grid is 5x5, perhaps the structure is that there is a white block (rectangle) and a black block (rectangle), arranged such that their projections onto rows and columns cover all rows and columns.
Alternatively, perhaps the grid is partitioned into two rectangles, one white and one black, along a row or column.
For example, the first k rows are white and the remaining rows are black, with some columns possibly empty.
Wait, but if the first k rows are white, then the columns intersecting those rows must also be white.
But if the remaining rows are black, then those rows can only have black chips in columns that are black.
But then the intersection of white rows and black columns must be empty.
But if the white rows are from 1 to k and the black rows are k+1 to 5, then the columns can be partitioned into white and black.
The intersection of white rows and white columns gives white chips, white rows and black columns are empty, black rows and white columns are empty, and black rows and black columns are filled with black chips.
But in this case, the white rows and white columns form a k × m white rectangle, and the black rows and black columns form a (5 - k) × (5 - m) black rectangle.
The rest of the cells are empty.
But to satisfy maximality, we need that every empty cell (i,j) is in a filled row or a filled column.
However, if k + (5 - m) < 5 or m + (5 - k) < 5, then there would be cells that are not in any filled row or column, which would allow adding chips there.
Therefore, maximality requires that k + (5 - m) = 5 and m + (5 - k) = 5.
Wait, solving these equations:
k + (5 - m) = 5 ⇒ k - m = 0 ⇒ k = m
Similarly, m + (5 - k) = 5 ⇒ m - k = 0 ⇒ m = k
Therefore, k = m.
Therefore, the number of white rows equals the number of white columns.
Similarly, the number of black rows (5 - k) equals the number of black columns (5 - m) = 5 - k.
Therefore, the grid is partitioned such that there's a k×k white rectangle and a (5 - k)×(5 - k) black rectangle, with k ranging from 0 to 5.
But if k = 0, the white rectangle is empty and the black rectangle is 5×5.
If k = 5, the white rectangle is 5×5 and black is empty.
However, these cases would not satisfy the maximality condition because if the entire grid is one color, then you can still add chips in the other color in empty columns or rows, but wait no, because if the entire grid is white, then all rows and columns are white.
But since there are only 25 chips available, if the entire grid is white (which requires 25 white chips), but we have only 25 white chips.
Then, you couldn't add any more chips.
Similarly for all black.
But in the problem statement, we have 25 white and 25 black chips.
Therefore, if the grid is entirely white, you use all 25 white chips, and you can't add any more.
Similarly for entirely black.
But in the case of mixed colors, perhaps.
Wait, but let's get back.
If the grid is partitioned into a k×k white rectangle and a (5 - k)×(5 - k) black rectangle, with k + (5 - k) = 5.
However, the white and black rectangles are separated by rows and columns.
For example, if the white rectangle is in the top-left k×k corner, then the black rectangle is in the bottom-right (5 - k)×(5 - k) corner.
The rest of the cells (top-right and bottom-left) would be empty.
But in this case, the empty cells are in rows k+1 to 5 and columns 1 to k, and rows 1 to k and columns k+1 to 5.
Each of these empty cells is in a black row (for top-right) or a white column (for bottom-left).
Therefore, adding a chip to these empty cells would violate the color conditions.
For example, a cell in the top-right corner is in a white row (rows 1 to k) and a black column (columns k+1 to 5).
Adding a white chip would conflict with the column's color, adding a black chip would conflict with the row's color.
Therefore, these cells must remain empty.
Similarly, the bottom-left cells are in black rows and white columns, so empty.
Therefore, this arrangement is valid.
Is this the only possible arrangement?
Alternatively, maybe the white and black blocks can be arranged not only in corners but also in other parts of the grid, but given that rows and columns must be entirely filled or not, the only way is to split the grid into two rectangles along a row and a column.
Therefore, such that the white rectangle is the first k rows and first m columns, and the black rectangle is the remaining rows and remaining columns.
But to satisfy the maximality, we must have k + (5 - m) = 5 and m + (5 - k) = 5, leading to k = m.
Therefore, the split must be square-like, i.e., k = m.
Therefore, the white rectangle is k×k, top-left, black is (5 - k)×(5 - k), bottom-right.
Then, the projections of the filled rows and columns cover the entire grid, so the union of white rows (rows 1 to k) and black rows (rows k+1 to 5) is all rows, similarly for columns (columns 1 to k white, k+1 to 5 black).
Therefore, this satisfies the maximality because every empty cell is in a white row and black column or vice versa, so you can't add a chip there without conflict.
Therefore, the possible maximal grids are those where you choose an integer k between 0 and 5, and colors for the top-left k×k block and bottom-right (5 - k)×(5 - k) block.
But also, you could choose to split along a different row or column.
For example, instead of the first k rows, you could choose any k rows.
So the white rectangle could be any k rows and k columns, and the black rectangle the remaining rows and columns.
Therefore, the number of such arrangements would be the sum over k=0 to 5 of the number of ways to choose k rows and k columns, multiplied by 2 (if k ≠ 0 and k ≠5, since you can color the selected rectangle white or black), but wait, not exactly.
Because when you choose k rows and k columns, you assign the intersection to be white, and the remaining rows and columns would form the black block.
So for each k, the number is: C(5, k)^2 * 2, since you can choose k rows and k columns for the white block, and the remaining rows and columns form the black block.
But wait, if k=0, then the entire grid is black, and if k=5, the entire grid is white.
For 1 ≤ k ≤4, choosing k rows and k columns for the white block, and painting the remaining rows and columns black.
But in that case, does choosing k rows and k columns uniquely determine the grid?
Wait, no.
Because once you choose k rows and k columns, you need to make sure that their intersection is white, and the intersection of the remaining rows and columns is black.
But the intersections of the chosen k rows with the remaining 5 - k columns must be empty, which they are because those columns are part of the black block, and the rows are part of the white block, so conflicting.
Similarly, the remaining rows intersecting the chosen columns would be black, but since those rows are part of the black block and the columns are part of the white block, their intersection must be empty.
Therefore, each choice of k rows and k columns determines a unique coloring where the intersection is white, the rest of the white rows and black columns are empty, and the remaining block is black.
But in this case, for each k, the number of such colorings is C(5, k)^2.
However, if k=0 or k=5, then there is only one way (all black or all white).
But the problem allows using any number of white and black chips, as long as the conditions are met.
However, when k is chosen, the white rectangle is k×k, so requires k^2 white chips, and the black rectangle is (5 - k)^2 black chips.
But we have 25 white and 25 black chips available, so for each k, this is feasible.
But the problem states "solve the following math problem" without specifying whether we can use the chips in multiple arrangements.
Wait, no: the problem is to count the number of maximal arrangements possible, given an unlimited supply of chips.
Wait, the problem says "Solve the following math problem: [...] 25 white chips and 25 black chips.
We need to place some of these chips..."
Therefore, each arrangement can use any number of chips up to 25 white and 25 black.
But the key point is that the arrangements must be maximal as per the conditions.
Therefore, the number we need to compute is the total number of such maximal grids.
Going back to our previous analysis, the maximal grids are those where we choose a subset of rows and columns to be white (R_w and C_w), and the complementary subsets to be black (R_b and C_b), such that R_w × C_w are white, R_b × C_b are black, and the rest are empty.
But to satisfy maximality, the union of R_w ∪ R_b and C_w ∪ C_b must be the entire grid.
Wait, no.
If R_w ∪ R_b is all rows, and C_w ∪ C_b is all columns, then the union covers everything, but in that case, R_b and C_b would be the complements of R_w and C_w.
Therefore, the white region is R_w × C_w, and the black region is the complement of R_w × C_w in the grid?
No, not exactly.
The black region is (R \ R_w) × (C \ C_w), assuming R_b = R \ R_w and C_b = C \ C_w.
Therefore, the grid is divided into four parts:
- R_w × C_w: white
- R_w × C_b: empty
- R_b × C_w: empty
- R_b × C_b: black
But if R_w ∪ R_b = all rows and C_w ∪ C_b = all columns, then the entire grid is covered by white, black, and empty cells as above.
However, in this case, the maximality condition is that every empty cell (which are in R_w × C_b and R_b × C_w) is in a row or column that is already entirely filled.
But in this setup, R_w and R_b are all rows, so every row is either entirely white or entirely black.
Similarly, every column is entirely white or black.
But in reality, if a cell is empty, it's because it's in R_w × C_b or R_b × C_w.
For example, a cell in R_w × C_b: its row is white, its column is black, so it's empty.
But the row is filled (all white), so the cell is in a filled row.
Similarly, the column is filled (all black), but the cell is empty because it's at the intersection of a white row and black column.
However, according to the maximality condition, adding a chip there would violate the color conditions.
But actually, if you try to add a white chip, the column is black, which conflicts.
If you add a black chip, the row is white, which conflicts.
Therefore, the cell must remain empty.
Therefore, such a grid is maximal.
Therefore, these grids are determined by choosing a subset of rows to be white (and the rest black) and a subset of columns to be white (and the rest black), such that all white rows and all white columns are non-empty.
Wait, not necessarily.
If you have a white row with a black column, the intersection is empty.
But if the white row has at least one white column, then it's non-empty.
Similarly for white columns.
But the maximality requires that you can't add any more chips.
Therefore, perhaps all white rows must be completely filled with white columns, and all black rows must be completely filled with black columns.
But this seems similar to the previous structure.
Therefore, the number of such maximal grids is equal to the number of ways to choose subsets of rows and columns, each colored white or black, such that the colorings are consistent and maximal.
But more formally, for each possible k and m, where k is the number of white rows and m is the number of white columns, we can have a white rectangle of k×m, and then the rest determined.
But to satisfy maximality, the projections of the white and black rectangles must cover all rows and columns.
Wait, but in order to cover all rows and columns, we must have that the white rows plus black rows equal all rows, and same for columns.
Therefore, for each possible pair (k, m), where k rows are white and 5 - k rows are black, and m columns are white and 5 - m columns are black, we can have the white rectangle k×m and black rectangle (5 - k)×(5 - m).
But then, the empty cells would be k×(5 - m) and (5 - k)×m.
For the grid to be maximal, these empty cells must be covered by the union of white and black rows and columns.
Wait, but if a cell is in a white row and black column (part of the k×(5 - m) empty cells), then it's in a white row (which is filled with white chips in columns 1 to m) and a black column (which is filled with black chips in rows k+1 to 5).
Therefore

solve the following math problem: there is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\times5$ grid such that: 

each cell contains at most one chip
all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour
any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

<think>
okay, let's try to tackle this problem.
so, we have a 5x5 grid, 25 white chips, and 25 black chips.
we need to place some of them in the grid cells such that each cell has at most one chip.
the conditions are that all chips in the same row and column must be the same color, and that we can't add any more chips without violating the conditions.
hmm, okay.
let me break this down step by step.
first, the problem says "each cell contains at most one chip."
so we can have empty cells.
but we need to place as many chips as possible without violating the color conditions.
the color conditions are that in each row and each column, all chips must be the same color.
so, for example, if in a certain row, there is at least one chip, all those chips must be either all white or all black.
same with columns.
also, the third condition is that adding any more chip would violate the color conditions.
so the arrangement must be maximal in the sense that you can't add another chip without breaking the rules.
so the problem is to count the number of such maximal arrangements.
let me think of how such a grid would look.
if a row has at least one chip, they must all be the same color.
similarly for columns.
so if we have a row that's all white, then every column intersecting this row must also be white (if they have any chips in that row).
but if a column can have any color as long as it's consistent, right?
wait, but each column also must have all chips of the same color.
so suppose row 1 is all white.
then, any chip in column 1 must also be white, because column 1 intersects row 1 at position (1,1).
so if row 1 is white, then column 1 must be white if there's a chip at (1,1).
similarly, if column 1 is white, then any chip in row 1 of column 1 must be white.
therefore, the color of a row is determined by the color of the chip in any column of that row, assuming there is at least one chip in that row.
so essentially, if we have some rows colored white and some black, and similarly for columns, but such that if a row and column intersect at a cell where both the row and column are colored, they must have the same color.
otherwise, that cell would have conflicting color requirements.
therefore, this seems similar to a bipartite graph where rows and columns are partitions, and edges represent non-empty cells.
the colors of rows and columns must agree on the edges.
so maybe this is a bicoloring problem?
or something like a bipartite coloring.
but since the colors have to be consistent per row and per column, the grid can be seen as the cartesian product of two sets (rows and columns), each colored black or white, such that the color of a cell (i,j) is the minimum of the color of row i and column j.
wait, but if both row i and column j are white, then the cell (i,j) must be white.
if both are black, the cell is black.
but if one is white and the other is black, there's a conflict unless the cell is empty.
wait, perhaps another way: if a cell (i,j) is non-empty, then both row i and column j must be of the same color.
therefore, non-empty cells must form sets where each row and each column is monochromatic.
but the non-empty cells can be a combination of white and black rows and columns.
wait, but if you have a non-empty cell (i,j), then row i and column j must both be the same color.
so, perhaps the non-empty rows and non-empty columns form a bicoloring where each non-empty row is colored either white or black, and each non-empty column is colored either white or black, such that for every (i,j) with a chip, the row i's color and column j's color are equal.
and for any (i,j) without a chip, either row i or column j is empty, or their colors would conflict.
therefore, the structure is such that the placement of chips is the union of some all-white rows/columns and some all-black rows/columns, such that no white and black intersect in a cell (since that would require both a white and black chip in the same cell, which is forbidden).
therefore, the non-empty cells form a partition of the grid into at most two monochromatic rectangles.
wait, but in this case, maybe even more general: the grid is partitioned into four regions: white rows intersect white columns, white rows intersect black columns (empty), black rows intersect white columns (empty), and black rows intersect black columns.
but if the white rows and white columns form a complete bipartite subgraph (i.e., a rectangle), and similarly for black, but the two colors can't overlap.
but actually, the entire grid can be divided into four parts: r_w × c_w (white), r_w × c_b (empty), r_b × c_w (empty), r_b × c_b (black).
so the white chips go into the intersection of white rows and white columns, and the black chips go into the intersection of black rows and black columns.
the rows and columns not in r_w or r_b must be empty, same with columns.
therefore, the problem reduces to selecting two sets of rows r_w and r_b (with r_w ∩ r_b = ∅) and two sets of columns c_w and c_b (with c_w ∩ c_b = ∅), such that the white chips fill r_w × c_w and the black chips fill r_b × c_b.
furthermore, the condition that adding another chip would force a color change implies that any empty cell (i,j) must be such that either row i is entirely filled (so adding a chip there would create a color conflict if you tried to add a different color) or column j is entirely filled, or both.
wait, no.
wait, the condition is that adding any chip would violate the color conditions.
since the color conditions are that all chips in the same row and column must have the same color.
so, if you have an empty cell (i,j), then if you were to place a chip there, it would have to be the same color as all other chips in row i and column j.
but if row i or column j is empty, you could place either color.
therefore, the only way adding a chip to (i,j) would violate the conditions is if row i or column j is non-empty, and the color of the chip you add is different from the existing color in that row or column.
but the problem states that adding any chip (without specifying color) would violate the conditions.
wait, but the problem says "any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions."
the two conditions being that each cell contains at most one chip (which is already satisfied as we're only placing some chips), all chips in the same row and column have the same colour.
so the violation would be either exceeding one chip per cell (but since the grid is only partially filled, adding another chip would just be one chip in a cell that was empty before, so that's okay in terms of "at most one chip").
therefore, the only condition that could be violated is the same color per row and column.
so adding a chip of any color to an empty cell (i,j) would violate the same color condition.
therefore, that would mean that in order to not violate the color condition, the chip added must be the same color as the existing chips in row i and column j.
but if row i is colored white and column j is colored black, then you can't add a chip there without conflicting.
but if both row i and column j are empty, then you can add either a white or black chip there.
therefore, the third condition says that every empty cell (i,j) is such that either row i is already colored (all chips in row i are white or black) or column j is already colored.
so if either the row or the column is already colored, then adding a chip of the opposite color would violate the condition, but even adding a chip of the same color would potentially violate the condition if the other (column or row) is colored oppositely.
wait, but if both the row and column are not yet colored (i.e., empty), then you can add a chip of either color.
therefore, the maximality condition means that there are no empty cells (i,j) where both row i and column j are empty.
because if there is such a cell, you can add a chip of arbitrary color without violating the color conditions.
therefore, the third condition implies that every empty cell (i,j) must have either row i or column j already containing chips (of a single color).
therefore, the grid must be such that all empty rows (those not entirely filled) have no empty cells.
wait, maybe not.
let me think again.
if an empty cell (i,j) is such that neither row i nor column j is entirely filled, then you could add a chip there without violating the color conditions.
therefore, the maximality requires that such cells do not exist.
that is, every cell not already containing a chip must be in a row or column that is already entirely filled with chips of a single color.
therefore, the filled rows and columns partition the grid in such a way that the union of filled rows and filled columns covers all cells not already filled.
therefore, the structure of the grid must be that there are some entirely filled rows (each filled with white or black chips) and some entirely filled columns (each filled with white or black chips), such that the union of these rows and columns covers all cells.
however, the intersection of a filled row and a filled column must be a cell that is filled with a chip of the same color.
therefore, if a row is filled with white chips and a column is filled with white chips, their intersection is a white chip.
if a row is white and a column is black, their intersection must be empty (since you can't have both white and black in the same cell).
but wait, actually, if a row is white and a column is black, their intersection would have to be a cell that is both white and black, which is impossible, hence that cell must be empty.
therefore, the filled rows and columns must be such that rows filled with white have their columns either also white or empty, and rows filled with black have their columns either also black or empty.
similarly for columns.
therefore, the grid can be divided into four regions:
- rows and columns colored white: their intersection is white chips.
- rows colored white and columns colored black: their intersection is empty.
- rows colored black and columns colored white: their intersection is empty.
- rows colored black and columns colored black: their intersection is black chips.
therefore, the entire grid is partitioned into these four regions.
the key insight is that the non-empty cells form two rectangles: one white and one black, which are separated by empty columns and rows.
but actually, since rows and columns can be arranged, the two rectangles can be in different parts of the grid.
but how does this affect the counting?
alternatively, perhaps we can model this as choosing two sets: one set of rows for white and the rest for black, and similarly for columns.
but not exactly.
let's formalize this.
let’s denote:
- let r_w be the set of white rows.
- let r_b be the set of black rows.
- let c_w be the set of white columns.
- let c_b be the set of black columns.
then, the intersections r_w × c_w are white chips, r_b × c_b are black chips, r_w × c_b are empty, and r_b × c_w are empty.
but since rows not in r_w ∪ r_b are empty (neither white nor black), same with columns.
wait, but the maximality condition says that every cell not in r_w × c_w or r_b × c_b must be such that either its row is in r_w or r_b, or its column is in c_w or c_b.
therefore, the union of all rows in r_w ∪ r_b and columns in c_w ∪ c_b must cover the entire grid.
because if there is a cell (i,j) where row i is not in r_w ∪ r_b and column j is not in c_w ∪ c_b, then we could place a chip in (i,j) without violating the color conditions, which would contradict maximality.
therefore, the entire grid must be covered by the union of rows in r_w ∪ r_b and columns in c_w ∪ c_b.
therefore, each row is either entirely white (in r_w), entirely black (in r_b), or not in r_w ∪ r_b (all empty), and similarly for columns.
but since the union of these rows and columns must cover the entire grid, every cell (i,j) must be in at least one of: a white row, a black row, a white column, or a black column.
however, the intersection of a white row and a white column is a white chip.
similarly for black.
the intersection of a white row and a black column must be empty, since that cell would need to be both white and black.
similarly, black row and white column is empty.
therefore, the non-empty cells are precisely the intersections of white rows with white columns and black rows with black columns.
moreover, the maximality condition implies that the union of all white rows and columns and black rows and columns covers the entire grid.
therefore, any cell not in r_w × c_w or r_b × c_b must be in a row that is entirely filled (i.e., in r_w or r_b) or a column that is entirely filled (in c_w or c_b).
but since r_w × c_w and r_b × c_b are already filled, the remaining cells in r_w × c_b must be in row set r_w but column set not in c_w ∪ c_b (but column set is only c_w and c_b, so if a column is not in c_w ∪ c_b, it's empty).
wait, maybe this is getting too convoluted.
let's rephrase.
each row is either all white, all black, or empty.
similarly, each column is either all white, all black, or empty.
however, the combination must be such that any non-empty cell (i,j) is white if and only if row i is white and column j is white; similarly for black.
therefore, the white cells form a complete bipartite subgraph k_{|r_w|, |c_w|}, and the black cells form a complete bipartite subgraph k_{|r_b|, |c_b|}, with the two subgraphs being disjoint (since a cell can't be both white and black).
furthermore, the union of all white and black cells must cover all rows and columns that are not entirely empty.
but the maximality condition requires that every cell not already containing a chip (white or black) is such that either its row or its column is already entirely filled.
therefore, if a cell (i,j) is empty, then either row i is entirely filled (all white or all black), or column j is entirely filled (all white or all black).
therefore, the entire grid is partitioned into four types of cells:
1. white chips: in r_w × c_w
2. black chips: in r_b × c_b
3. empty cells in r_w × c_b (but these cells must be empty because row is white and column is black)
4. empty cells in r_b × c_w (empty because row is black and column is white)
additionally, the remaining cells, not in r_w ∪ r_b (rows) and not in c_w ∪ c_b (columns), must be empty, but since these cells are in entirely empty rows and columns, they are automatically empty.
but according to the maximality condition, every empty cell must be in a filled row or filled column.
therefore, the only empty cells are those in r_w × c_b, r_b × c_w, and possibly some cells in the empty rows and columns, but those are already covered by the previous condition.
wait, but if a cell is in an empty row and an empty column, then it is empty, but since the empty row and column are not filled, according to maximality, we should be able to add a chip there?
but the maximality condition says that adding any chip would violate the color conditions.
however, if a cell is in an empty row and an empty column, then adding a chip there (either white or black) would not violate the color conditions, because the row and column are empty.
therefore, to satisfy the maximality condition, there can't be such cells.
therefore, all rows and columns must be either entirely white, entirely black, or such that they contain some empty cells that are forced because of the color conflicts with rows or columns of opposite color.
but given the maximality condition, perhaps all rows and columns must be entirely filled.
wait, no.
if a row is partially filled, say, with white chips, then the columns corresponding to those white chips must also be white.
but then the rest of the row's cells must be in columns that are black or empty.
but if the row is partially filled, and the remaining cells in that row are in empty columns, then those columns could be filled with chips of the same color as the row.
wait, but the maximality condition would be violated if we could add more chips.
so, if a row is only partially filled, then there must be columns that are empty.
however, adding a chip to an empty cell in that row would require that the column be the same color as the row.
if the column was previously empty, we could color the column the same as the row and place the chip.
therefore, the maximality condition would require that no such columns exist.
therefore, perhaps all filled rows must be entirely filled, and all filled columns must be entirely filled.
wait, let's suppose that in order to satisfy the maximality, any row that is not entirely filled (i.e., has some empty cells) must have those empty cells be in columns that are already entirely filled with the opposite color.
similarly for columns.
but this complicates things.
alternatively, perhaps the only way to satisfy the maximality is to have that every row is either entirely white, entirely black, or entirely empty, and similarly for columns, and that the intersections of white rows and black columns, and black rows and white columns, are empty.
but also, that every empty cell is in a row or column that is entirely filled.
wait, perhaps an example would help.
let’s consider a smaller grid, maybe 2x2.
suppose in a 2x2 grid, we have the top row all white and the left column all black.
then the top-left cell is conflicting, which is not allowed.
therefore, this arrangement is invalid.
alternatively, if the top row is white and the left column is empty.
then the top-left cell is empty.
but since the row is white, the cell could be white, but if the column is empty, then that cell is in an otherwise empty column.
but the maximality condition says that you can't add another chip.
wait, if the top row is white and the left column is empty, then in the top-left cell, you can add a black chip because the row allows white and the column is empty.
adding a black chip there would not violate the color conditions because the column is empty, so you can set its color to black, and the row already has white chips, so adding a black chip in the same row is not allowed, but the row is already white.
wait, if you add a black chip to the top-left cell, which is in the top white row and the left column.
if the left column is now black, but the top row is white, then the cell (1,1) would have to be both white and black, which is a conflict.
therefore, you cannot add a chip there.
wait, actually, the problem states that all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour.
so, if the top row is white, then any chip in that row must be white.
if you try to add a chip in the top-left cell, which is in the top white row, you have to make it white.
but if the left column is empty, you could choose to make it white or black.
therefore, you could add a white chip there, which would make the left column white as well.
but then, that doesn't violate the conditions.
wait, but the original row is white.
so adding a white chip to the left column would make the left column white.
so this is allowed.
therefore, the original grid with top row white and left column empty is not maximal, because you can add a white chip to the top-left cell.
therefore, the maximality requires that in such a case, you cannot add any chip.
therefore, if a row is white and a column is empty, their intersection must be empty, but adding a white chip there is allowed, which would extend the white row and column.
therefore, to prevent that, the only way is that either the row is already full (i.e., all cells are white) or the column is already full (but in our example, the row isn't full because there's an empty cell).
therefore, the maximality requires that all white rows are completely filled with white chips, and all white columns are completely filled with white chips.
similarly for black.
therefore, the conclusion is that all non-empty rows and non-empty columns must be entirely filled with chips of a single color, and the colors of rows and columns must agree on the intersections.
therefore, the grid is divided into white and black regions, each being a rectangle covering entire rows and columns.
the white region is r_w × c_w, entirely filled with white chips, and the black region is r_b × c_b, entirely filled with black chips, and these two regions are disjoint.
additionally, the remaining rows and columns can be empty, but due to the maximality condition, the union of r_w ∪ r_b and c_w ∪ c_b must cover the entire grid.
wait, no.
because if a row is not in r_w ∪ r_b, it's empty, and similarly for columns.
but if there's an empty row i and an empty column j, then cell (i,j) would be empty, and we could add a chip there.
but according to the maximality condition, we cannot.
therefore, there cannot be both an entirely empty row and an entirely empty column.
otherwise, their intersection would allow adding a chip.
therefore, the maximality implies that either all rows are partially filled (but in our case, partially filled rows must be fully filled because of the color condition) or all columns are partially filled.
wait, but maybe more precisely: if there exists an empty row r and an empty column c, then placing a white or black chip at (r,c) would not violate the color conditions, since the row and column are empty.
therefore, the existence of both an empty row and an empty column would violate the maximality condition.
therefore, in a maximal grid, there can be at most empty rows or empty columns, but not both.
that is, either all rows are filled (some white, some black, some mixed via columns), but allowing empty columns; or all columns are filled, allowing empty rows.
but given that the grid is 5x5, perhaps the structure is that there is a white block (rectangle) and a black block (rectangle), arranged such that their projections onto rows and columns cover all rows and columns.
alternatively, perhaps the grid is partitioned into two rectangles, one white and one black, along a row or column.
for example, the first k rows are white and the remaining rows are black, with some columns possibly empty.
wait, but if the first k rows are white, then the columns intersecting those rows must also be white.
but if the remaining rows are black, then those rows can only have black chips in columns that are black.
but then the intersection of white rows and black columns must be empty.
but if the white rows are from 1 to k and the black rows are k+1 to 5, then the columns can be partitioned into white and black.
the intersection of white rows and white columns gives white chips, white rows and black columns are empty, black rows and white columns are empty, and black rows and black columns are filled with black chips.
but in this case, the white rows and white columns form a k × m white rectangle, and the black rows and black columns form a (5 - k) × (5 - m) black rectangle.
the rest of the cells are empty.
but to satisfy maximality, we need that every empty cell (i,j) is in a filled row or a filled column.
however, if k + (5 - m) < 5 or m + (5 - k) < 5, then there would be cells that are not in any filled row or column, which would allow adding chips there.
therefore, maximality requires that k + (5 - m) = 5 and m + (5 - k) = 5.
wait, solving these equations:
k + (5 - m) = 5 ⇒ k - m = 0 ⇒ k = m
similarly, m + (5 - k) = 5 ⇒ m - k = 0 ⇒ m = k
therefore, k = m.
therefore, the number of white rows equals the number of white columns.
similarly, the number of black rows (5 - k) equals the number of black columns (5 - m) = 5 - k.
therefore, the grid is partitioned such that there's a k×k white rectangle and a (5 - k)×(5 - k) black rectangle, with k ranging from 0 to 5.
but if k = 0, the white rectangle is empty and the black rectangle is 5×5.
if k = 5, the white rectangle is 5×5 and black is empty.
however, these cases would not satisfy the maximality condition because if the entire grid is one color, then you can still add chips in the other color in empty columns or rows, but wait no, because if the entire grid is white, then all rows and columns are white.
but since there are only 25 chips available, if the entire grid is white (which requires 25 white chips), but we have only 25 white chips.
then, you couldn't add any more chips.
similarly for all black.
but in the problem statement, we have 25 white and 25 black chips.
therefore, if the grid is entirely white, you use all 25 white chips, and you can't add any more.
similarly for entirely black.
but in the case of mixed colors, perhaps.
wait, but let's get back.
if the grid is partitioned into a k×k white rectangle and a (5 - k)×(5 - k) black rectangle, with k + (5 - k) = 5.
however, the white and black rectangles are separated by rows and columns.
for example, if the white rectangle is in the top-left k×k corner, then the black rectangle is in the bottom-right (5 - k)×(5 - k) corner.
the rest of the cells (top-right and bottom-left) would be empty.
but in this case, the empty cells are in rows k+1 to 5 and columns 1 to k, and rows 1 to k and columns k+1 to 5.
each of these empty cells is in a black row (for top-right) or a white column (for bottom-left).
therefore, adding a chip to these empty cells would violate the color conditions.
for example, a cell in the top-right corner is in a white row (rows 1 to k) and a black column (columns k+1 to 5).
adding a white chip would conflict with the column's color, adding a black chip would conflict with the row's color.
therefore, these cells must remain empty.
similarly, the bottom-left cells are in black rows and white columns, so empty.
therefore, this arrangement is valid.
is this the only possible arrangement?
alternatively, maybe the white and black blocks can be arranged not only in corners but also in other parts of the grid, but given that rows and columns must be entirely filled or not, the only way is to split the grid into two rectangles along a row and a column.
therefore, such that the white rectangle is the first k rows and first m columns, and the black rectangle is the remaining rows and remaining columns.
but to satisfy the maximality, we must have k + (5 - m) = 5 and m + (5 - k) = 5, leading to k = m.
therefore, the split must be square-like, i.e., k = m.
therefore, the white rectangle is k×k, top-left, black is (5 - k)×(5 - k), bottom-right.
then, the projections of the filled rows and columns cover the entire grid, so the union of white rows (rows 1 to k) and black rows (rows k+1 to 5) is all rows, similarly for columns (columns 1 to k white, k+1 to 5 black).
therefore, this satisfies the maximality because every empty cell is in a white row and black column or vice versa, so you can't add a chip there without conflict.
therefore, the possible maximal grids are those where you choose an integer k between 0 and 5, and colors for the top-left k×k block and bottom-right (5 - k)×(5 - k) block.
but also, you could choose to split along a different row or column.
for example, instead of the first k rows, you could choose any k rows.
so the white rectangle could be any k rows and k columns, and the black rectangle the remaining rows and columns.
therefore, the number of such arrangements would be the sum over k=0 to 5 of the number of ways to choose k rows and k columns, multiplied by 2 (if k ≠ 0 and k ≠5, since you can color the selected rectangle white or black), but wait, not exactly.
because when you choose k rows and k columns, you assign the intersection to be white, and the remaining rows and columns would form the black block.
so for each k, the number is: c(5, k)^2 * 2, since you can choose k rows and k columns for the white block, and the remaining rows and columns form the black block.
but wait, if k=0, then the entire grid is black, and if k=5, the entire grid is white.
for 1 ≤ k ≤4, choosing k rows and k columns for the white block, and painting the remaining rows and columns black.
but in that case, does choosing k rows and k columns uniquely determine the grid?
wait, no.
because once you choose k rows and k columns, you need to make sure that their intersection is white, and the intersection of the remaining rows and columns is black.
but the intersections of the chosen k rows with the remaining 5 - k columns must be empty, which they are because those columns are part of the black block, and the rows are part of the white block, so conflicting.
similarly, the remaining rows intersecting the chosen columns would be black, but since those rows are part of the black block and the columns are part of the white block, their intersection must be empty.
therefore, each choice of k rows and k columns determines a unique coloring where the intersection is white, the rest of the white rows and black columns are empty, and the remaining block is black.
but in this case, for each k, the number of such colorings is c(5, k)^2.
however, if k=0 or k=5, then there is only one way (all black or all white).
but the problem allows using any number of white and black chips, as long as the conditions are met.
however, when k is chosen, the white rectangle is k×k, so requires k^2 white chips, and the black rectangle is (5 - k)^2 black chips.
but we have 25 white and 25 black chips available, so for each k, this is feasible.
but the problem states "solve the following math problem" without specifying whether we can use the chips in multiple arrangements.
wait, no: the problem is to count the number of maximal arrangements possible, given an unlimited supply of chips.
wait, the problem says "solve the following math problem: [...] 25 white chips and 25 black chips.
we need to place some of these chips..."
therefore, each arrangement can use any number of chips up to 25 white and 25 black.
but the key point is that the arrangements must be maximal as per the conditions.
therefore, the number we need to compute is the total number of such maximal grids.
going back to our previous analysis, the maximal grids are those where we choose a subset of rows and columns to be white (r_w and c_w), and the complementary subsets to be black (r_b and c_b), such that r_w × c_w are white, r_b × c_b are black, and the rest are empty.
but to satisfy maximality, the union of r_w ∪ r_b and c_w ∪ c_b must be the entire grid.
wait, no.
if r_w ∪ r_b is all rows, and c_w ∪ c_b is all columns, then the union covers everything, but in that case, r_b and c_b would be the complements of r_w and c_w.
therefore, the white region is r_w × c_w, and the black region is the complement of r_w × c_w in the grid?
no, not exactly.
the black region is (r \ r_w) × (c \ c_w), assuming r_b = r \ r_w and c_b = c \ c_w.
therefore, the grid is divided into four parts:
- r_w × c_w: white
- r_w × c_b: empty
- r_b × c_w: empty
- r_b × c_b: black
but if r_w ∪ r_b = all rows and c_w ∪ c_b = all columns, then the entire grid is covered by white, black, and empty cells as above.
however, in this case, the maximality condition is that every empty cell (which are in r_w × c_b and r_b × c_w) is in a row or column that is already entirely filled.
but in this setup, r_w and r_b are all rows, so every row is either entirely white or entirely black.
similarly, every column is entirely white or black.
but in reality, if a cell is empty, it's because it's in r_w × c_b or r_b × c_w.
for example, a cell in r_w × c_b: its row is white, its column is black, so it's empty.
but the row is filled (all white), so the cell is in a filled row.
similarly, the column is filled (all black), but the cell is empty because it's at the intersection of a white row and black column.
however, according to the maximality condition, adding a chip there would violate the color conditions.
but actually, if you try to add a white chip, the column is black, which conflicts.
if you add a black chip, the row is white, which conflicts.
therefore, the cell must remain empty.
therefore, such a grid is maximal.
therefore, these grids are determined by choosing a subset of rows to be white (and the rest black) and a subset of columns to be white (and the rest black), such that all white rows and all white columns are non-empty.
wait, not necessarily.
if you have a white row with a black column, the intersection is empty.
but if the white row has at least one white column, then it's non-empty.
similarly for white columns.
but the maximality requires that you can't add any more chips.
therefore, perhaps all white rows must be completely filled with white columns, and all black rows must be completely filled with black columns.
but this seems similar to the previous structure.
therefore, the number of such maximal grids is equal to the number of ways to choose subsets of rows and columns, each colored white or black, such that the colorings are consistent and maximal.
but more formally, for each possible k and m, where k is the number of white rows and m is the number of white columns, we can have a white rectangle of k×m, and then the rest determined.
but to satisfy maximality, the projections of the white and black rectangles must cover all rows and columns.
wait, but in order to cover all rows and columns, we must have that the white rows plus black rows equal all rows, and same for columns.
therefore, for each possible pair (k, m), where k rows are white and 5 - k rows are black, and m columns are white and 5 - m columns are black, we can have the white rectangle k×m and black rectangle (5 - k)×(5 - m).
but then, the empty cells would be k×(5 - m) and (5 - k)×m.
for the grid to be maximal, these empty cells must be covered by the union of white and black rows and columns.
wait, but if a cell is in a white row and black column (part of the k×(5 - m) empty cells), then it's in a white row (which is filled with white chips in columns 1 to m) and a black column (which is filled with black chips in rows k+1 to 5).
therefore
