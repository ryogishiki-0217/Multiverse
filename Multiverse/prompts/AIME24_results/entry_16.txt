<Think>
Okay, so I need to solve this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own.
Let me try to break it down step by step.
The problem states there are 900 residents in total.
Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, which means everyone has that.
Then there are three other items mentioned: diamond rings, sets of golf clubs, and garden spades.
The numbers given for each are:
- Diamond rings: 195 owners
- Golf clubs: 367 owners
- Garden spades: 562 owners
Also, each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's 900 owners.
Additionally, 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents own exactly three of these things.
The question is asking for the number of residents who own all four of these things.
Hmm, this seems like a problem that can be solved using the principle of inclusion-exclusion.
Let me recall how that works.
Inclusion-exclusion principle is used to count the number of elements in the union of multiple sets by adding the sizes of the individual sets, subtracting the sizes of their pairwise intersections, adding back the sizes of the triple intersections, and so on.
But here, we're given information about the number of people who own exactly two items and exactly three items.
So maybe I need to use that to find the number of people who own all four.
First, let me define the sets:
Let me denote:
- C as the set of residents who own candy hearts (size |C| = 900)
- D as the set of residents who own a diamond ring (size |D| = 195)
- G as the set of residents who own a set of golf clubs (size |G| = 367)
- S as the set of residents who own a garden spade (size |S| = 562)
We need to find the number of residents who own all four: |C ∩ D ∩ G ∩ S|.
But since every resident owns a bag of candy hearts, C is the entire universe here, right?
Because there are 900 residents and all 900 own candy hearts.
So actually, all intersections with C are just the intersections of the other sets.
Wait, but that might be trivial then.
Let me think.
If everyone owns C, then the number of people who own, say, D and C is just the number of people who own D, since owning C is universal.
So when they say 437 residents own exactly two of these things, those would be the people who own exactly two items including C.
Similarly, those who own exactly three items would be those who own C and one other item.
Wait, hold on.
Wait, actually, each resident owns at least one thing, since everyone has a bag of candy hearts.
But the problem is about residents owning multiple things.
So perhaps the total number of residents is 900, each owns at least one thing (the candy hearts).
Then some own additional items.
The counts for diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades are the numbers of owners for those items.
The key here is that 437 own exactly two things (could be C and one other, or two others including C? Wait, but since everyone has C, if they own exactly two things, that must be C and one other.
But can they own two others plus C?
Wait, if someone owns exactly three things, that would be C and two others, right?
Similarly, people who own exactly four things own C and the other three items.
So maybe the problem is structured such that:
- Everyone owns C.
- Some own only C (maybe 900 minus those who own two, three, or four things).
- Then 437 own exactly two things: C plus one other.
- 234 own exactly three things: C plus two others.
- And the question is how many own all four: C plus the three others.
Wait, but the problem gives the counts for D, G, and S.
Let me check.
The number of owners for each item:
- D: 195
But since everyone who owns D also owns C (except if D's count already excludes C, but no, the problem says "who own a diamond ring".
So the 195 people who own diamond rings, in addition to the universal candy hearts.
Wait, no.
Wait, the problem states "there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade".
But since each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts, does that mean that these counts (195, 367, 562) are in addition to the candy hearts?
Wait, no, probably not.
Wait, let me re-read the problem.
"Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things."
Wait, so the total residents are 900.
Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts.
So the counts for diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades include those who also own candy hearts, right?
So the 195 people who own diamond rings include those who only own the diamond ring and candy hearts, those who own diamond ring and one other item, etc.
Similarly for golf clubs and garden spades.
So the total number of owners for each item is given, and these can be used in inclusion-exclusion.
But the key here is that everyone owns at least one item (the candy hearts).
Some own exactly one (C only), some exactly two (C and one other, or two others including C?), some exactly three (C and two others, or three others including C?), and some exactly four (all four).
Wait, but since everyone owns C, if someone owns exactly two items, it's C and one other.
Similarly, those who own exactly three items own C and two others.
Those who own all four own C and the three other items.
So in that case, the problem reduces to how many people own 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 items, where owning 1 item means owning only C, but since C is universal, the minimum is 1.
Wait, but the problem says "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts".
So everyone has at least one item.
Then the problem mentions 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, which would be C and one other specific item.
Similarly, 234 residents who own exactly three of these things, meaning C and two other specific items.
And we need to find the number of residents who own all four.
So the total population is 900.
Let me denote:
Let x be the number of people who own all four items.
We need to find x.
Let me think about the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets.
The formula for the union of four sets is:
|A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |A ∩ D| - |B ∩ C| - |B ∩ D| - |C ∩ D| + |A ∩ B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ D| + |A ∩ C ∩ D| + |B ∩ C ∩ D| - |A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D|
But in our case, the universal set is 900, and everyone is in at least one set (since everyone owns a bag of candy hearts).
Therefore, |A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = 900.
However, the four sets would be C (candy hearts), D (diamond rings), G (golf clubs), S (garden spades).
Wait, but actually, since everyone owns candy hearts, set C is the universal set here.
Therefore, the union of all four sets is 900.
But perhaps we can model it with three sets (D, G, S) over the universe C of 900.
But the problem gives numbers of people owning exactly two things, exactly three things, etc.
Let me see.
Wait, perhaps it's easier to use the inclusion-exclusion principle on the three non-universal sets.
Wait, but since everyone is in C, then the number of people in C is 900.
But if we consider ownership of D, G, S over the universe C, then the counts are:
- |D| = 195
- |G| = 367
- |S| = 562
Then the number of people who own exactly two items would be those in exactly two of the sets D, G, S, or those in C and exactly one other?
Wait, since everyone is in C, owning exactly two things would mean owning C and one other, which is equivalent to being in exactly one of D, G, S.
Similarly, owning exactly three things would mean owning C and two others, which is being in exactly two of D, G, S.
And owning all four would mean being in all three of D, G, S.
Wait!
That's probably the key insight here.
Let me formalize that.
Let me define:
Let U be the universal set of 900 residents.
Let C be the set of residents who own candy hearts, with |C| = 900.
Let D, G, S be the sets of residents who own diamond rings, golf clubs, garden spades, respectively.
So |D| = 195, |G| = 367, |S| = 562.
Now, the number of residents who own exactly two things is 437.
But since everyone owns C, owning exactly two things must mean owning C and one other item, which translates to being in exactly one of D, G, S.
Similarly, residents who own exactly three things (234 residents) must own C and two other items, which translates to being in exactly two of D, G, S.
Residents who own all four items are those in D ∩ G ∩ S, since everyone already has C.
Therefore, if we can apply inclusion-exclusion on the three sets D, G, S, we can find the number of people in all three, which is our answer.
First, let's note that the total number of residents is 900.
Each resident is in C, and may be in D, G, S as well.
The counts for D, G, S are the numbers of residents in each respective set.
The number of residents who own exactly two things (i.e., in exactly one of D, G, S) is 437.
The number of residents who own exactly three things (i.e., in exactly two of D, G, S) is 234.
The number of residents who own four things (i.e., in all three of D, G, S) is what we need to find, x.
Additionally, there are residents who own only C and none of D, G, S.
Let me denote the number of such residents as N.
So, N = |C| - |D ∪ G ∪ S|.
But since |C| = 900, we have N = 900 - |D ∪ G ∪ S|.
But let's think in terms of inclusion-exclusion for the three sets D, G, S.
The formula is:
|D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| - |G ∩ S| + |D ∩ G ∩ S|
Let’s denote |D ∩ G ∩ S| as x, which is the quantity we need to find.
Let’s also denote the number of people who own exactly one item (other than C) as A, exactly two items (other than C) as B, and exactly three items (other than C) as x.
Wait, no.
Actually, the number of people who own exactly two things (including C) is 437, which corresponds to exactly one item among D, G, S.
Similarly, the number of people who own exactly three things (including C) is 234, which corresponds to exactly two items among D, G, S.
And the number of people who own all four things is the number of people who have all three items D, G, S, which is x.
Also, the number of people who own only C is N = 900 - |D ∪ G ∪ S|.
Now, using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can relate the counts.
First, let's note that the number of people who own exactly one item (D, G, or S) is 437.
Similarly, the number of people who own exactly two items (D, G, S) is 234, and those who own all three are x.
Therefore, the total in |D ∪ G ∪ S| is the sum of:
- Only D: part of A
- Only G: part of A
- Only S: part of A
- Exactly two: D and G, D and S, G and S: total 234
- All three: x
Therefore, |D ∪ G ∪ S| = (number with exactly one) + (number with exactly two) + (number with all three) = 437 + 234 + x.
But also, |D ∪ G ∪ S| can be computed via inclusion-exclusion as above.
So let's compute |D ∪ G ∪ S| in two ways.
First, from the problem data:
Total residents = 900 = N (only C) + 437 (exactly two things, i.e., exactly one of D, G, S) + 234 (exactly three things, i.e., exactly two of D, G, S) + x (all four things, i.e., all three of D, G, S).
Therefore:
900 = N + 437 + 234 + x
Which simplifies to:
900 = N + 671 + x
Therefore:
N = 900 - 671 - x = 229 - x
But also, N is equal to 900 - |D ∪ G ∪ S|.
So:
N = 900 - |D ∪ G ∪ S|
But |D ∪ G ∪ S| = 437 + 234 + x = 671 + x
Therefore:
N = 900 - (671 + x) = 229 - x
Which matches the previous expression.
Now, let's use inclusion-exclusion to compute |D ∪ G ∪ S| in terms of the given individual set sizes and intersections.
Given:
|D| = 195, |G| = 367, |S| = 562
So:
|D ∪ G ∪ S| = 195 + 367 + 562 - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| - |G ∩ S| + x
We also know that |D ∪ G ∪ S| = 671 + x
Therefore:
195 + 367 + 562 - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| - |G ∩ S| + x = 671 + x
Simplifying both sides:
(195 + 367 + 562) - (|D ∩ G| + |D ∩ S| + |G ∩ S|) + x = 671 + x
Subtract x from both sides:
195 + 367 + 562 - (|D ∩ G| + |D ∩ S| + |G ∩ S|) = 671
Calculate the total of |D| + |G| + |S|:
195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124
Wait, 195+367 is 562?
Wait, 195 + 367:
195 + 300 = 495; 495 + 67 = 562.
So yes, 195 + 367 = 562.
Then 562 + 562 = 1124.
So:
1124 - (|D ∩ G| + |D ∩ S| + |G ∩ S|) = 671
Therefore:
|D ∩ G| + |D ∩ S| + |G ∩ S| = 1124 - 671 = 453
So the sum of the pairwise intersections is 453.
But we can express each pairwise intersection in terms of the numbers given (the 437 and 234).
Let me recall that in the breakdown of the union, the number of people in exactly one set is 437, exactly two sets is 234, and all three sets is x.
The formula for the union size is 437 + 234 + x = 671 + x.
But let's look at the standard inclusion-exclusion formula again:
|D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| - |G ∩ S| + x
But we already derived that |D ∪ G ∪ S| = 671 + x.
Therefore, substituting:
671 + x = (|D| + |G| + |S|) - (|D ∩ G| + |D ∩ S| + |G ∩ S|) + x
Subtract x from both sides:
671 = (1124) - (|D ∩ G| + |D ∩ S| + |G ∩ S|)
Thus, |D ∩ G| + |D ∩ S| + |G ∩ S| = 1124 - 671 = 453.
So the sum of the sizes of the pairwise intersections is 453.
But we can relate this to the number of people in exactly two sets and those in all three sets.
Each pairwise intersection |D ∩ G| includes people who are in both D and G but may or may not be in S.
Similarly, within each pairwise intersection, we have those who are only in D and G but not in S, those who are in D and G and S.
So:
|D ∩ G| = (number of people in D and G but not S) + x
Similarly for the other pairwise intersections.
Therefore:
|D ∩ G| + |D ∩ S| + |G ∩ S| = [ (D ∩ G \ S) ∪ (D ∩ S \ G) ∪ (G ∩ S \ D) ) ] + 3x
But the number of people in exactly two sets is 234.
Therefore, the total of (D ∩ G \ S) + (D ∩ S \ G) + (G ∩ S \ D) ) is 234.
Therefore:
|D ∩ G| + |D ∩ S| + |G ∩ S| = 234 + 3x
But we already found that |D ∩ G| + |D ∩ S| + |G ∩ S| = 453.
Therefore:
234 + 3x = 453
Solving for x:
3x = 453 - 234 = 219
Therefore:
x = 219 / 3 = 73
Therefore, the number of residents who own all four things is 73.
Let me verify if this makes sense.
So x is 73.
Therefore, the pairwise intersections each include this x value.
Let me check the numbers.
If x = 73, then |D ∩ G| + |D ∩ S| + |G ∩ S| = 234 + 3*73 = 234 + 219 = 453, which matches our previous result.
Additionally, let's check the individual numbers.
Let's take |D| = 195.
This includes:
- Only D: part of the 437 who have exactly one item.
- D and one other: part of the 234 who have exactly two items.
- D and two others: part of the 73 who have all three.
So:
|D| = (Only D) + (D and one other) + (D and two others)
= (part of 437) + (part of 234) + 73
Similarly for |G| and |S|.
But perhaps we can compute the number of people only in D, only in G, only in S.
Let’s denote:
- a = number of people only in D: so a = |D| - (D and one other) - (D and two others) = 195 - [number in D and one other] - 73
But the number in D and one other is the number of people in exactly two sets (D and one other), which is part of the 234.
Similarly, we can denote:
Let’s denote:
Let b = number of people in D and G but not S
c = number of people in D and S but not G
d = number of people in G and S but not D
So b + c + d = 234
And the number of people in all three is x = 73.
Then, the size of each pairwise intersection is:
|D ∩ G| = b + x = b + 73
|D ∩ S| = c + x = c + 73
|G ∩ S| = d + x = d + 73
Thus, sum of pairwise intersections is (b + 73) + (c + 73) + (d + 73) = (b + c + d) + 3*73 = 234 + 219 = 453, which matches.
Each individual set size is:
|D| = a + (b + c) + x
Wait, no.
Wait, let's parse |D|.
The people who are in D are:
- Those who have only D: a
- Those who have D and G but not S: b
- Those who have D and S but not G: c
- Those who have D and G and S: x
Similarly, |D| = a + b + c + x
Similarly, |G| = (similarly defined components) and |S| = ...
Therefore:
For |D| = a + b + c + x = 195
Similarly, |G| = (components) = d + b + e + x = 367
Wait, maybe I need to define variables for all parts.
Let me define:
a = |D| only
b = |D ∩ G \ S|
c = |D ∩ S \ G|
d = |G ∩ S \ D|
e = |only G|
f = |only S|
x = |D ∩ G ∩ S| = 73 (as we found)
Then, the total for each set is:
|D| = a + b + c + x = 195
|G| = e + b + d + x = 367
|S| = f + c + d + x = 562
We also know that:
The number of people with exactly one item (other than C) is a + e + f = 437
The number of people with exactly two items (other than C) is b + c + d = 234
The number of people with exactly three items (other than C) is x = 73
The number of people with only C is N = 229 - x = 229 - 73 = 156
Therefore, the total population is:
N + a + e + f + b + c + d + x = 156 + 437 + 234 + 73 = 900.
Correct.
So now, to verify the numbers.
Given that:
a + e + f = 437
b + c + d = 234
x = 73
N = 156
Let's compute |D|, |G|, |S|.
For |D|:
a + b + c + x = (a + e + f) - e - f + b + c + x + (e + f - e - f)
Wait, perhaps not the right approach.
Wait, |D| = a + b + c + x = (a) + (b) + (c) + (x)
But from the given data:
a + e + f = 437
But we don't have individual values for a, e, f.
However, we can write equations:
From |D| = a + b + c + x = 195
But we need to express this in terms of known quantities.
Similarly, |G| = e + b + d + x = 367
|S| = f + c + d + x = 562
We know that:
a + e + f = 437
b + c + d = 234
x = 73
So, let's solve for variables.
Let me denote S1 = a + e + f = 437
Equations for each set:
1) a + b + c + 73 = 195 → a + b + c = 195 - 73 = 122
2) e + b + d + 73 = 367 → e + b + d = 367 - 73 = 294
3) f + c + d + 73 = 562 → f + c + d = 562 - 73 = 489
We also know that:
b + c + d = 234
From equation 1: a + b + c = 122 → a = 122 - b - c
From equation 2: e + b + d = 294
From equation 3: f + c + d = 489
And we have S1: a + e + f = 437
Substituting a from equation 1 into S1:
(122 - b - c) + e + f = 437 → e + f = 437 - 122 + b + c = 315 + b + c
From equation 2: e = 294 - b - d
From equation 3: f = 489 - c - d
Therefore:
e + f = (294 - b - d) + (489 - c - d) = 783 - b - c - 2d
But from the above, e + f = 315 + b + c
Therefore:
783 - b - c - 2d = 315 + b + c
Rearranging:
783 - 315 = 2b + 2c + 2d
468 = 2(b + c + d) + 2d
But b + c + d = 234
So:
468 = 2(234) + 2d
468 = 468 + 2d
Therefore, 2d = 0 ⇒ d = 0
Wait, that's interesting.
So d = 0.
Therefore, there are no residents in G ∩ S \ D.
That is, anyone who owns both G and S also owns D.
Hence, all the people who own both golf clubs and spades also own a diamond ring.
That seems a bit odd, but maybe possible.
Let me proceed.
If d = 0, then from equation 3:
f + c + d = 489 ⇒ f + c = 489
But since d = 0, then equation 2 becomes:
e + b + 0 + 73 = 367 ⇒ e + b = 294
Similarly, equation 1: a + b + c = 122
And equation for S1: a + e + f = 437
We have:
From d = 0, f + c = 489
From equation 1: a + b + c = 122
From equation modified S1: e + f = 315 + b + c (since e + f = 315 + b + c as per earlier)
But since f + c = 489, then:
e + f = e + (489 - c) = e + 489 - c = 315 + b + c
But this might not be helpful.
Let me try substituting variables.
Given d = 0, let's express variables in terms of c.
Since f + c = 489, then f = 489 - c.
Similarly, from equation 1: a = 122 - b - c
From equation 2: e = 294 - b
From S1: a + e + f = (122 - b - c) + (294 - b) + (489 - c) = 122 + 294 + 489 - 2b - 2c = 905 - 2(b + c) = 437
Therefore:
905 - 2(b + c) = 437
So:
2(b + c) = 905 - 437 = 468
Thus:
b + c = 234
But we also have from equation 1: a + b + c = 122, so a = 122 - (b + c) = 122 - 234 = -112
Wait, this can't be possible.
a can't be negative.
That means something is wrong here.
Wait, but this suggests that my assumption or calculation is incorrect.
Wait, but how did we get here.
So if we have:
From equation 1: a = 122 - b - c
If b + c = 234, then a = 122 - 234 = -112.
Which is impossible.
Therefore, there is a contradiction here, which suggests that either our initial assumption is wrong or perhaps miscalculations were made.
Wait, but earlier we found x = 73, and using that we derived d = 0, leading to this contradiction.
Wait, but how did we get d = 0?
Let me check the steps again.
After finding x = 73, we had equations:
From |S|: f + c + d = 489
From the fact that b + c + d = 234 (since exactly two items: b + c + d = 234)
Then in the inclusion-exclusion, we found that sum of pairwise intersections |D ∩ G| + |D ∩ S| + |G ∩ S| = 453, which with x=73 gives (b + x) + (c +x ) + (d +x ) = (b + c + d) + 3x = 234 + 3*73 = 234 + 219 = 453.
Correct.
But when we tried to solve for individual variables, assuming that:
|D| = a + b + c + x = 195
Which gives a + b + c = 195 - 73 = 122
Similarly for |G|: e + b + d = 294
And |S|: f + c + d = 489
And we know that a + e + f = 437
But when we tried to solve, we had:
Equation1: a = 122 - b - c
EquationS1: a + e + f = 437
Substitute a: 122 - b - c + e + f = 437 ⇒ e + f = 437 - 122 + b + c = 315 + b + c
But from e = 294 - b - d (from |G| equation: e + b + d = 294 ⇒ e = 294 - b - d)
And f = 489 - c - d (from |S| equation: f + c + d = 489 ⇒ f = 489 - c - d)
Therefore:
e + f = (294 - b - d) + (489 - c - d) = 783 - b - c - 2d
But we also have e + f = 315 + b + c
Therefore:
783 - b - c - 2d = 315 + b + c
Simplify:
783 - 315 = b + c + 2d + b + c
468 = 2b + 2c + 2d
Divide by 2:
234 = b + c + d
But we already know that b + c + d = 234 (exactly two items).
So 234 = 234.
This is an identity, so it gives no new information.
Therefore, my previous step where I solved for d was incorrect.
So in reality, when I thought I found d = 0, that was due to a mistake.
Actually, the equation 468 = 2*(b + c + d) => 234 = b + c + d, which we already knew.
Therefore, my conclusion that d = 0 was wrong.
Therefore, we can't determine d from these equations.
Therefore, my mistake was thinking that d = 0.
Therefore, maybe the value of x=73 is correct, but my subsequent checks were flawed.
Therefore, perhaps x=73 is correct, and the problem is solvable with that answer.
Let me cross-verify.
Total people in D, G, S unions:
As per earlier, |D ∪ G ∪ S| = 671 + x = 671 + 73 = 744
Then, N = 900 - 744 = 156, which is consistent.
Then verify inclusion-exclusion:
|D| + |G| + |S| = 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124
Sum of pairwise intersections: |D ∩ G| + |D ∩ S| + |G ∩ S| = 453
Then |D ∪ G ∪ S| = 1124 - 453 + x = 1124 - 453 + 73 = 1124 - 453 is 671, 671 +73=744, which matches.
Therefore, all the numbers check out.
Therefore, the answer x=73 is correct.
Therefore, despite not being able to solve for all individual variables, the principle of inclusion-exclusion holds with x=73, and the answer is correct.
**Final Answer**
\boxed{73}

<think>
okay, so i need to solve this problem about residents in aimeville and the things they own.
let me try to break it down step by step.
the problem states there are 900 residents in total.
each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, which means everyone has that.
then there are three other items mentioned: diamond rings, sets of golf clubs, and garden spades.
the numbers given for each are:
- diamond rings: 195 owners
- golf clubs: 367 owners
- garden spades: 562 owners
also, each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's 900 owners.
additionally, 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents own exactly three of these things.
the question is asking for the number of residents who own all four of these things.
hmm, this seems like a problem that can be solved using the principle of inclusion-exclusion.
let me recall how that works.
inclusion-exclusion principle is used to count the number of elements in the union of multiple sets by adding the sizes of the individual sets, subtracting the sizes of their pairwise intersections, adding back the sizes of the triple intersections, and so on.
but here, we're given information about the number of people who own exactly two items and exactly three items.
so maybe i need to use that to find the number of people who own all four.
first, let me define the sets:
let me denote:
- c as the set of residents who own candy hearts (size |c| = 900)
- d as the set of residents who own a diamond ring (size |d| = 195)
- g as the set of residents who own a set of golf clubs (size |g| = 367)
- s as the set of residents who own a garden spade (size |s| = 562)
we need to find the number of residents who own all four: |c ∩ d ∩ g ∩ s|.
but since every resident owns a bag of candy hearts, c is the entire universe here, right?
because there are 900 residents and all 900 own candy hearts.
so actually, all intersections with c are just the intersections of the other sets.
wait, but that might be trivial then.
let me think.
if everyone owns c, then the number of people who own, say, d and c is just the number of people who own d, since owning c is universal.
so when they say 437 residents own exactly two of these things, those would be the people who own exactly two items including c.
similarly, those who own exactly three items would be those who own c and one other item.
wait, hold on.
wait, actually, each resident owns at least one thing, since everyone has a bag of candy hearts.
but the problem is about residents owning multiple things.
so perhaps the total number of residents is 900, each owns at least one thing (the candy hearts).
then some own additional items.
the counts for diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades are the numbers of owners for those items.
the key here is that 437 own exactly two things (could be c and one other, or two others including c? wait, but since everyone has c, if they own exactly two things, that must be c and one other.
but can they own two others plus c?
wait, if someone owns exactly three things, that would be c and two others, right?
similarly, people who own exactly four things own c and the other three items.
so maybe the problem is structured such that:
- everyone owns c.
- some own only c (maybe 900 minus those who own two, three, or four things).
- then 437 own exactly two things: c plus one other.
- 234 own exactly three things: c plus two others.
- and the question is how many own all four: c plus the three others.
wait, but the problem gives the counts for d, g, and s.
let me check.
the number of owners for each item:
- d: 195
but since everyone who owns d also owns c (except if d's count already excludes c, but no, the problem says "who own a diamond ring".
so the 195 people who own diamond rings, in addition to the universal candy hearts.
wait, no.
wait, the problem states "there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade".
but since each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts, does that mean that these counts (195, 367, 562) are in addition to the candy hearts?
wait, no, probably not.
wait, let me re-read the problem.
"among the 900 residents of aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. in addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. find the number of residents of aimeville who own all four of these things."
wait, so the total residents are 900.
each resident owns a bag of candy hearts.
so the counts for diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades include those who also own candy hearts, right?
so the 195 people who own diamond rings include those who only own the diamond ring and candy hearts, those who own diamond ring and one other item, etc.
similarly for golf clubs and garden spades.
so the total number of owners for each item is given, and these can be used in inclusion-exclusion.
but the key here is that everyone owns at least one item (the candy hearts).
some own exactly one (c only), some exactly two (c and one other, or two others including c?), some exactly three (c and two others, or three others including c?), and some exactly four (all four).
wait, but since everyone owns c, if someone owns exactly two items, it's c and one other.
similarly, those who own exactly three items own c and two others.
those who own all four own c and the three other items.
so in that case, the problem reduces to how many people own 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 items, where owning 1 item means owning only c, but since c is universal, the minimum is 1.
wait, but the problem says "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts".
so everyone has at least one item.
then the problem mentions 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, which would be c and one other specific item.
similarly, 234 residents who own exactly three of these things, meaning c and two other specific items.
and we need to find the number of residents who own all four.
so the total population is 900.
let me denote:
let x be the number of people who own all four items.
we need to find x.
let me think about the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets.
the formula for the union of four sets is:
|a ∪ b ∪ c ∪ d| = |a| + |b| + |c| + |d| - |a ∩ b| - |a ∩ c| - |a ∩ d| - |b ∩ c| - |b ∩ d| - |c ∩ d| + |a ∩ b ∩ c| + |a ∩ b ∩ d| + |a ∩ c ∩ d| + |b ∩ c ∩ d| - |a ∩ b ∩ c ∩ d|
but in our case, the universal set is 900, and everyone is in at least one set (since everyone owns a bag of candy hearts).
therefore, |a ∪ b ∪ c ∪ d| = 900.
however, the four sets would be c (candy hearts), d (diamond rings), g (golf clubs), s (garden spades).
wait, but actually, since everyone owns candy hearts, set c is the universal set here.
therefore, the union of all four sets is 900.
but perhaps we can model it with three sets (d, g, s) over the universe c of 900.
but the problem gives numbers of people owning exactly two things, exactly three things, etc.
let me see.
wait, perhaps it's easier to use the inclusion-exclusion principle on the three non-universal sets.
wait, but since everyone is in c, then the number of people in c is 900.
but if we consider ownership of d, g, s over the universe c, then the counts are:
- |d| = 195
- |g| = 367
- |s| = 562
then the number of people who own exactly two items would be those in exactly two of the sets d, g, s, or those in c and exactly one other?
wait, since everyone is in c, owning exactly two things would mean owning c and one other, which is equivalent to being in exactly one of d, g, s.
similarly, owning exactly three things would mean owning c and two others, which is being in exactly two of d, g, s.
and owning all four would mean being in all three of d, g, s.
wait!
that's probably the key insight here.
let me formalize that.
let me define:
let u be the universal set of 900 residents.
let c be the set of residents who own candy hearts, with |c| = 900.
let d, g, s be the sets of residents who own diamond rings, golf clubs, garden spades, respectively.
so |d| = 195, |g| = 367, |s| = 562.
now, the number of residents who own exactly two things is 437.
but since everyone owns c, owning exactly two things must mean owning c and one other item, which translates to being in exactly one of d, g, s.
similarly, residents who own exactly three things (234 residents) must own c and two other items, which translates to being in exactly two of d, g, s.
residents who own all four items are those in d ∩ g ∩ s, since everyone already has c.
therefore, if we can apply inclusion-exclusion on the three sets d, g, s, we can find the number of people in all three, which is our answer.
first, let's note that the total number of residents is 900.
each resident is in c, and may be in d, g, s as well.
the counts for d, g, s are the numbers of residents in each respective set.
the number of residents who own exactly two things (i.e., in exactly one of d, g, s) is 437.
the number of residents who own exactly three things (i.e., in exactly two of d, g, s) is 234.
the number of residents who own four things (i.e., in all three of d, g, s) is what we need to find, x.
additionally, there are residents who own only c and none of d, g, s.
let me denote the number of such residents as n.
so, n = |c| - |d ∪ g ∪ s|.
but since |c| = 900, we have n = 900 - |d ∪ g ∪ s|.
but let's think in terms of inclusion-exclusion for the three sets d, g, s.
the formula is:
|d ∪ g ∪ s| = |d| + |g| + |s| - |d ∩ g| - |d ∩ s| - |g ∩ s| + |d ∩ g ∩ s|
let’s denote |d ∩ g ∩ s| as x, which is the quantity we need to find.
let’s also denote the number of people who own exactly one item (other than c) as a, exactly two items (other than c) as b, and exactly three items (other than c) as x.
wait, no.
actually, the number of people who own exactly two things (including c) is 437, which corresponds to exactly one item among d, g, s.
similarly, the number of people who own exactly three things (including c) is 234, which corresponds to exactly two items among d, g, s.
and the number of people who own all four things is the number of people who have all three items d, g, s, which is x.
also, the number of people who own only c is n = 900 - |d ∪ g ∪ s|.
now, using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can relate the counts.
first, let's note that the number of people who own exactly one item (d, g, or s) is 437.
similarly, the number of people who own exactly two items (d, g, s) is 234, and those who own all three are x.
therefore, the total in |d ∪ g ∪ s| is the sum of:
- only d: part of a
- only g: part of a
- only s: part of a
- exactly two: d and g, d and s, g and s: total 234
- all three: x
therefore, |d ∪ g ∪ s| = (number with exactly one) + (number with exactly two) + (number with all three) = 437 + 234 + x.
but also, |d ∪ g ∪ s| can be computed via inclusion-exclusion as above.
so let's compute |d ∪ g ∪ s| in two ways.
first, from the problem data:
total residents = 900 = n (only c) + 437 (exactly two things, i.e., exactly one of d, g, s) + 234 (exactly three things, i.e., exactly two of d, g, s) + x (all four things, i.e., all three of d, g, s).
therefore:
900 = n + 437 + 234 + x
which simplifies to:
900 = n + 671 + x
therefore:
n = 900 - 671 - x = 229 - x
but also, n is equal to 900 - |d ∪ g ∪ s|.
so:
n = 900 - |d ∪ g ∪ s|
but |d ∪ g ∪ s| = 437 + 234 + x = 671 + x
therefore:
n = 900 - (671 + x) = 229 - x
which matches the previous expression.
now, let's use inclusion-exclusion to compute |d ∪ g ∪ s| in terms of the given individual set sizes and intersections.
given:
|d| = 195, |g| = 367, |s| = 562
so:
|d ∪ g ∪ s| = 195 + 367 + 562 - |d ∩ g| - |d ∩ s| - |g ∩ s| + x
we also know that |d ∪ g ∪ s| = 671 + x
therefore:
195 + 367 + 562 - |d ∩ g| - |d ∩ s| - |g ∩ s| + x = 671 + x
simplifying both sides:
(195 + 367 + 562) - (|d ∩ g| + |d ∩ s| + |g ∩ s|) + x = 671 + x
subtract x from both sides:
195 + 367 + 562 - (|d ∩ g| + |d ∩ s| + |g ∩ s|) = 671
calculate the total of |d| + |g| + |s|:
195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124
wait, 195+367 is 562?
wait, 195 + 367:
195 + 300 = 495; 495 + 67 = 562.
so yes, 195 + 367 = 562.
then 562 + 562 = 1124.
so:
1124 - (|d ∩ g| + |d ∩ s| + |g ∩ s|) = 671
therefore:
|d ∩ g| + |d ∩ s| + |g ∩ s| = 1124 - 671 = 453
so the sum of the pairwise intersections is 453.
but we can express each pairwise intersection in terms of the numbers given (the 437 and 234).
let me recall that in the breakdown of the union, the number of people in exactly one set is 437, exactly two sets is 234, and all three sets is x.
the formula for the union size is 437 + 234 + x = 671 + x.
but let's look at the standard inclusion-exclusion formula again:
|d ∪ g ∪ s| = |d| + |g| + |s| - |d ∩ g| - |d ∩ s| - |g ∩ s| + x
but we already derived that |d ∪ g ∪ s| = 671 + x.
therefore, substituting:
671 + x = (|d| + |g| + |s|) - (|d ∩ g| + |d ∩ s| + |g ∩ s|) + x
subtract x from both sides:
671 = (1124) - (|d ∩ g| + |d ∩ s| + |g ∩ s|)
thus, |d ∩ g| + |d ∩ s| + |g ∩ s| = 1124 - 671 = 453.
so the sum of the sizes of the pairwise intersections is 453.
but we can relate this to the number of people in exactly two sets and those in all three sets.
each pairwise intersection |d ∩ g| includes people who are in both d and g but may or may not be in s.
similarly, within each pairwise intersection, we have those who are only in d and g but not in s, those who are in d and g and s.
so:
|d ∩ g| = (number of people in d and g but not s) + x
similarly for the other pairwise intersections.
therefore:
|d ∩ g| + |d ∩ s| + |g ∩ s| = [ (d ∩ g \ s) ∪ (d ∩ s \ g) ∪ (g ∩ s \ d) ) ] + 3x
but the number of people in exactly two sets is 234.
therefore, the total of (d ∩ g \ s) + (d ∩ s \ g) + (g ∩ s \ d) ) is 234.
therefore:
|d ∩ g| + |d ∩ s| + |g ∩ s| = 234 + 3x
but we already found that |d ∩ g| + |d ∩ s| + |g ∩ s| = 453.
therefore:
234 + 3x = 453
solving for x:
3x = 453 - 234 = 219
therefore:
x = 219 / 3 = 73
therefore, the number of residents who own all four things is 73.
let me verify if this makes sense.
so x is 73.
therefore, the pairwise intersections each include this x value.
let me check the numbers.
if x = 73, then |d ∩ g| + |d ∩ s| + |g ∩ s| = 234 + 3*73 = 234 + 219 = 453, which matches our previous result.
additionally, let's check the individual numbers.
let's take |d| = 195.
this includes:
- only d: part of the 437 who have exactly one item.
- d and one other: part of the 234 who have exactly two items.
- d and two others: part of the 73 who have all three.
so:
|d| = (only d) + (d and one other) + (d and two others)
= (part of 437) + (part of 234) + 73
similarly for |g| and |s|.
but perhaps we can compute the number of people only in d, only in g, only in s.
let’s denote:
- a = number of people only in d: so a = |d| - (d and one other) - (d and two others) = 195 - [number in d and one other] - 73
but the number in d and one other is the number of people in exactly two sets (d and one other), which is part of the 234.
similarly, we can denote:
let’s denote:
let b = number of people in d and g but not s
c = number of people in d and s but not g
d = number of people in g and s but not d
so b + c + d = 234
and the number of people in all three is x = 73.
then, the size of each pairwise intersection is:
|d ∩ g| = b + x = b + 73
|d ∩ s| = c + x = c + 73
|g ∩ s| = d + x = d + 73
thus, sum of pairwise intersections is (b + 73) + (c + 73) + (d + 73) = (b + c + d) + 3*73 = 234 + 219 = 453, which matches.
each individual set size is:
|d| = a + (b + c) + x
wait, no.
wait, let's parse |d|.
the people who are in d are:
- those who have only d: a
- those who have d and g but not s: b
- those who have d and s but not g: c
- those who have d and g and s: x
similarly, |d| = a + b + c + x
similarly, |g| = (similarly defined components) and |s| = ...
therefore:
for |d| = a + b + c + x = 195
similarly, |g| = (components) = d + b + e + x = 367
wait, maybe i need to define variables for all parts.
let me define:
a = |d| only
b = |d ∩ g \ s|
c = |d ∩ s \ g|
d = |g ∩ s \ d|
e = |only g|
f = |only s|
x = |d ∩ g ∩ s| = 73 (as we found)
then, the total for each set is:
|d| = a + b + c + x = 195
|g| = e + b + d + x = 367
|s| = f + c + d + x = 562
we also know that:
the number of people with exactly one item (other than c) is a + e + f = 437
the number of people with exactly two items (other than c) is b + c + d = 234
the number of people with exactly three items (other than c) is x = 73
the number of people with only c is n = 229 - x = 229 - 73 = 156
therefore, the total population is:
n + a + e + f + b + c + d + x = 156 + 437 + 234 + 73 = 900.
correct.
so now, to verify the numbers.
given that:
a + e + f = 437
b + c + d = 234
x = 73
n = 156
let's compute |d|, |g|, |s|.
for |d|:
a + b + c + x = (a + e + f) - e - f + b + c + x + (e + f - e - f)
wait, perhaps not the right approach.
wait, |d| = a + b + c + x = (a) + (b) + (c) + (x)
but from the given data:
a + e + f = 437
but we don't have individual values for a, e, f.
however, we can write equations:
from |d| = a + b + c + x = 195
but we need to express this in terms of known quantities.
similarly, |g| = e + b + d + x = 367
|s| = f + c + d + x = 562
we know that:
a + e + f = 437
b + c + d = 234
x = 73
so, let's solve for variables.
let me denote s1 = a + e + f = 437
equations for each set:
1) a + b + c + 73 = 195 → a + b + c = 195 - 73 = 122
2) e + b + d + 73 = 367 → e + b + d = 367 - 73 = 294
3) f + c + d + 73 = 562 → f + c + d = 562 - 73 = 489
we also know that:
b + c + d = 234
from equation 1: a + b + c = 122 → a = 122 - b - c
from equation 2: e + b + d = 294
from equation 3: f + c + d = 489
and we have s1: a + e + f = 437
substituting a from equation 1 into s1:
(122 - b - c) + e + f = 437 → e + f = 437 - 122 + b + c = 315 + b + c
from equation 2: e = 294 - b - d
from equation 3: f = 489 - c - d
therefore:
e + f = (294 - b - d) + (489 - c - d) = 783 - b - c - 2d
but from the above, e + f = 315 + b + c
therefore:
783 - b - c - 2d = 315 + b + c
rearranging:
783 - 315 = 2b + 2c + 2d
468 = 2(b + c + d) + 2d
but b + c + d = 234
so:
468 = 2(234) + 2d
468 = 468 + 2d
therefore, 2d = 0 ⇒ d = 0
wait, that's interesting.
so d = 0.
therefore, there are no residents in g ∩ s \ d.
that is, anyone who owns both g and s also owns d.
hence, all the people who own both golf clubs and spades also own a diamond ring.
that seems a bit odd, but maybe possible.
let me proceed.
if d = 0, then from equation 3:
f + c + d = 489 ⇒ f + c = 489
but since d = 0, then equation 2 becomes:
e + b + 0 + 73 = 367 ⇒ e + b = 294
similarly, equation 1: a + b + c = 122
and equation for s1: a + e + f = 437
we have:
from d = 0, f + c = 489
from equation 1: a + b + c = 122
from equation modified s1: e + f = 315 + b + c (since e + f = 315 + b + c as per earlier)
but since f + c = 489, then:
e + f = e + (489 - c) = e + 489 - c = 315 + b + c
but this might not be helpful.
let me try substituting variables.
given d = 0, let's express variables in terms of c.
since f + c = 489, then f = 489 - c.
similarly, from equation 1: a = 122 - b - c
from equation 2: e = 294 - b
from s1: a + e + f = (122 - b - c) + (294 - b) + (489 - c) = 122 + 294 + 489 - 2b - 2c = 905 - 2(b + c) = 437
therefore:
905 - 2(b + c) = 437
so:
2(b + c) = 905 - 437 = 468
thus:
b + c = 234
but we also have from equation 1: a + b + c = 122, so a = 122 - (b + c) = 122 - 234 = -112
wait, this can't be possible.
a can't be negative.
that means something is wrong here.
wait, but this suggests that my assumption or calculation is incorrect.
wait, but how did we get here.
so if we have:
from equation 1: a = 122 - b - c
if b + c = 234, then a = 122 - 234 = -112.
which is impossible.
therefore, there is a contradiction here, which suggests that either our initial assumption is wrong or perhaps miscalculations were made.
wait, but earlier we found x = 73, and using that we derived d = 0, leading to this contradiction.
wait, but how did we get d = 0?
let me check the steps again.
after finding x = 73, we had equations:
from |s|: f + c + d = 489
from the fact that b + c + d = 234 (since exactly two items: b + c + d = 234)
then in the inclusion-exclusion, we found that sum of pairwise intersections |d ∩ g| + |d ∩ s| + |g ∩ s| = 453, which with x=73 gives (b + x) + (c +x ) + (d +x ) = (b + c + d) + 3x = 234 + 3*73 = 234 + 219 = 453.
correct.
but when we tried to solve for individual variables, assuming that:
|d| = a + b + c + x = 195
which gives a + b + c = 195 - 73 = 122
similarly for |g|: e + b + d = 294
and |s|: f + c + d = 489
and we know that a + e + f = 437
but when we tried to solve, we had:
equation1: a = 122 - b - c
equations1: a + e + f = 437
substitute a: 122 - b - c + e + f = 437 ⇒ e + f = 437 - 122 + b + c = 315 + b + c
but from e = 294 - b - d (from |g| equation: e + b + d = 294 ⇒ e = 294 - b - d)
and f = 489 - c - d (from |s| equation: f + c + d = 489 ⇒ f = 489 - c - d)
therefore:
e + f = (294 - b - d) + (489 - c - d) = 783 - b - c - 2d
but we also have e + f = 315 + b + c
therefore:
783 - b - c - 2d = 315 + b + c
simplify:
783 - 315 = b + c + 2d + b + c
468 = 2b + 2c + 2d
divide by 2:
234 = b + c + d
but we already know that b + c + d = 234 (exactly two items).
so 234 = 234.
this is an identity, so it gives no new information.
therefore, my previous step where i solved for d was incorrect.
so in reality, when i thought i found d = 0, that was due to a mistake.
actually, the equation 468 = 2*(b + c + d) => 234 = b + c + d, which we already knew.
therefore, my conclusion that d = 0 was wrong.
therefore, we can't determine d from these equations.
therefore, my mistake was thinking that d = 0.
therefore, maybe the value of x=73 is correct, but my subsequent checks were flawed.
therefore, perhaps x=73 is correct, and the problem is solvable with that answer.
let me cross-verify.
total people in d, g, s unions:
as per earlier, |d ∪ g ∪ s| = 671 + x = 671 + 73 = 744
then, n = 900 - 744 = 156, which is consistent.
then verify inclusion-exclusion:
|d| + |g| + |s| = 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124
sum of pairwise intersections: |d ∩ g| + |d ∩ s| + |g ∩ s| = 453
then |d ∪ g ∪ s| = 1124 - 453 + x = 1124 - 453 + 73 = 1124 - 453 is 671, 671 +73=744, which matches.
therefore, all the numbers check out.
therefore, the answer x=73 is correct.
therefore, despite not being able to solve for all individual variables, the principle of inclusion-exclusion holds with x=73, and the answer is correct.
**final answer**
\boxed{73}
