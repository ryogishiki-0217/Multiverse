So, if D, E, C, F are collinear, then E must lie somewhere on DC, right? Because DC is the side of rectangle ABCD from D to C. But wait, ABCD is a rectangle with AB=107 (length) and BC=16 (width). So DC is the top side of length 107, from D to C. Then EFGH is another rectangle, with EF=184 and FG=17. Wait, EF=184? That's longer than AB which is 107. Hmm, but EFGH is another rectangle. So perhaps E is on DC, then F is beyond C, making EF=184. But DC is only length 107. Hmm, this is confusing. Wait, maybe the rectangle EFGH is standing vertically? Because if EF=184 is the length, it can't fit along DC which is only 107. So perhaps EFGH is placed such that E is near D, but then F is not on DC, but maybe DC and EF are partially overlapping, but collinear? Wait, the problem states that D, E, C, F are collinear. So these four points lie on a straight line. Let me parse that again: D, E, C, F are collinear. So starting from point D, then E, then C, then F, all on a line. Wait, but in rectangle ABCD, point C is opposite from D. So in rectangle ABCD, D is one corner, A is adjacent, B is opposite, and C is adjacent to B. So DC is one of the sides of length 16? Wait no, ABCD is a rectangle with AB=107 and BC=16. So AB and CD are the lengths (107), and AD and BC are the widths (16). So DC is the top side with length 107. So point D is (0,16), C is (107,16) if we consider coordinate system with A at (0,0). Then EFGH is another rectangle, with E and F on the line DC, but extending beyond? Wait, but EFGH's sides are EF=184 and FG=17. So EF=184 is much longer than DC=107. So perhaps EFGH is placed such that E is somewhere before C (on the line DC) and F is beyond C. Wait, but D, E, C, F are collinear. So order is D, E, C, F. So E is between D and C, and then F is after C. But then F would be off the rectangle ABCD. Then rectangle EFGH has EF=184 (length) and FG=17 (width). So EFGH would be a rectangle with length 184 and width 17. But since E is between D and C, and F is after C, then G and H would be offset. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to visualize it again. Let's place rectangle ABCD on the coordinate system: Let A be (0, 0), B be (107, 0), C be (107, 16), and D be (0, 16). Wait, wait, no. Wait, in a rectangle, the coordinates depend on how it's oriented. If AB is the base with length 107, then AD would be the side with height 16. So let's say point A is (0, 0), B is (107, 0), D is (0, 16), and C is (107, 16). So DC is the top side from (0, 16) to (107, 16). Then EFGH is another rectangle such that points D, E, C, F are collinear. So these points lie on a straight line. So the line passes through D (0,16) and C (107,16). That's the top side of rectangle ABCD. So line DC is horizontal, from (0,16) to (107,16). Then E and F are also on this line. Since the order is D, E, C, F, collinear, E must be between D and C, and F is beyond C. So E is somewhere between D and C on the line DC, and F is extended beyond C on the same line. Then rectangle EFGH has EF=184 and FG=17. So EF is the length 184, which is from E to F. Since E is before C and F is after C, then EFGH must be a rectangle that's laid out along the line DC, starting at E (before C) and extending to F (beyond C), with FG perpendicular to EF (since it's a rectangle). But FG is given as 17. So since EF is horizontal (since DC is horizontal), then FG would be vertical, up or down. Wait, but EFGH is a rectangle. So if EF is the base, then FG is the side. If EF is horizontal, then FG is vertical. Since in rectangle EFGH, EF=184 and FG=17, then EFGH is a rectangle with length 184 and height 17. So if E is to the left of C on line DC, then F is to the right of C, and then GH would be above or below EF? Wait, since point H is connected to E and G is connected to F. Wait, the problem says A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. So points A, D, H, G are concyclic. So maybe this cyclic condition will help determine the exact position. So first, let's formalize the coordinates. Let me assign coordinates based on the above setup. Let’s set coordinate system: - Let A be (0, 0). - Then D is (0, 16) since AD = BC = 16. - B is (107, 0), and C is (107, 16). - The line DC is from (0,16) to (107,16), which is the horizontal line y=16 from x=0 to x=107. - Now, E and F are collinear with D and C, so they lie on the line y=16. Let’s denote E as (e, 16) where e is between 0 and 107 (since E is between D and C). Then F is beyond C, so F would be (f, 16) where f > 107. The distance between E and F is EF = 184. So the distance between (e, 16) and (f, 16) is |f - e| = 184. Since f > e, f - e = 184. So f = e + 184. But since E is between D and C, which is from x=0 to x=107, E is at x=e where 0 ≤ e ≤ 107. Then F is at x = e + 184. Since E is on DC, e ≤ 107, but F is at e + 184, which would be 184 + something beyond C. Wait, but C is at x=107. So F would be at x = 107 + (e + 184 - 107)? Wait, maybe not. Wait, if E is between 0 and 107, then F is at e + 184. So if E is at some point before 107, F would be 184 units to the right. For example, if E were at x=0, then F would be at x=184, but E is somewhere between 0 and 107. So F could be anywhere from x=184 (if E were at 0) to x=107 + 184 = 291 (if E were at 107). But since E is on DC, which is from 0 to 107, then F must be beyond C, which is at 107. So F is somewhere to the right of 107, up to 107 + 184 = 291. But we need to connect F to G with FG=17. Since EFGH is a rectangle, FG is perpendicular to EF. Since EF is horizontal (since E and F are on y=16), FG must be vertical. So from F (f, 16), G is either up or down. Since it's a rectangle, FG=17. Let's assume G is above F, then G would be (f, 16+17) = (f, 33). Similarly, H would be at (e, 33), forming the rectangle EFGH with E(e,16), F(f,16), G(f,33), H(e,33). But wait, no. Wait, EFGH is a rectangle. If EF is the base from E(e,16) to F(f,16), then FG is vertical upwards to G(f, 33), and then HG is the side from G(f,33) to H(e,33), and HE from H(e,33) back to E(e,16). So rectangle EFGH has vertices E(e,16), F(f,16), G(f,33), H(e,33). Now, the problem says that A, D, H, G are concyclic. So points A(0,0), D(0,16), G(f,33), and H(e,33) lie on a circle. So we can use the condition of cyclic quadrilateral to find the relationship between e and f, and then use the distance EF=184 and FG=17 to find the actual values. Given that EF=184, since E is (e,16) and F is (f,16), then f - e = 184. So f = e + 184. But since E is on DC, which is from x=0 to x=107. So e ≤ 107, but then f = e + 184 would be at minimum 184 (if e=0) up to 107 + 184 = 291. However, rectangle EFGH extends beyond point C. But the position of G is at (f,33) and H at (e,33). So now, we need to find e such that points A(0,0), D(0,16), G(f,33), and H(e,33) are concyclic. So these four points lie on a circle. The coordinates are: - A(0,0) - D(0,16) - G(f,33) - H(e,33) And we know that f = e + 184. So we can substitute f with e + 184. Let's write the equation for the circle passing through these four points. Since it's a circle, the general equation of a circle is x2 + y2 + ax + by + c = 0. But since points A, D, G, H lie on the circle, we can substitute their coordinates into the equation. Let me set up the equations. First, substitute point A(0,0): 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + c = 0 ⇒ c = 0. So c=0. Second, substitute point D(0,16): 0 + 256 + 0 + 16b + 0 = 256 + 16b = 0 ⇒ 16b = -256 ⇒ b = -16. So b = -16. Now, substitute point H(e,33): e2 + 1089 + ae + (-16)*33 + 0 = e2 + 1089 + ae - 528 = e2 + ae + 561 = 0. Similarly, substitute point G(f,33): f2 + 1089 + af + (-16)*33 + 0 = f2 + 1089 + af - 528 = f2 + af + 561 = 0. So both points H and G give us equations: For H: e2 + ae + 561 = 0. For G: f2 + af + 561 = 0. But we know that f = e + 184. So we have two equations: 1. e2 + ae + 561 = 0. 2. (e + 184)^2 + a(e + 184) + 561 = 0. Let me expand the second equation: (e2 + 368e + 33856) + a(e + 184) + 561 = 0. Which simplifies to: e2 + (368 + a)e + 33856 + 184a + 561 = 0. Combine like terms: e2 + (a + 368)e + (33856 + 184a + 561) = e2 + (a + 368)e + (34417 + 184a) = 0. But from the first equation, we have e2 + a e + 561 = 0. So subtract the first equation from the expanded second equation: [e2 + (a + 368)e + (34417 + 184a) + 0] - [e2 + a e + 561] = 0. Simplifying: (a + 368)e - a e + 34417 + 184a - 561 = 368e + 33856 + 184a = 0. So 368e + 33856 + 184a = 0. Divide the entire equation by 184: 2e + 184 + a = 0. Therefore, a = -2e - 184. Now, substitute this value of a back into the first equation: e2 + a e + 561 = 0. So e2 + (-2e - 184)e + 561 = 0. Expand: e2 - 2e2 - 184e + 561 = 0. Combine terms: -e2 - 184e + 561 = 0. Multiply both sides by -1: e2 + 184e - 561 = 0. Now, we can solve this quadratic equation for e: e = [-184 ± sqrt(1842 + 4*561)] / 2. Compute discriminant: 1842 = (180 + 4)2 = 1802 + 2*180*4 + 42 = 32400 + 1440 + 16 = 33856. Then 4*561 = 2244. Thus, discriminant = 33856 + 2244 = 36100. sqrt(36100) = 190. Therefore, e = [-184 ± 190]/2. Compute the two solutions: First solution: e = (-184 + 190)/2 = 6/2 = 3. Second solution: e = (-184 - 190)/2 = (-374)/2 = -187. But e represents the x-coordinate of point E, which is between D(0,16) and C(107,16). So e must be between 0 and 107. Therefore, e = 3. So E is at (3,16). Then f = e + 184 = 3 + 184 = 187. So F is at (187,16). Then G is at (187,33) and H is at (3,33). Now, we need to verify that these points lie on the circle with the equation we found. We already used the equations to find e, so let's check point G(187,33) and H(3,33). First, the circle equation: x2 + y2 + a x + b y + c = 0. We found c = 0, b = -16, and a = -2e - 184 = -2*3 - 184 = -6 - 184 = -190. So the circle equation is: x2 + y2 - 190x - 16y = 0. Let's check point H(3,33): 32 + 332 - 190*3 -16*33 = 9 + 1089 - 570 - 528 = (9 + 1089) - (570 + 528) = 1098 - 1098 = 0. Checks out. Check point G(187,33): 1872 + 332 - 190*187 - 16*33. Compute 1872: 187*187. Let's compute: 187*187 = (180 + 7)^2 = 1802 + 2*180*7 + 72 = 32400 + 2520 + 49 = 34969. 332 = 1089. So 34969 + 1089 = 36058. Now, 190*187: 190*187 = 190*(180 + 7) = 190*180 + 190*7 = 34200 + 1330 = 35530. 16*33 = 528. Total subtraction: 35530 + 528 = 36058. So 36058 - 36058 = 0. Checks out. So the points are concyclic. Now, we need to find the length CE. Point C is (107,16), point E is (3,16). The distance CE is the distance between (107,16) and (3,16). Since they have the same y-coordinate, it's just the difference in x-coordinates: 107 - 3 = 104. So CE = 104. Wait, but wait. If E is at (3,16), then CE is 107 - 3 = 104. But let me confirm once again. From the diagram, if D is at (0,16), E at (3,16), C at (107,16), then E is 3 units away from D, right? Then DC is 107 units long, so EC is 107 - 3 = 104. So CE = 104. But before finalizing, let's check the other dimensions. The problem says FG=17, which in our coordinates is from (187,16) to (187,33), which is indeed 17 units. And EF=184, from (3,16) to (187,16) is 184 units. That checks out. The other rectangle dimensions: EFGH. EH should be equal to FG=17. Wait, EH is from (3,16) to (3,33). Indeed, that's 17 units. And FG is from (187,16) to (187,33), also 17. Good. The length EF=184, which is 184. So all dimensions are satisfied. The cyclic condition is satisfied. Thus, CE = 104. The answer is 104. Wait, but let me check once again if I didn't mess up coordinate assignments. Wait, in the problem statement, it's BC=16 and AB=107. So AB is the base, BC is the vertical side. So coordinates are correct: A(0,0), B(107,0), C(107,16), D(0,16). Then E is on DC, so between D and C at (3,16). Then the circle passes through A, D, H, G. We found H at (3,33) and G at (187,33). Let me check if these points lie on the circle. We already verified using the equation. Let me check point A(0,0): 0 + 0 - 190*0 - 16*0 = 0, yes. Point D(0,16): 0 + 256 - 190*0 -16*16 = 256 - 256 = 0, checks out. Point G(187,33): 1872 + 332 - 190*187 -16*33. Let's compute 1872: 187*187. As before, 187*187 = 34969. 332=1089. So 34969 + 1089 = 36058. Then 190*187: 190*187. Let's compute 190*(200 - 13) = 190*200 - 190*13 = 38000 - 2470 = 35530. 16*33=528. So total subtraction: 35530 + 528 = 36058. Thus, 36058 - 36058 = 0. Correct. Similarly, point H(3,33): 32 + 332 -190*3 -16*33 = 9 + 1089 - 570 - 528 = 1098 - 1098 = 0. Correct. So all points lie on the circle. Therefore, the solution is consistent. Hence, the length CE is 107 - 3 = 104. So the answer is 104. But to confirm once again, in case there's another possible mistake. The problem states that in rectangle ABCD, AB=107 and BC=16, so the width is 16 and length is 107. So the coordinates are correctly placed. EFGH is a rectangle with EF=184 and FG=17. Since EF=184 is longer than AB=107, EFGH must extend beyond the bounds of ABCD. Since D,E,C,F are collinear, they lie on DC, which is part of the top side of ABCD. But to have EF=184, E must be before C (to the left) so that F is beyond C. The exact position is determined by the cyclic condition, which led us to e=3. Thus, CE is 107 - 3 = 104. That seems correct. So the answer should be 104. I think that's it. The answer is 104.
**Final Answer** 
\boxed{104}
</Think>

Answer: Given rectangles \(ABCD\) and \(EFGH\) with the conditions that \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear and \(A, D, H, G\) are concyclic. The dimensions provided are \(BC = 16\), \(AB = 107\), \(FG = 17\), and \(EF = 184\). We need to find the length of \(CE\).

1. **Coordinates Setup**:
   - Rectangle \(ABCD\) with \(A(0, 0)\), \(B(107, 0)\), \(C(107, 16)\), and \(D(0, 16)\).
   - Points \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear on the line \(y = 16\). Let \(E\) be \((e, 16)\) and \(F\) be \((f, 16)\). Since \(EF = 184\), we have \(f = e + 184\).

2. **Cyclic Quadrilateral Condition**:
   - Points \(A(0, 0)\), \(D(0, 16)\), \(G(f, 33)\), and \(H(e, 33)\) lie on a circle.
   - Using the general equation of a circle \(x^2 + y^2 + ax + by + c = 0\), substituting the coordinates of \(A\) and \(D\) gives \(c = 0\) and \(b = -16\).
   - Substituting \(H(e, 33)\) and \(G(f, 33)\) into the circle equation leads to solving for \(e\) and \(f\).

3. **Solving for \(e\)**:
   - Quadratic equation derived from the circle conditions: \(e^2 + 184e - 561 = 0\).
   - Solving this quadratic equation, we find \(e = 3\) (since \(e\) must be between 0 and 107).

4. **Calculating \(CE\)**:
   - Coordinates of \(E\) are \((3, 16)\) and \(C\) are \((107, 16)\).
   - The distance \(CE\) is \(107 - 3 = 104\).

Thus, the length of \(CE\) is \(\boxed{104}\).

so, if d, e, c, f are collinear, then e must lie somewhere on dc, right? because dc is the side of rectangle abcd from d to c. but wait, abcd is a rectangle with ab=107 (length) and bc=16 (width). so dc is the top side of length 107, from d to c. then efgh is another rectangle, with ef=184 and fg=17. wait, ef=184? that's longer than ab which is 107. hmm, but efgh is another rectangle. so perhaps e is on dc, then f is beyond c, making ef=184. but dc is only length 107. hmm, this is confusing. wait, maybe the rectangle efgh is standing vertically? because if ef=184 is the length, it can't fit along dc which is only 107. so perhaps efgh is placed such that e is near d, but then f is not on dc, but maybe dc and ef are partially overlapping, but collinear? wait, the problem states that d, e, c, f are collinear. so these four points lie on a straight line. let me parse that again: d, e, c, f are collinear. so starting from point d, then e, then c, then f, all on a line. wait, but in rectangle abcd, point c is opposite from d. so in rectangle abcd, d is one corner, a is adjacent, b is opposite, and c is adjacent to b. so dc is one of the sides of length 16? wait no, abcd is a rectangle with ab=107 and bc=16. so ab and cd are the lengths (107), and ad and bc are the widths (16). so dc is the top side with length 107. so point d is (0,16), c is (107,16) if we consider coordinate system with a at (0,0). then efgh is another rectangle, with e and f on the line dc, but extending beyond? wait, but efgh's sides are ef=184 and fg=17. so ef=184 is much longer than dc=107. so perhaps efgh is placed such that e is somewhere before c (on the line dc) and f is beyond c. wait, but d, e, c, f are collinear. so order is d, e, c, f. so e is between d and c, and then f is after c. but then f would be off the rectangle abcd. then rectangle efgh has ef=184 (length) and fg=17 (width). so efgh would be a rectangle with length 184 and width 17. but since e is between d and c, and f is after c, then g and h would be offset. hmm, this is getting complicated. let me try to visualize it again. let's place rectangle abcd on the coordinate system: let a be (0, 0), b be (107, 0), c be (107, 16), and d be (0, 16). wait, wait, no. wait, in a rectangle, the coordinates depend on how it's oriented. if ab is the base with length 107, then ad would be the side with height 16. so let's say point a is (0, 0), b is (107, 0), d is (0, 16), and c is (107, 16). so dc is the top side from (0, 16) to (107, 16). then efgh is another rectangle such that points d, e, c, f are collinear. so these points lie on a straight line. so the line passes through d (0,16) and c (107,16). that's the top side of rectangle abcd. so line dc is horizontal, from (0,16) to (107,16). then e and f are also on this line. since the order is d, e, c, f, collinear, e must be between d and c, and f is beyond c. so e is somewhere between d and c on the line dc, and f is extended beyond c on the same line. then rectangle efgh has ef=184 and fg=17. so ef is the length 184, which is from e to f. since e is before c and f is after c, then efgh must be a rectangle that's laid out along the line dc, starting at e (before c) and extending to f (beyond c), with fg perpendicular to ef (since it's a rectangle). but fg is given as 17. so since ef is horizontal (since dc is horizontal), then fg would be vertical, up or down. wait, but efgh is a rectangle. so if ef is the base, then fg is the side. if ef is horizontal, then fg is vertical. since in rectangle efgh, ef=184 and fg=17, then efgh is a rectangle with length 184 and height 17. so if e is to the left of c on line dc, then f is to the right of c, and then gh would be above or below ef? wait, since point h is connected to e and g is connected to f. wait, the problem says a, d, h, g all lie on a circle. so points a, d, h, g are concyclic. so maybe this cyclic condition will help determine the exact position. so first, let's formalize the coordinates. let me assign coordinates based on the above setup. let’s set coordinate system: - let a be (0, 0). - then d is (0, 16) since ad = bc = 16. - b is (107, 0), and c is (107, 16). - the line dc is from (0,16) to (107,16), which is the horizontal line y=16 from x=0 to x=107. - now, e and f are collinear with d and c, so they lie on the line y=16. let’s denote e as (e, 16) where e is between 0 and 107 (since e is between d and c). then f is beyond c, so f would be (f, 16) where f > 107. the distance between e and f is ef = 184. so the distance between (e, 16) and (f, 16) is |f - e| = 184. since f > e, f - e = 184. so f = e + 184. but since e is between d and c, which is from x=0 to x=107, e is at x=e where 0 ≤ e ≤ 107. then f is at x = e + 184. since e is on dc, e ≤ 107, but f is at e + 184, which would be 184 + something beyond c. wait, but c is at x=107. so f would be at x = 107 + (e + 184 - 107)? wait, maybe not. wait, if e is between 0 and 107, then f is at e + 184. so if e is at some point before 107, f would be 184 units to the right. for example, if e were at x=0, then f would be at x=184, but e is somewhere between 0 and 107. so f could be anywhere from x=184 (if e were at 0) to x=107 + 184 = 291 (if e were at 107). but since e is on dc, which is from 0 to 107, then f must be beyond c, which is at 107. so f is somewhere to the right of 107, up to 107 + 184 = 291. but we need to connect f to g with fg=17. since efgh is a rectangle, fg is perpendicular to ef. since ef is horizontal (since e and f are on y=16), fg must be vertical. so from f (f, 16), g is either up or down. since it's a rectangle, fg=17. let's assume g is above f, then g would be (f, 16+17) = (f, 33). similarly, h would be at (e, 33), forming the rectangle efgh with e(e,16), f(f,16), g(f,33), h(e,33). but wait, no. wait, efgh is a rectangle. if ef is the base from e(e,16) to f(f,16), then fg is vertical upwards to g(f, 33), and then hg is the side from g(f,33) to h(e,33), and he from h(e,33) back to e(e,16). so rectangle efgh has vertices e(e,16), f(f,16), g(f,33), h(e,33). now, the problem says that a, d, h, g are concyclic. so points a(0,0), d(0,16), g(f,33), and h(e,33) lie on a circle. so we can use the condition of cyclic quadrilateral to find the relationship between e and f, and then use the distance ef=184 and fg=17 to find the actual values. given that ef=184, since e is (e,16) and f is (f,16), then f - e = 184. so f = e + 184. but since e is on dc, which is from x=0 to x=107. so e ≤ 107, but then f = e + 184 would be at minimum 184 (if e=0) up to 107 + 184 = 291. however, rectangle efgh extends beyond point c. but the position of g is at (f,33) and h at (e,33). so now, we need to find e such that points a(0,0), d(0,16), g(f,33), and h(e,33) are concyclic. so these four points lie on a circle. the coordinates are: - a(0,0) - d(0,16) - g(f,33) - h(e,33) and we know that f = e + 184. so we can substitute f with e + 184. let's write the equation for the circle passing through these four points. since it's a circle, the general equation of a circle is x2 + y2 + ax + by + c = 0. but since points a, d, g, h lie on the circle, we can substitute their coordinates into the equation. let me set up the equations. first, substitute point a(0,0): 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + c = 0 ⇒ c = 0. so c=0. second, substitute point d(0,16): 0 + 256 + 0 + 16b + 0 = 256 + 16b = 0 ⇒ 16b = -256 ⇒ b = -16. so b = -16. now, substitute point h(e,33): e2 + 1089 + ae + (-16)*33 + 0 = e2 + 1089 + ae - 528 = e2 + ae + 561 = 0. similarly, substitute point g(f,33): f2 + 1089 + af + (-16)*33 + 0 = f2 + 1089 + af - 528 = f2 + af + 561 = 0. so both points h and g give us equations: for h: e2 + ae + 561 = 0. for g: f2 + af + 561 = 0. but we know that f = e + 184. so we have two equations: 1. e2 + ae + 561 = 0. 2. (e + 184)^2 + a(e + 184) + 561 = 0. let me expand the second equation: (e2 + 368e + 33856) + a(e + 184) + 561 = 0. which simplifies to: e2 + (368 + a)e + 33856 + 184a + 561 = 0. combine like terms: e2 + (a + 368)e + (33856 + 184a + 561) = e2 + (a + 368)e + (34417 + 184a) = 0. but from the first equation, we have e2 + a e + 561 = 0. so subtract the first equation from the expanded second equation: [e2 + (a + 368)e + (34417 + 184a) + 0] - [e2 + a e + 561] = 0. simplifying: (a + 368)e - a e + 34417 + 184a - 561 = 368e + 33856 + 184a = 0. so 368e + 33856 + 184a = 0. divide the entire equation by 184: 2e + 184 + a = 0. therefore, a = -2e - 184. now, substitute this value of a back into the first equation: e2 + a e + 561 = 0. so e2 + (-2e - 184)e + 561 = 0. expand: e2 - 2e2 - 184e + 561 = 0. combine terms: -e2 - 184e + 561 = 0. multiply both sides by -1: e2 + 184e - 561 = 0. now, we can solve this quadratic equation for e: e = [-184 ± sqrt(1842 + 4*561)] / 2. compute discriminant: 1842 = (180 + 4)2 = 1802 + 2*180*4 + 42 = 32400 + 1440 + 16 = 33856. then 4*561 = 2244. thus, discriminant = 33856 + 2244 = 36100. sqrt(36100) = 190. therefore, e = [-184 ± 190]/2. compute the two solutions: first solution: e = (-184 + 190)/2 = 6/2 = 3. second solution: e = (-184 - 190)/2 = (-374)/2 = -187. but e represents the x-coordinate of point e, which is between d(0,16) and c(107,16). so e must be between 0 and 107. therefore, e = 3. so e is at (3,16). then f = e + 184 = 3 + 184 = 187. so f is at (187,16). then g is at (187,33) and h is at (3,33). now, we need to verify that these points lie on the circle with the equation we found. we already used the equations to find e, so let's check point g(187,33) and h(3,33). first, the circle equation: x2 + y2 + a x + b y + c = 0. we found c = 0, b = -16, and a = -2e - 184 = -2*3 - 184 = -6 - 184 = -190. so the circle equation is: x2 + y2 - 190x - 16y = 0. let's check point h(3,33): 32 + 332 - 190*3 -16*33 = 9 + 1089 - 570 - 528 = (9 + 1089) - (570 + 528) = 1098 - 1098 = 0. checks out. check point g(187,33): 1872 + 332 - 190*187 - 16*33. compute 1872: 187*187. let's compute: 187*187 = (180 + 7)^2 = 1802 + 2*180*7 + 72 = 32400 + 2520 + 49 = 34969. 332 = 1089. so 34969 + 1089 = 36058. now, 190*187: 190*187 = 190*(180 + 7) = 190*180 + 190*7 = 34200 + 1330 = 35530. 16*33 = 528. total subtraction: 35530 + 528 = 36058. so 36058 - 36058 = 0. checks out. so the points are concyclic. now, we need to find the length ce. point c is (107,16), point e is (3,16). the distance ce is the distance between (107,16) and (3,16). since they have the same y-coordinate, it's just the difference in x-coordinates: 107 - 3 = 104. so ce = 104. wait, but wait. if e is at (3,16), then ce is 107 - 3 = 104. but let me confirm once again. from the diagram, if d is at (0,16), e at (3,16), c at (107,16), then e is 3 units away from d, right? then dc is 107 units long, so ec is 107 - 3 = 104. so ce = 104. but before finalizing, let's check the other dimensions. the problem says fg=17, which in our coordinates is from (187,16) to (187,33), which is indeed 17 units. and ef=184, from (3,16) to (187,16) is 184 units. that checks out. the other rectangle dimensions: efgh. eh should be equal to fg=17. wait, eh is from (3,16) to (3,33). indeed, that's 17 units. and fg is from (187,16) to (187,33), also 17. good. the length ef=184, which is 184. so all dimensions are satisfied. the cyclic condition is satisfied. thus, ce = 104. the answer is 104. wait, but let me check once again if i didn't mess up coordinate assignments. wait, in the problem statement, it's bc=16 and ab=107. so ab is the base, bc is the vertical side. so coordinates are correct: a(0,0), b(107,0), c(107,16), d(0,16). then e is on dc, so between d and c at (3,16). then the circle passes through a, d, h, g. we found h at (3,33) and g at (187,33). let me check if these points lie on the circle. we already verified using the equation. let me check point a(0,0): 0 + 0 - 190*0 - 16*0 = 0, yes. point d(0,16): 0 + 256 - 190*0 -16*16 = 256 - 256 = 0, checks out. point g(187,33): 1872 + 332 - 190*187 -16*33. let's compute 1872: 187*187. as before, 187*187 = 34969. 332=1089. so 34969 + 1089 = 36058. then 190*187: 190*187. let's compute 190*(200 - 13) = 190*200 - 190*13 = 38000 - 2470 = 35530. 16*33=528. so total subtraction: 35530 + 528 = 36058. thus, 36058 - 36058 = 0. correct. similarly, point h(3,33): 32 + 332 -190*3 -16*33 = 9 + 1089 - 570 - 528 = 1098 - 1098 = 0. correct. so all points lie on the circle. therefore, the solution is consistent. hence, the length ce is 107 - 3 = 104. so the answer is 104. but to confirm once again, in case there's another possible mistake. the problem states that in rectangle abcd, ab=107 and bc=16, so the width is 16 and length is 107. so the coordinates are correctly placed. efgh is a rectangle with ef=184 and fg=17. since ef=184 is longer than ab=107, efgh must extend beyond the bounds of abcd. since d,e,c,f are collinear, they lie on dc, which is part of the top side of abcd. but to have ef=184, e must be before c (to the left) so that f is beyond c. the exact position is determined by the cyclic condition, which led us to e=3. thus, ce is 107 - 3 = 104. that seems correct. so the answer should be 104. i think that's it. the answer is 104.
**final answer** 
\boxed{104}
</think>

answer: given rectangles \(abcd\) and \(efgh\) with the conditions that \(d, e, c, f\) are collinear and \(a, d, h, g\) are concyclic. the dimensions provided are \(bc = 16\), \(ab = 107\), \(fg = 17\), and \(ef = 184\). we need to find the length of \(ce\).

1. **coordinates setup**:
   - rectangle \(abcd\) with \(a(0, 0)\), \(b(107, 0)\), \(c(107, 16)\), and \(d(0, 16)\).
   - points \(d, e, c, f\) are collinear on the line \(y = 16\). let \(e\) be \((e, 16)\) and \(f\) be \((f, 16)\). since \(ef = 184\), we have \(f = e + 184\).

2. **cyclic quadrilateral condition**:
   - points \(a(0, 0)\), \(d(0, 16)\), \(g(f, 33)\), and \(h(e, 33)\) lie on a circle.
   - using the general equation of a circle \(x^2 + y^2 + ax + by + c = 0\), substituting the coordinates of \(a\) and \(d\) gives \(c = 0\) and \(b = -16\).
   - substituting \(h(e, 33)\) and \(g(f, 33)\) into the circle equation leads to solving for \(e\) and \(f\).

3. **solving for \(e\)**:
   - quadratic equation derived from the circle conditions: \(e^2 + 184e - 561 = 0\).
   - solving this quadratic equation, we find \(e = 3\) (since \(e\) must be between 0 and 107).

4. **calculating \(ce\)**:
   - coordinates of \(e\) are \((3, 16)\) and \(c\) are \((107, 16)\).
   - the distance \(ce\) is \(107 - 3 = 104\).

thus, the length of \(ce\) is \(\boxed{104}\)
