Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step.
First, I know that when dealing with complex numbers on a circle with radius 4 (since |z| = 4), it might be helpful to represent z in polar form. So, z can be written as 4e^(iθ), where θ is the argument of z. But maybe it's easier to work with rectangular coordinates too. Wait, let me think.
The expression has two terms: one is (75 + 117i)z and the other is (96 + 144i)/z. Since |z| = 4, then 1/z is equal to z̄/|z|2, which is z̄/16, because |z|2 = 16. So, maybe I can rewrite the second term as (96 + 144i)z̄/16, which simplifies to (6 + 9i)z̄. So the expression becomes (75 + 117i)z + (6 + 9i)z̄.
But z̄ is the conjugate of z. If I write z as x + yi, where x and y are real numbers, then z̄ is x - yi. Wait, but |z| = 4, so x2 + y2 = 16.
Alternatively, since z is on the circle with radius 4, we can parameterize z as 4(cosθ + i sinθ). Let me try that.
Let me set z = 4e^(iθ) = 4(cosθ + i sinθ). Then, z̄ = 4(cosθ - i sinθ).
So, then the expression becomes:
(75 + 117i) * 4e^(iθ) + (96 + 144i)/ (4e^(iθ))
Simplify that:
First term: (75 + 117i) * 4e^(iθ) = 4*(75 + 117i)*e^(iθ)
Second term: (96 + 144i)/(4e^(iθ)) = (24 + 36i)/e^(iθ)
So, combining these:
4*(75 + 117i)*e^(iθ) + (24 + 36i)/e^(iθ)
Hmm, that's a bit messy. Maybe I can represent e^(iθ) as cosθ + i sinθ.
Let me try that.
First term: 4*(75 + 117i)*(cosθ + i sinθ)
Second term: (24 + 36i)/(cosθ + i sinθ). But dividing by cosθ + i sinθ is the same as multiplying by its conjugate over |z|2, but since denominator here is e^(iθ) which has length 1, so multiplying by conjugate gives 1. Wait:
Actually, 1/(cosθ + i sinθ) = cosθ - i sinθ, because (cosθ + i sinθ)(cosθ - i sinθ) = cos2θ + sin2θ = 1.
Therefore, the second term (24 + 36i)/e^(iθ) is (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ).
So, overall expression becomes:
First term: 4*(75 + 117i)*(cosθ + i sinθ)
Second term: (24 + 36i)*(cosθ - i sinθ)
Therefore, combining:
4*(75 + 117i)(cosθ + i sinθ) + (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ)
Let me compute each term separately.
First term:
4*(75cosθ + 75i sinθ + 117i cosθ - 117 sinθ)
Because multiplying (75 + 117i) by (cosθ + i sinθ):
75*cosθ + 75i sinθ + 117i cosθ - 117 sinθ
Then factor the real and imaginary parts:
Real parts: 75cosθ - 117 sinθ
Imaginary parts: 75 sinθ + 117 cosθ
Then multiplying by 4:
4*[75cosθ - 117 sinθ + i(75 sinθ + 117 cosθ)]
So, 4*(75cosθ - 117 sinθ) + i*4*(75 sinθ + 117 cosθ)
Second term:
(24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ) = 24cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ + 36 sinθ
Again, combining real and imaginary parts:
Real parts: 24cosθ + 36 sinθ
Imaginary parts: -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ
So, putting both terms together:
First term's real part: 4*(75cosθ - 117 sinθ)
Second term's real part: 24cosθ + 36 sinθ
First term's imaginary part: 4*(75 sinθ + 117 cosθ)
Second term's imaginary part: -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ
Therefore, total real part:
4*(75cosθ - 117 sinθ) + 24cosθ + 36 sinθ
Similarly, total imaginary part:
4*(75 sinθ + 117 cosθ) -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ
But the problem asks for the largest possible real part of the entire expression. So, we can ignore the imaginary part, and focus on maximizing the real part.
So, the real part is:
4*(75cosθ - 117 sinθ) + 24cosθ + 36 sinθ
Let me compute that:
First, compute 4*(75cosθ) = 300cosθ
4*(-117 sinθ) = -468 sinθ
Then add 24cosθ + 36 sinθ:
So, total Real part:
(300cosθ + 24cosθ) + (-468 sinθ + 36 sinθ)
= 324cosθ - 432 sinθ
So, the real part simplifies to 324cosθ - 432 sinθ
So, our goal is to maximize the expression 324cosθ - 432 sinθ
How do we maximize that?
Let's recall that for an expression of the form A cosθ + B sinθ, the maximum value is sqrt(A2 + B2).
Wait, but here it's 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, so it's A cosθ + B sinθ where A = 324 and B = -432.
Therefore, the maximum is sqrt(3242 + (-432)2).
Let me compute that.
First, compute 324 squared:
324 * 324. Let's see:
300^2 = 90,000
24^2 = 576
2*300*24 = 14,400
So, (300 + 24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 + 24^2 = 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 104,976
Therefore, 3242 = 104,976
Now, 432 squared:
400^2 = 160,000
32^2 = 1,024
2*400*32 = 25,600
But wait, 432 = 400 + 32
So, (400 + 32)^2 = 400^2 + 2*400*32 + 32^2 = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 186,624
Therefore, (-432)^2 = 186,624
Therefore, sqrt(3242 + (-432)^2) = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600)
What's sqrt(291,600)?
Let me compute this.
291,600. Let's factor this:
291,600 divided by 100 is 2,916.
So sqrt(291,600) = sqrt(2,916 * 100) = sqrt(2,916)*sqrt(100) = 54*10 = 540
Wait, because 54^2 = 2,916. Yes, 50^2 = 2,500 and 54^2 = (50 +4)^2 = 2500 + 400 + 16 = 2,916.
Therefore, sqrt(291,600) = 540.
Therefore, the maximum real part is 540. Hmm, so is that the answer? Wait, but hold on.
Wait, the expression is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, which can be written as R cos(theta + phi), where R is sqrt(3242 + 4322). Wait, but since it's -432 sin(theta), the amplitude is sqrt(A2 + B2), regardless of the sign. Yes, sqrt(3242 + (-432)^2) = sqrt(3242 + 4322) = 540.
Therefore, the expression can be written as 540 cos(theta + phi), for some angle phi. Therefore, the maximum value is 540, as the maximum of cosine is 1.
Therefore, the maximum real part is 540.
Wait, but before I jump to conclusions, let me confirm. Let's check units and calculations.
Original coefficients: (75, 117i) and (96, 144i)/z.
Wait, when I converted (96 + 144i)/z, since |z|=4, we scaled it down by 16 (since dividing by z is multiplying by z̄/16). So (96 +144i)/16 = 6 + 9i. Then, when adding the two terms: (75 +117i)z + (6 +9i)z̄.
Then, if z = x + iy, then expression becomes (75 +117i)(x +iy) + (6 +9i)(x -iy).
Let me compute that:
First term: (75 +117i)(x +iy) = 75x -117y + i(117x +75y)
Second term: (6 +9i)(x - iy) = 6x +9y + i(9x -6y)
Adding them together:
Real parts: 75x -117y + 6x +9y = 81x -108y
Imaginary parts: 117x +75y +9x -6y = 126x +69y
Therefore, real part is 81x - 108y, and imaginary part is 126x +69y.
But since x and y are related by x2 + y2 = 16 (because |z|=4). So x and y are real numbers with x2 + y2 =16.
So, we need to maximize 81x -108y subject to x2 + y2 =16.
So, this is a standard optimization problem where we can use Lagrange multipliers or recognize that the maximum value is the norm of the vector (81, -108) scaled by the radius.
Since x2 + y2 =16, the variables x and y form a circle with radius 4. So, the expression 81x -108y is linear in x and y, and its maximum value is the magnitude of the vector (81, -108) multiplied by the radius 4.
Wait, no, actually, in general, the maximum of a linear function ax + by on the circle x2 + y2 = r2 is r*sqrt(a2 + b2).
So here, plugging in, the maximum would be 4*sqrt(812 + 1082).
Wait, but wait, the original variables x and y satisfy x2 + y2 =16, which is radius 4. So the maximum of 81x -108y is sqrt(812 + (-108)^2) * sqrt(16), wait no, radius is 4, so it's scaled by 4.
Wait, more precisely, for the function f(x,y) = ax + by subject to x2 + y2 = r2, the maximum value is r*sqrt(a2 + b2).
Wait, let's confirm.
For example, take a=1, b=0, radius r, then the maximum is r*1 at x=r, y=0. That's correct. Similarly, in general.
So, the maximum of ax + by on x2 + y2 =r2 is r*sqrt(a2 + b2).
But in our case, it's 81x -108y, so a=81, b= -108, and r=4.
Wait, but x2 + y2 =16, so r=4.
So the maximum is 4*sqrt(812 + (-108)^2).
Compute that:
First, 812 = 6561
1082 = 11,664
So, sum is 6561 + 11,664 = 18,225
sqrt(18,225) = 135, because 135*135 = 18,225.
Let's check: 1302 = 16,900. 1352 = (130 +5)^2 = 1302 + 2*130*5 +52 = 16,900 +1,300 +25 = 18,225.
Yes, so sqrt(18,225) =135.
Therefore, maximum value is 4 *135=540. So same result.
Therefore, regardless of approach—whether through trigonometric substitution or through Lagrange multipliers—the maximum real part is 540.
Therefore, the answer is 540.
Wait, but in my first approach, when I substituted z =4e^(iθ), I got the real part as 324 cosθ -432 sinθ, then found the maximum as 540. Then in the second approach, representing z as x + yi, and maximizing 81x -108y over x2 + y2=16, the maximum is 4*sqrt(812 +1082)=4*135=540. Both approaches concur. So, that's correct.
But, wait, just to be thorough, let's check if these two approaches are consistent.
In the first approach, I rewrote the expression over z=4e^(iθ), simplified the real part to 324 cosθ -432 sinθ, then took the maximum as sqrt(3242 +4322). But in the second approach, the real part was 81x -108y. How do 324 and 432 relate to 81 and -108? Let's see.
Wait, in the first approach, the real part was 324 cosθ -432 sinθ, and in the second, it was 81x -108y. But in the first approach, θ is the argument of z, while in the second approach, z =x + yi with x2 + y2=16.
Wait, but how are θ and x, y related? If z=4e^(iθ), then x=4 cosθ, y=4 sinθ. So substituting into 81x -108y, we get 81*(4 cosθ) -108*(4 sinθ) = 324 cosθ -432 sinθ, which matches the first approach. So they are consistent.
Therefore, both approaches correctly lead to the same expression, so the maximum is indeed 540.
Therefore, the answer is 540. I can conclude that.
**Final Answer**
\boxed{540}

Answer: To find the largest possible real part of the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\) where \(|z| = 4\), we start by parameterizing \(z\) as \(4e^{i\theta}\). 

First, we rewrite the expression in terms of \(z\) and its conjugate:
\[
(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}
\]
Since \(|z| = 4\), we have \(\frac{1}{z} = \frac{\overline{z}}{16}\). Substituting this in, the expression becomes:
\[
(75 + 117i)z + (6 + 9i)\overline{z}
\]

Next, we express \(z\) as \(4(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)\) and \(\overline{z}\) as \(4(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta)\). Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[
4(75 + 117i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta)
\]

Expanding both terms and combining the real parts, we find:
\[
4(75\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta) + 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta
\]

Simplifying the real parts:
\[
4 \cdot 75\cos\theta + 4 \cdot (-117\sin\theta) + 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta
\]
\[
= (300\cos\theta + 24\cos\theta) + (-468\sin\theta + 36\sin\theta)
\]
\[
= 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta
\]

To maximize \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\), we use the fact that the maximum value of \(A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta\) is \(\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}\). Here, \(A = 324\) and \(B = -432\):
\[
\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = \sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \sqrt{291600} = 540
\]

Thus, the largest possible real part is:
\[
\boxed{540}
\]

<think>
okay, so i have this problem here: i need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. hmm, okay. let me break this down step by step.
first, i know that when dealing with complex numbers on a circle with radius 4 (since |z| = 4), it might be helpful to represent z in polar form. so, z can be written as 4e^(iθ), where θ is the argument of z. but maybe it's easier to work with rectangular coordinates too. wait, let me think.
the expression has two terms: one is (75 + 117i)z and the other is (96 + 144i)/z. since |z| = 4, then 1/z is equal to z̄/|z|2, which is z̄/16, because |z|2 = 16. so, maybe i can rewrite the second term as (96 + 144i)z̄/16, which simplifies to (6 + 9i)z̄. so the expression becomes (75 + 117i)z + (6 + 9i)z̄.
but z̄ is the conjugate of z. if i write z as x + yi, where x and y are real numbers, then z̄ is x - yi. wait, but |z| = 4, so x2 + y2 = 16.
alternatively, since z is on the circle with radius 4, we can parameterize z as 4(cosθ + i sinθ). let me try that.
let me set z = 4e^(iθ) = 4(cosθ + i sinθ). then, z̄ = 4(cosθ - i sinθ).
so, then the expression becomes:
(75 + 117i) * 4e^(iθ) + (96 + 144i)/ (4e^(iθ))
simplify that:
first term: (75 + 117i) * 4e^(iθ) = 4*(75 + 117i)*e^(iθ)
second term: (96 + 144i)/(4e^(iθ)) = (24 + 36i)/e^(iθ)
so, combining these:
4*(75 + 117i)*e^(iθ) + (24 + 36i)/e^(iθ)
hmm, that's a bit messy. maybe i can represent e^(iθ) as cosθ + i sinθ.
let me try that.
first term: 4*(75 + 117i)*(cosθ + i sinθ)
second term: (24 + 36i)/(cosθ + i sinθ). but dividing by cosθ + i sinθ is the same as multiplying by its conjugate over |z|2, but since denominator here is e^(iθ) which has length 1, so multiplying by conjugate gives 1. wait:
actually, 1/(cosθ + i sinθ) = cosθ - i sinθ, because (cosθ + i sinθ)(cosθ - i sinθ) = cos2θ + sin2θ = 1.
therefore, the second term (24 + 36i)/e^(iθ) is (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ).
so, overall expression becomes:
first term: 4*(75 + 117i)*(cosθ + i sinθ)
second term: (24 + 36i)*(cosθ - i sinθ)
therefore, combining:
4*(75 + 117i)(cosθ + i sinθ) + (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ)
let me compute each term separately.
first term:
4*(75cosθ + 75i sinθ + 117i cosθ - 117 sinθ)
because multiplying (75 + 117i) by (cosθ + i sinθ):
75*cosθ + 75i sinθ + 117i cosθ - 117 sinθ
then factor the real and imaginary parts:
real parts: 75cosθ - 117 sinθ
imaginary parts: 75 sinθ + 117 cosθ
then multiplying by 4:
4*[75cosθ - 117 sinθ + i(75 sinθ + 117 cosθ)]
so, 4*(75cosθ - 117 sinθ) + i*4*(75 sinθ + 117 cosθ)
second term:
(24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ) = 24cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ + 36 sinθ
again, combining real and imaginary parts:
real parts: 24cosθ + 36 sinθ
imaginary parts: -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ
so, putting both terms together:
first term's real part: 4*(75cosθ - 117 sinθ)
second term's real part: 24cosθ + 36 sinθ
first term's imaginary part: 4*(75 sinθ + 117 cosθ)
second term's imaginary part: -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ
therefore, total real part:
4*(75cosθ - 117 sinθ) + 24cosθ + 36 sinθ
similarly, total imaginary part:
4*(75 sinθ + 117 cosθ) -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ
but the problem asks for the largest possible real part of the entire expression. so, we can ignore the imaginary part, and focus on maximizing the real part.
so, the real part is:
4*(75cosθ - 117 sinθ) + 24cosθ + 36 sinθ
let me compute that:
first, compute 4*(75cosθ) = 300cosθ
4*(-117 sinθ) = -468 sinθ
then add 24cosθ + 36 sinθ:
so, total real part:
(300cosθ + 24cosθ) + (-468 sinθ + 36 sinθ)
= 324cosθ - 432 sinθ
so, the real part simplifies to 324cosθ - 432 sinθ
so, our goal is to maximize the expression 324cosθ - 432 sinθ
how do we maximize that?
let's recall that for an expression of the form a cosθ + b sinθ, the maximum value is sqrt(a2 + b2).
wait, but here it's 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, so it's a cosθ + b sinθ where a = 324 and b = -432.
therefore, the maximum is sqrt(3242 + (-432)2).
let me compute that.
first, compute 324 squared:
324 * 324. let's see:
300^2 = 90,000
24^2 = 576
2*300*24 = 14,400
so, (300 + 24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 + 24^2 = 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 104,976
therefore, 3242 = 104,976
now, 432 squared:
400^2 = 160,000
32^2 = 1,024
2*400*32 = 25,600
but wait, 432 = 400 + 32
so, (400 + 32)^2 = 400^2 + 2*400*32 + 32^2 = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 186,624
therefore, (-432)^2 = 186,624
therefore, sqrt(3242 + (-432)^2) = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600)
what's sqrt(291,600)?
let me compute this.
291,600. let's factor this:
291,600 divided by 100 is 2,916.
so sqrt(291,600) = sqrt(2,916 * 100) = sqrt(2,916)*sqrt(100) = 54*10 = 540
wait, because 54^2 = 2,916. yes, 50^2 = 2,500 and 54^2 = (50 +4)^2 = 2500 + 400 + 16 = 2,916.
therefore, sqrt(291,600) = 540.
therefore, the maximum real part is 540. hmm, so is that the answer? wait, but hold on.
wait, the expression is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, which can be written as r cos(theta + phi), where r is sqrt(3242 + 4322). wait, but since it's -432 sin(theta), the amplitude is sqrt(a2 + b2), regardless of the sign. yes, sqrt(3242 + (-432)^2) = sqrt(3242 + 4322) = 540.
therefore, the expression can be written as 540 cos(theta + phi), for some angle phi. therefore, the maximum value is 540, as the maximum of cosine is 1.
therefore, the maximum real part is 540.
wait, but before i jump to conclusions, let me confirm. let's check units and calculations.
original coefficients: (75, 117i) and (96, 144i)/z.
wait, when i converted (96 + 144i)/z, since |z|=4, we scaled it down by 16 (since dividing by z is multiplying by z̄/16). so (96 +144i)/16 = 6 + 9i. then, when adding the two terms: (75 +117i)z + (6 +9i)z̄.
then, if z = x + iy, then expression becomes (75 +117i)(x +iy) + (6 +9i)(x -iy).
let me compute that:
first term: (75 +117i)(x +iy) = 75x -117y + i(117x +75y)
second term: (6 +9i)(x - iy) = 6x +9y + i(9x -6y)
adding them together:
real parts: 75x -117y + 6x +9y = 81x -108y
imaginary parts: 117x +75y +9x -6y = 126x +69y
therefore, real part is 81x - 108y, and imaginary part is 126x +69y.
but since x and y are related by x2 + y2 = 16 (because |z|=4). so x and y are real numbers with x2 + y2 =16.
so, we need to maximize 81x -108y subject to x2 + y2 =16.
so, this is a standard optimization problem where we can use lagrange multipliers or recognize that the maximum value is the norm of the vector (81, -108) scaled by the radius.
since x2 + y2 =16, the variables x and y form a circle with radius 4. so, the expression 81x -108y is linear in x and y, and its maximum value is the magnitude of the vector (81, -108) multiplied by the radius 4.
wait, no, actually, in general, the maximum of a linear function ax + by on the circle x2 + y2 = r2 is r*sqrt(a2 + b2).
so here, plugging in, the maximum would be 4*sqrt(812 + 1082).
wait, but wait, the original variables x and y satisfy x2 + y2 =16, which is radius 4. so the maximum of 81x -108y is sqrt(812 + (-108)^2) * sqrt(16), wait no, radius is 4, so it's scaled by 4.
wait, more precisely, for the function f(x,y) = ax + by subject to x2 + y2 = r2, the maximum value is r*sqrt(a2 + b2).
wait, let's confirm.
for example, take a=1, b=0, radius r, then the maximum is r*1 at x=r, y=0. that's correct. similarly, in general.
so, the maximum of ax + by on x2 + y2 =r2 is r*sqrt(a2 + b2).
but in our case, it's 81x -108y, so a=81, b= -108, and r=4.
wait, but x2 + y2 =16, so r=4.
so the maximum is 4*sqrt(812 + (-108)^2).
compute that:
first, 812 = 6561
1082 = 11,664
so, sum is 6561 + 11,664 = 18,225
sqrt(18,225) = 135, because 135*135 = 18,225.
let's check: 1302 = 16,900. 1352 = (130 +5)^2 = 1302 + 2*130*5 +52 = 16,900 +1,300 +25 = 18,225.
yes, so sqrt(18,225) =135.
therefore, maximum value is 4 *135=540. so same result.
therefore, regardless of approach—whether through trigonometric substitution or through lagrange multipliers—the maximum real part is 540.
therefore, the answer is 540.
wait, but in my first approach, when i substituted z =4e^(iθ), i got the real part as 324 cosθ -432 sinθ, then found the maximum as 540. then in the second approach, representing z as x + yi, and maximizing 81x -108y over x2 + y2=16, the maximum is 4*sqrt(812 +1082)=4*135=540. both approaches concur. so, that's correct.
but, wait, just to be thorough, let's check if these two approaches are consistent.
in the first approach, i rewrote the expression over z=4e^(iθ), simplified the real part to 324 cosθ -432 sinθ, then took the maximum as sqrt(3242 +4322). but in the second approach, the real part was 81x -108y. how do 324 and 432 relate to 81 and -108? let's see.
wait, in the first approach, the real part was 324 cosθ -432 sinθ, and in the second, it was 81x -108y. but in the first approach, θ is the argument of z, while in the second approach, z =x + yi with x2 + y2=16.
wait, but how are θ and x, y related? if z=4e^(iθ), then x=4 cosθ, y=4 sinθ. so substituting into 81x -108y, we get 81*(4 cosθ) -108*(4 sinθ) = 324 cosθ -432 sinθ, which matches the first approach. so they are consistent.
therefore, both approaches correctly lead to the same expression, so the maximum is indeed 540.
therefore, the answer is 540. i can conclude that.
**final answer**

answer: to find the largest possible real part of the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\) where \(|z| = 4\), we start by parameterizing \(z\) as \(4e^{i\theta}\). 

first, we rewrite the expression in terms of \(z\) and its conjugate:
\[
(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}
\]
since \(|z| = 4\), we have \(\frac{1}{z} = \frac{\overline{z}}{16}\). substituting this in, the expression becomes:
\[
(75 + 117i)z + (6 + 9i)\overline{z}
\]

next, we express \(z\) as \(4(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)\) and \(\overline{z}\) as \(4(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta)\). substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[
4(75 + 117i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta)
\]

expanding both terms and combining the real parts, we find:
\[
4(75\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta) + 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta
\]

simplifying the real parts:
\[
4 \cdot 75\cos\theta + 4 \cdot (-117\sin\theta) + 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta
\]
\[
= (300\cos\theta + 24\cos\theta) + (-468\sin\theta + 36\sin\theta)
\]
\[
= 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta
\]

to maximize \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\), we use the fact that the maximum value of \(a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta\) is \(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\). here, \(a = 324\) and \(b = -432\):
\[
\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = \sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \sqrt{291600} = 540
\]

thus, the largest possible real part is:
\[
\boxed{540}
\]
