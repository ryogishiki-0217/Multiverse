Once I find that prime p, I then need to find the least positive integer m such that m4 + 1 is divisible by p4. Hmm, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly.

Wait, actually, the problem says "n4 + 1 is divisible by p2" and then once you find that p, find the least m such that m4 + 1 is divisible by p2. So both congruences are modulo p2, not p4. Maybe I misread that. Let me check again. The problem says: "Solve the following math problem: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n^{4}+1 is divisible by p^{2}". Find the least positive integer m such that m^{4}+1 is divisible by p^{2}."
So yes, both congruences are modulo p2. So first, I need to find the smallest prime p where p2 divides n4 +1 for some n, and then find the smallest m where p2 divides m4 +1. So the first step is to find such a prime p. The problem states that p is the least prime for which there exists an n with n4 ≡ -1 mod p2.

So if p2 divides n4 +1, then p must divide n4 +1. So first, maybe look at primes p where n4 ≡ -1 mod p has a solution, and then check if for such p, whether there's an n such that n4 ≡ -1 mod p2. Since the problem is asking for primes where p2 divides n4 +1, but the first step is to find primes where n4 ≡ -1 mod p, and then check the divisibility by p2. So perhaps starting with primes where -1 is a fourth power modulo p. That is, -1 must be a fourth power residue modulo p. Let's recall that for primes p, the multiplicative order of -1 modulo p must divide 4. Wait, not exactly.
Let me recall that if n4 ≡ -1 mod p, then n8 ≡ 1 mod p. Therefore, the multiplicative order of n modulo p divides 8. Moreover, since n4 ≡ -1 mod p, then the order does not divide 4, otherwise n4 ≡1 mod p, but here n4 ≡ -1 mod p. Therefore, the multiplicative order of n modulo p must be exactly 8. Therefore, 8 divides the order of the multiplicative group mod p, which is p-1. Therefore, p ≡ 1 mod 8. So primes congruent to 1 mod 8 are candidates. Let's think in parallel.

Therefore, primes p ≡1 mod 8. The primes start at 17, then 41, 73, etc. So perhaps 17 is the smallest such prime. But I need to check whether there exists an n such that n4 ≡ -1 mod 172. That is, whether n4 ≡ -1 mod 289 has a solution. If not, then we need to check the next prime, which is 41, then 73, etc. So perhaps 17 isn't good enough. Wait, but before assuming that, let me check. The fact that p ≡1 mod 8 is necessary, but maybe not sufficient for the congruence to lift to the modulus p2. So first, primes p ≡1 mod 8. So 17 is the smallest. Let's check 17 first. Let me check whether n4 ≡ -1 mod 17 has solutions. Since 17 is 1 mod 8, we can check if -1 is a fourth power mod 17. Alternatively, since the multiplicative order of n mod 17 is 8, we can check if 8 divides 16 (since 17-1=16). Since 8 divides 16, then there are elements of order 8 mod 17. Indeed, the multiplicative group mod 17 is cyclic of order 16, so it has elements of order 8. Therefore, for such an element n, n4 ≡ -1 mod 17. Because if n has order 8, then n8 ≡1 mod 17, so n8 -1 ≡0 mod 17, which factors as (n4 +1)(n4 -1)≡0 mod 17. Since n has order 8, n4 ≡ -1 mod 17, because n4 ≡1 would mean order 4, but the order is 8. Therefore, there are solutions to n4 ≡ -1 mod 17. So primes p=17 admit solutions mod p, but the question is whether these solutions lift to solutions mod p2. So we need to check if there is an n such that n4 ≡ -1 mod 172. So how do we check if a solution mod 17 can be lifted to a solution mod 172? Let's recall Hensel's lemma. Hensel's lemma allows lifting solutions from modulus p to p2 if certain conditions are met. Let's consider the polynomial f(n) = n4 +1. We want to solve f(n) ≡0 mod 172. Suppose we have a solution n0 mod 17, so that n04 ≡ -1 mod 17. Then, to lift this solution to modulus 172, we look for a solution of the form n = n0 + 17k. Then f(n) = (n0 + 17k)4 +1 ≡ n04 + 4*17k*n03 mod 172, since higher-order terms will be multiples of 172. Since n04 ≡ -1 mod 17, we have (n04 +1) = 17m for some integer m. Then, f(n) ≡ 17m + 4*17k*n03 mod 172. So to have f(n) ≡0 mod 172, we need 17m + 4*17k*n03 ≡0 mod 172, which is equivalent to 17(m + 4k*n03) ≡0 mod 172. Dividing by 17, we get m + 4k*n03 ≡0 mod 17. So we can solve for k: k ≡ -m*(4n03)^(-1) mod 17. Therefore, if 4n03 is invertible mod 17, which it is if n03 is invertible mod 17, which it is since n0 is a unit mod 17 (as n04 ≡ -1 mod 17 implies n0 is not divisible by 17). Therefore, since 4 and 17 are coprime, 4n03 has an inverse mod 17, so we can solve for k. Therefore, there exists a solution n mod 172 lifting n0 mod 17. Therefore, by Hensel's lemma, the solution can be lifted. Therefore, there exists an n such that n4 ≡ -1 mod 172. So p=17 is the prime we are looking for? But wait, Hensel's lemma gives that if f(n0) ≡0 mod p and f'(n0) ≡0 mod p, then lifting is not possible. But in our case, f(n) =n4 +1, so f'(n)=4n3. Then, if n0 is a solution mod p, then f'(n0)=4n03 mod p. Since n0 ≡? mod p, and p divides 17, if 4n03 ≡0 mod p, which would require p dividing 4 or n0. But p=17, which doesn't divide 4, and n0 is a solution to n4 ≡ -1 mod 17, so n0 is invertible mod 17. Therefore, f'(n0) =4n03 is invertible mod 17, hence the condition for Hensel's lemma is satisfied (f'(n0) not ≡0 mod p). Therefore, Hensel's lemma applies, and there exists a solution mod p2. Therefore, p=17 is the prime we are looking for, since it is the smallest prime congruent to 1 mod 8, and the solution can be lifted. But wait, hold on. Let me verify this with actual computation. Let's take p=17. First, find n0 such that n04 ≡ -1 mod 17. The multiplicative order of n0 is 8 mod 17. So let's find a primitive 8th root of unity mod 17. Let me first find a primitive root mod 17. A primitive root g mod 17 is an element whose order is 16. Let's see, 3 is a primitive root mod 17 because powers of 3 mod17: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^4=13, 3^8=1, so 3 is a primitive root. Therefore, 3^2=9. Then, 3^k where k is such that 3^k has order 8. Since the multiplicative group is cyclic of order 16, then 3^2 has order 16/gcd(2,16)=8. Therefore, 3^2=9 is an element of order 8 mod 17. Therefore, 9^4 ≡ (9^2)^2 ≡ (81 mod17)^2 ≡ (13)^2 ≡ 169 mod17 ≡ 169- 10*17=169-170=-1 mod17. Therefore, 9 is a solution to n^4 ≡ -1 mod17. So n0=9. Now, let's lift this solution to mod 172. So we need to find n =9 +17k such that n^4 ≡ -1 mod172. Let's write n =9 +17k and compute n^4 mod 289. First, note that 9 mod17=9, so n=9 +17k. Then, n =9 +17k. Then, n^4 = (9 +17k)^4. Expanding via the binomial theorem: n^4 = 9^4 + 4*9^3*(17k) + 6*(9^2)*(17k)^2 + 4*9*(17k)^3 + (17k)^4. Now, compute modulo 172=289. Let's compute each term modulo 289. First, 9^4: 9^2=81, 81^2=6561. 6561 divided by 289: 289*22=6358. So 6561 -6358=203. So 9^4≡203 mod289. Next term: 4*9^3*(17k). First, 9^3=729. 729 mod289: 289*2=578; 729-578=151. So 9^3≡151 mod289. Then, 4*151=604. 604 mod289: 604-289=315; 315-289=26. So 604≡26 mod289. Then, 26*17=442. So 26*17k=442k. But 442 mod289: 442-289=153. So 442k≡153k mod289. So the second term is 153k mod289. Next term: 6*(9^2)*(17k)^2. First, 9^2=81. Then, (17k)^2=289k2≡0 mod289. Therefore, 6*81*0=0 mod289. Similarly, the third and fourth terms: 4*9*(17k)^3 and (17k)^4 are all multiples of 173=4913, which is ≡0 mod289. Therefore, modulo 289, n^4 ≡ 203 +153k mod289. Therefore, we need n^4 ≡ -1 mod289, which is equivalent to 203 +153k ≡ -1 mod289. So 153k ≡ (-1 -203) ≡ -204 mod289. But -204 mod289 = 289-204=85. Therefore, 153k ≡85 mod289. So we need to solve 153k ≡85 mod289. Let's compute gcd(153,289). 289=172, 153=17*9. So gcd(153,289)=17. Since 17 divides 85 (because 85=17*5), the equation has solutions. Specifically, there are 17 solutions modulo289. To solve 153k ≡85 mod289. First, divide both sides by 17: 153/17=9, 85/17=5, so equation becomes 9k ≡5 mod (289/17)=17. So we need to solve 9k ≡5 mod17. The inverse of 9 mod17: We need to find x such that 9x≡1 mod17. Let's compute: 9*2=18≡1 mod17. So inverse is 2. Therefore, k ≡5*2≡10 mod17. So k=10 +17m. Therefore, substituting back: k=10 +17m. Therefore, the solutions are k≡10 mod17. Therefore, k=10 +17m. Therefore, n=9 +17k=9 +17*(10 +17m)=9 +170 +289m=179 +289m. Therefore, n≡179 mod289. So n=179 is a solution mod289. Let's check: Compute 179^4 mod289. First, let's compute 179 mod289. 179 is less than 289, so it's 179. Let's compute 179^2: 179^2 = (170+9)^2=1702 +2*170*9 +92=28900 +3060 +81=28900 +3060=31960 +81=32041. Now, compute 32041 mod289. Since 289*111=31929 (because 289*100=28900, 289*11=3179, so 289*111=28900 +3179=31929). Then, 32041 -31929=112. So 1792 ≡112 mod289. Now compute 179^4=(1792)^2≡1122 mod289. 1122=12544. Compute 12544 mod289: 289*43=12427 (since 289*40=11560, 289*3=867, 11560+867=12427). 12544 -12427=117. So 179^4≡117 mod289. Wait, but 117≡-1 mod289 would mean 117=-1 mod289, but -1 mod289 is 288. So 117 isn't equal to 288. So 179^4≡117 mod289, but 117-289=-172, which isn't zero. Wait, something's wrong here. Wait, but earlier calculation via expansion gave that n=179 is a solution. Wait, but when I expanded n=9 +17*10=9+170=179. Then, according to the expansion, n^4= (9 +17*10)^4, and we found that 203 +153*10=203+1530=1733. 1733 mod289: 289*6=1734. So 1733=1734-1≡-1 mod289. Ah, right! So 179^4≡-1 mod289. So indeed, 179 is a solution. Then my previous calculation must have been wrong. Let's check again. Wait, maybe my mistake was in the expansion. Let's recalculate n^4 for n=179 using another method. First, compute 179 mod17. 179 divided by17: 17*10=170, 179-170=9. So 179≡9 mod17. So n=179=9 mod17, so as per earlier, n^4≡9^4≡203 mod289. Wait, but 9^4=6561. 6561 divided by289: 289*22=6358, 6561-6358=203. So 9^4=203 mod289. But if n=179=9 +17*10, then n=9 +170. Then, n^4=9^4 +4*9^3*170 + ... + (170)^4. But modulo289, higher powers of17 will vanish. Wait, but let's compute n=179 as 179=170+9. Then: (170 +9)^4 = 170^4 +4*170^3*9 +6*170^2*9^2 +4*170*9^3 +9^4. Now, modulo289: 170^2=28900≡0 mod289, since 170=17*10, so 170^2=172*100=289*100≡0 mod289. Therefore, all terms with 170^2 or higher power are 0 mod289. Therefore, (170 +9)^4 ≡ 0 +0 +0 +4*170*9^3 +9^4 mod289. Compute 9^3=729. 729 mod289: 289*2=578, 729-578=151. So 9^3≡151 mod289. Then, 4*170*151 + 9^4. Compute 9^4=6561≡203 mod289 as before. Compute 4*170*151: First compute 4*170=680. 680 mod289: 289*2=578, 680-578=102. So 680≡102 mod289. Then 102*151: Compute 102*151=102*(150 +1)=102*150 +102=15300 +102=15402. 15402 divided by289: 289*53=15357 (since 289*50=14450, 289*3=867, 14450 +867=15317. Wait, no, 289*53=289*(50+3)=289*50 +289*3=14450 +867=15317. 15402 -15317=85. Therefore, 15402≡85 mod289. Therefore, 4*170*151≡85 mod289. Then, adding 9^4≡203 mod289. So total is 85 +203=288≡-1 mod289. So indeed, 179^4≡-1 mod289. Therefore, n=179 is a solution mod289. Therefore, p=17 is the prime we are looking for. Therefore, the first part is answered: p=17. Now, the problem asks to find the least positive integer m such that m4 +1 is divisible by p2=172=289. So we need to find the smallest m>0 with m4 ≡ -1 mod289. From the previous computation, we found that m=179 is a solution. However, 179 might not be the minimal one. Let's check smaller values. Wait, perhaps there are smaller m. Let me check m=179. Since 179 is congruent to 179 mod289, which is between 1 and289. Let's check if there's an m less than179 that satisfies the congruence. Alternatively, maybe m=9 +17k gives a smaller solution. Wait, in the lifting step, we found that k=10 +17m gives solutions. So the minimal k is10, so n=9 +17*10=179. Alternatively, k=10-17= -7 would give n=9 +17*(-7)=9 -119= -110 ≡179 mod289. So 179 is the minimal positive residue. Wait, but is there another solution coming from different initial solutions mod17? Wait, we started with n0=9 mod17. Are there other solutions mod17? Since in the multiplicative group mod17, which is cyclic of order16, the elements of order8 are generated by g^2, where g is a primitive root. So if 3 is a primitive root, then 3^2=9, and 3^6=729 mod17. 729 divided by17: 17*43=711, so 729-711=18. So 3^6=18 mod17=1 mod17? Wait, 729 mod17. Let me compute 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^4=81 mod17=13, 3^8=13^2=169 mod17=169-10*17=169-170=-1. So 3^16=1. So 3^6=3^(4+2)= (3^4)^2 *3^2=13^2 *9=169*9 mod17. 169 mod17=169-10*17=169-170=-1, so 169*9= (-1)*9=-9 mod17. So 3^6≡-9 mod17. So 3^6=8 mod17? Wait, 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27≡10 mod17, 3^4=30≡13 mod17, 3^5=39≡5 mod17, 3^6=15 mod17, 3^7=45≡11 mod17, 3^8=33≡16 mod17, which is -1. So elements of order8 would be 3^2=9, 3^6=15, etc. Wait, 3^2=9, order8. Then 9^4= (9^2)^2= (13)^2=169= -1 mod17. Similarly, 15^4= (15^2)^2= (225 mod17)2. 225 mod17: 17*13=221, 225-221=4, so 15^2≡4 mod17. Then, 4^2=16≡-1 mod17. Therefore, 15 is another solution mod17. Therefore, n0=15 is another solution. So maybe we can lift this n0=15 mod17 to a solution mod289. Let's try. Let n=15 +17k. Then, n^4 ≡ (15 +17k)^4 mod289. Again, expanding: n^4=15^4 +4*15^3*17k + ... Similarly, higher terms will be multiples of (17k)^2, which is 0 mod289. So n^4 ≡15^4 +4*15^3*17k mod289. Compute 15^4 mod289. 15^2=225, 15^4=225^2=50625. 50625 divided by289: 289*175=289*(170+5)=289*170 +289*5=49130 +1445=50575. 50625 -50575=50. So 15^4≡50 mod289. Next term: 4*15^3*17k. First, compute 15^3=3375. 3375 mod289: 289*11=3179. 3375 -3179=196. So 15^3≡196 mod289. Then, 4*196=784. 784 mod289: 289*2=578, 784-578=206. So 784≡206 mod289. Then, 206*17=3492. 3492 mod289: 289*12=3468. 3492-3468=24. So 206*17≡24 mod289. Therefore, the second term is 24k mod289. Therefore, n^4≡50 +24k mod289. We need n^4≡-1 mod289, so 50 +24k ≡-1 mod289. Then, 24k≡-51 mod289. Which is 24k≡238 mod289. Since -51 mod289=238. So 24k≡238 mod289. Compute gcd(24,289). Since 289 is 172 and 24 and 17 are coprime, gcd(24,289)=1. Therefore, the equation has a unique solution modulo289. Solve for k: 24k≡238 mod289. Multiply both sides by the inverse of24 mod289. Need to find x such that24x≡1 mod289. Using extended Euclidean algorithm: 289=24*12 +1. 24=24*1 +0. Then, 1=289 -24*12. Thus, -12*24 ≡1 mod289. Therefore, the inverse of24 mod289 is-12 mod289=277. Therefore, k≡238*277 mod289. Compute 238*277 mod289. Note that238 mod289=238, 277 mod289=277. Let's compute 238*277: First, 238*(200 +70 +7)=238*200 +238*70 +238*7. 238*200=47600. 238*70=16660. 238*7=1666. Total=47600 +16660=64260 +1666=64260+1666=65926. Now, compute65926 mod289. First, note that289*227=289*(200 +27)=289*200 +289*27=57800 +7803=65603. 65926 -65603=323. 323 mod289=323-289=34. Therefore, 238*277≡34 mod289. So k≡34 mod289. Therefore, n=15 +17*34=15 +578=593. But 593 mod289: 289*2=578, 593-578=15. So n≡15 mod289. Wait, but that's the same as the original solution mod17. Wait, no, if k=34, then n=15 +17*34=15 +578=593=15 +289*2 + ... Wait, 17*34=578=2*289=578. So 15 +578=15 +2*289=15 +578=593. But 593-2*289=593-578=15. So n≡15 mod289. So lifting n0=15 mod17 gives n=15 mod289. But 15^4≡50 mod289, which is not -1. Wait, but that contradicts. Wait, but earlier, when expanding n=15 +17k, I found that n^4 ≡50 +24k mod289. Then, to have ≡-1 mod289, we need 50 +24k ≡-1 mod289, so 24k≡-51 mod289, leading to k≡34 mod289. But 17k=17*34=578=2*289, so n=15 +578=15 + 2*289 ≡15 mod289. Therefore, n=15. But 15 is the original solution mod17, but 15^4≡50 mod289, which is not -1. So that approach gives a contradiction. Wait, perhaps miscalculations here. Wait, the equation was 24k≡238 mod289. So multiplying by inverse of24 which is277: k≡238*277 mod289. But my calculation showed 238*277≡34 mod289, leading to k=34. Then, n=15 +17*34=15 +578=593≡15 mod289. But 15^4≡50 mod289, which is not -1. Therefore, something is wrong here. Wait, but in the previous step, when n=15 +17k, expanding gives n^4≡15^4 +4*15^3*17k mod289. But 15^4=50 mod289. 4*15^3*17k=4*(15^3)*17k. Compute 15^3=3375. 3375 mod289: as

okay, so i have this problem here that asks me to find the least prime number p for which there exists a positive integer n such that n4 + 1 is divisible by p2. once i find that prime p, i then need to find the least positive integer m such that m4 + 1 is divisible by p4. hmm, let me make sure i understand the problem correctly.

wait, actually, the problem says "n4 + 1 is divisible by p2" and then once you find that p, find the least m such that m4 + 1 is divisible by p2. so both congruences are modulo p2, not p4. maybe i misread that. let me check again. the problem says: "solve the following math problem: let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n^{4}+1 is divisible by p^{2}". find the least positive integer m such that m^{4}+1 is divisible by p^{2}."
so yes, both congruences are modulo p2. so first, i need to find the smallest prime p where p2 divides n4 +1 for some n, and then find the smallest m where p2 divides m4 +1. so the first step is to find such a prime p. the problem states that p is the least prime for which there exists an n with n4 ≡ -1 mod p2.

so if p2 divides n4 +1, then p must divide n4 +1. so first, maybe look at primes p where n4 ≡ -1 mod p has a solution, and then check if for such p, whether there's an n such that n4 ≡ -1 mod p2. since the problem is asking for primes where p2 divides n4 +1, but the first step is to find primes where n4 ≡ -1 mod p, and then check the divisibility by p2. so perhaps starting with primes where -1 is a fourth power modulo p. that is, -1 must be a fourth power residue modulo p. let's recall that for primes p, the multiplicative order of -1 modulo p must divide 4. wait, not exactly.
let me recall that if n4 ≡ -1 mod p, then n8 ≡ 1 mod p. therefore, the multiplicative order of n modulo p divides 8. moreover, since n4 ≡ -1 mod p, then the order does not divide 4, otherwise n4 ≡1 mod p, but here n4 ≡ -1 mod p. therefore, the multiplicative order of n modulo p must be exactly 8. therefore, 8 divides the order of the multiplicative group mod p, which is p-1. therefore, p ≡ 1 mod 8. so primes congruent to 1 mod 8 are candidates. let's think in parallel.

therefore, primes p ≡1 mod 8. the primes start at 17, then 41, 73, etc. so perhaps 17 is the smallest such prime. but i need to check whether there exists an n such that n4 ≡ -1 mod 172. that is, whether n4 ≡ -1 mod 289 has a solution. if not, then we need to check the next prime, which is 41, then 73, etc. so perhaps 17 isn't good enough. wait, but before assuming that, let me check. the fact that p ≡1 mod 8 is necessary, but maybe not sufficient for the congruence to lift to the modulus p2. so first, primes p ≡1 mod 8. so 17 is the smallest. let's check 17 first. let me check whether n4 ≡ -1 mod 17 has solutions. since 17 is 1 mod 8, we can check if -1 is a fourth power mod 17. alternatively, since the multiplicative order of n mod 17 is 8, we can check if 8 divides 16 (since 17-1=16). since 8 divides 16, then there are elements of order 8 mod 17. indeed, the multiplicative group mod 17 is cyclic of order 16, so it has elements of order 8. therefore, for such an element n, n4 ≡ -1 mod 17. because if n has order 8, then n8 ≡1 mod 17, so n8 -1 ≡0 mod 17, which factors as (n4 +1)(n4 -1)≡0 mod 17. since n has order 8, n4 ≡ -1 mod 17, because n4 ≡1 would mean order 4, but the order is 8. therefore, there are solutions to n4 ≡ -1 mod 17. so primes p=17 admit solutions mod p, but the question is whether these solutions lift to solutions mod p2. so we need to check if there is an n such that n4 ≡ -1 mod 172. so how do we check if a solution mod 17 can be lifted to a solution mod 172? let's recall hensel's lemma. hensel's lemma allows lifting solutions from modulus p to p2 if certain conditions are met. let's consider the polynomial f(n) = n4 +1. we want to solve f(n) ≡0 mod 172. suppose we have a solution n0 mod 17, so that n04 ≡ -1 mod 17. then, to lift this solution to modulus 172, we look for a solution of the form n = n0 + 17k. then f(n) = (n0 + 17k)4 +1 ≡ n04 + 4*17k*n03 mod 172, since higher-order terms will be multiples of 172. since n04 ≡ -1 mod 17, we have (n04 +1) = 17m for some integer m. then, f(n) ≡ 17m + 4*17k*n03 mod 172. so to have f(n) ≡0 mod 172, we need 17m + 4*17k*n03 ≡0 mod 172, which is equivalent to 17(m + 4k*n03) ≡0 mod 172. dividing by 17, we get m + 4k*n03 ≡0 mod 17. so we can solve for k: k ≡ -m*(4n03)^(-1) mod 17. therefore, if 4n03 is invertible mod 17, which it is if n03 is invertible mod 17, which it is since n0 is a unit mod 17 (as n04 ≡ -1 mod 17 implies n0 is not divisible by 17). therefore, since 4 and 17 are coprime, 4n03 has an inverse mod 17, so we can solve for k. therefore, there exists a solution n mod 172 lifting n0 mod 17. therefore, by hensel's lemma, the solution can be lifted. therefore, there exists an n such that n4 ≡ -1 mod 172. so p=17 is the prime we are looking for? but wait, hensel's lemma gives that if f(n0) ≡0 mod p and f'(n0) ≡0 mod p, then lifting is not possible. but in our case, f(n) =n4 +1, so f'(n)=4n3. then, if n0 is a solution mod p, then f'(n0)=4n03 mod p. since n0 ≡? mod p, and p divides 17, if 4n03 ≡0 mod p, which would require p dividing 4 or n0. but p=17, which doesn't divide 4, and n0 is a solution to n4 ≡ -1 mod 17, so n0 is invertible mod 17. therefore, f'(n0) =4n03 is invertible mod 17, hence the condition for hensel's lemma is satisfied (f'(n0) not ≡0 mod p). therefore, hensel's lemma applies, and there exists a solution mod p2. therefore, p=17 is the prime we are looking for, since it is the smallest prime congruent to 1 mod 8, and the solution can be lifted. but wait, hold on. let me verify this with actual computation. let's take p=17. first, find n0 such that n04 ≡ -1 mod 17. the multiplicative order of n0 is 8 mod 17. so let's find a primitive 8th root of unity mod 17. let me first find a primitive root mod 17. a primitive root g mod 17 is an element whose order is 16. let's see, 3 is a primitive root mod 17 because powers of 3 mod17: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^4=13, 3^8=1, so 3 is a primitive root. therefore, 3^2=9. then, 3^k where k is such that 3^k has order 8. since the multiplicative group is cyclic of order 16, then 3^2 has order 16/gcd(2,16)=8. therefore, 3^2=9 is an element of order 8 mod 17. therefore, 9^4 ≡ (9^2)^2 ≡ (81 mod17)^2 ≡ (13)^2 ≡ 169 mod17 ≡ 169- 10*17=169-170=-1 mod17. therefore, 9 is a solution to n^4 ≡ -1 mod17. so n0=9. now, let's lift this solution to mod 172. so we need to find n =9 +17k such that n^4 ≡ -1 mod172. let's write n =9 +17k and compute n^4 mod 289. first, note that 9 mod17=9, so n=9 +17k. then, n =9 +17k. then, n^4 = (9 +17k)^4. expanding via the binomial theorem: n^4 = 9^4 + 4*9^3*(17k) + 6*(9^2)*(17k)^2 + 4*9*(17k)^3 + (17k)^4. now, compute modulo 172=289. let's compute each term modulo 289. first, 9^4: 9^2=81, 81^2=6561. 6561 divided by 289: 289*22=6358. so 6561 -6358=203. so 9^4≡203 mod289. next term: 4*9^3*(17k). first, 9^3=729. 729 mod289: 289*2=578; 729-578=151. so 9^3≡151 mod289. then, 4*151=604. 604 mod289: 604-289=315; 315-289=26. so 604≡26 mod289. then, 26*17=442. so 26*17k=442k. but 442 mod289: 442-289=153. so 442k≡153k mod289. so the second term is 153k mod289. next term: 6*(9^2)*(17k)^2. first, 9^2=81. then, (17k)^2=289k2≡0 mod289. therefore, 6*81*0=0 mod289. similarly, the third and fourth terms: 4*9*(17k)^3 and (17k)^4 are all multiples of 173=4913, which is ≡0 mod289. therefore, modulo 289, n^4 ≡ 203 +153k mod289. therefore, we need n^4 ≡ -1 mod289, which is equivalent to 203 +153k ≡ -1 mod289. so 153k ≡ (-1 -203) ≡ -204 mod289. but -204 mod289 = 289-204=85. therefore, 153k ≡85 mod289. so we need to solve 153k ≡85 mod289. let's compute gcd(153,289). 289=172, 153=17*9. so gcd(153,289)=17. since 17 divides 85 (because 85=17*5), the equation has solutions. specifically, there are 17 solutions modulo289. to solve 153k ≡85 mod289. first, divide both sides by 17: 153/17=9, 85/17=5, so equation becomes 9k ≡5 mod (289/17)=17. so we need to solve 9k ≡5 mod17. the inverse of 9 mod17: we need to find x such that 9x≡1 mod17. let's compute: 9*2=18≡1 mod17. so inverse is 2. therefore, k ≡5*2≡10 mod17. so k=10 +17m. therefore, substituting back: k=10 +17m. therefore, the solutions are k≡10 mod17. therefore, k=10 +17m. therefore, n=9 +17k=9 +17*(10 +17m)=9 +170 +289m=179 +289m. therefore, n≡179 mod289. so n=179 is a solution mod289. let's check: compute 179^4 mod289. first, let's compute 179 mod289. 179 is less than 289, so it's 179. let's compute 179^2: 179^2 = (170+9)^2=1702 +2*170*9 +92=28900 +3060 +81=28900 +3060=31960 +81=32041. now, compute 32041 mod289. since 289*111=31929 (because 289*100=28900, 289*11=3179, so 289*111=28900 +3179=31929). then, 32041 -31929=112. so 1792 ≡112 mod289. now compute 179^4=(1792)^2≡1122 mod289. 1122=12544. compute 12544 mod289: 289*43=12427 (since 289*40=11560, 289*3=867, 11560+867=12427). 12544 -12427=117. so 179^4≡117 mod289. wait, but 117≡-1 mod289 would mean 117=-1 mod289, but -1 mod289 is 288. so 117 isn't equal to 288. so 179^4≡117 mod289, but 117-289=-172, which isn't zero. wait, something's wrong here. wait, but earlier calculation via expansion gave that n=179 is a solution. wait, but when i expanded n=9 +17*10=9+170=179. then, according to the expansion, n^4= (9 +17*10)^4, and we found that 203 +153*10=203+1530=1733. 1733 mod289: 289*6=1734. so 1733=1734-1≡-1 mod289. ah, right! so 179^4≡-1 mod289. so indeed, 179 is a solution. then my previous calculation must have been wrong. let's check again. wait, maybe my mistake was in the expansion. let's recalculate n^4 for n=179 using another method. first, compute 179 mod17. 179 divided by17: 17*10=170, 179-170=9. so 179≡9 mod17. so n=179=9 mod17, so as per earlier, n^4≡9^4≡203 mod289. wait, but 9^4=6561. 6561 divided by289: 289*22=6358, 6561-6358=203. so 9^4=203 mod289. but if n=179=9 +17*10, then n=9 +170. then, n^4=9^4 +4*9^3*170 + ... + (170)^4. but modulo289, higher powers of17 will vanish. wait, but let's compute n=179 as 179=170+9. then: (170 +9)^4 = 170^4 +4*170^3*9 +6*170^2*9^2 +4*170*9^3 +9^4. now, modulo289: 170^2=28900≡0 mod289, since 170=17*10, so 170^2=172*100=289*100≡0 mod289. therefore, all terms with 170^2 or higher power are 0 mod289. therefore, (170 +9)^4 ≡ 0 +0 +0 +4*170*9^3 +9^4 mod289. compute 9^3=729. 729 mod289: 289*2=578, 729-578=151. so 9^3≡151 mod289. then, 4*170*151 + 9^4. compute 9^4=6561≡203 mod289 as before. compute 4*170*151: first compute 4*170=680. 680 mod289: 289*2=578, 680-578=102. so 680≡102 mod289. then 102*151: compute 102*151=102*(150 +1)=102*150 +102=15300 +102=15402. 15402 divided by289: 289*53=15357 (since 289*50=14450, 289*3=867, 14450 +867=15317. wait, no, 289*53=289*(50+3)=289*50 +289*3=14450 +867=15317. 15402 -15317=85. therefore, 15402≡85 mod289. therefore, 4*170*151≡85 mod289. then, adding 9^4≡203 mod289. so total is 85 +203=288≡-1 mod289. so indeed, 179^4≡-1 mod289. therefore, n=179 is a solution mod289. therefore, p=17 is the prime we are looking for. therefore, the first part is answered: p=17. now, the problem asks to find the least positive integer m such that m4 +1 is divisible by p2=172=289. so we need to find the smallest m>0 with m4 ≡ -1 mod289. from the previous computation, we found that m=179 is a solution. however, 179 might not be the minimal one. let's check smaller values. wait, perhaps there are smaller m. let me check m=179. since 179 is congruent to 179 mod289, which is between 1 and289. let's check if there's an m less than179 that satisfies the congruence. alternatively, maybe m=9 +17k gives a smaller solution. wait, in the lifting step, we found that k=10 +17m gives solutions. so the minimal k is10, so n=9 +17*10=179. alternatively, k=10-17= -7 would give n=9 +17*(-7)=9 -119= -110 ≡179 mod289. so 179 is the minimal positive residue. wait, but is there another solution coming from different initial solutions mod17? wait, we started with n0=9 mod17. are there other solutions mod17? since in the multiplicative group mod17, which is cyclic of order16, the elements of order8 are generated by g^2, where g is a primitive root. so if 3 is a primitive root, then 3^2=9, and 3^6=729 mod17. 729 divided by17: 17*43=711, so 729-711=18. so 3^6=18 mod17=1 mod17? wait, 729 mod17. let me compute 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^4=81 mod17=13, 3^8=13^2=169 mod17=169-10*17=169-170=-1. so 3^16=1. so 3^6=3^(4+2)= (3^4)^2 *3^2=13^2 *9=169*9 mod17. 169 mod17=169-10*17=169-170=-1, so 169*9= (-1)*9=-9 mod17. so 3^6≡-9 mod17. so 3^6=8 mod17? wait, 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27≡10 mod17, 3^4=30≡13 mod17, 3^5=39≡5 mod17, 3^6=15 mod17, 3^7=45≡11 mod17, 3^8=33≡16 mod17, which is -1. so elements of order8 would be 3^2=9, 3^6=15, etc. wait, 3^2=9, order8. then 9^4= (9^2)^2= (13)^2=169= -1 mod17. similarly, 15^4= (15^2)^2= (225 mod17)2. 225 mod17: 17*13=221, 225-221=4, so 15^2≡4 mod17. then, 4^2=16≡-1 mod17. therefore, 15 is another solution mod17. therefore, n0=15 is another solution. so maybe we can lift this n0=15 mod17 to a solution mod289. let's try. let n=15 +17k. then, n^4 ≡ (15 +17k)^4 mod289. again, expanding: n^4=15^4 +4*15^3*17k + ... similarly, higher terms will be multiples of (17k)^2, which is 0 mod289. so n^4 ≡15^4 +4*15^3*17k mod289. compute 15^4 mod289. 15^2=225, 15^4=225^2=50625. 50625 divided by289: 289*175=289*(170+5)=289*170 +289*5=49130 +1445=50575. 50625 -50575=50. so 15^4≡50 mod289. next term: 4*15^3*17k. first, compute 15^3=3375. 3375 mod289: 289*11=3179. 3375 -3179=196. so 15^3≡196 mod289. then, 4*196=784. 784 mod289: 289*2=578, 784-578=206. so 784≡206 mod289. then, 206*17=3492. 3492 mod289: 289*12=3468. 3492-3468=24. so 206*17≡24 mod289. therefore, the second term is 24k mod289. therefore, n^4≡50 +24k mod289. we need n^4≡-1 mod289, so 50 +24k ≡-1 mod289. then, 24k≡-51 mod289. which is 24k≡238 mod289. since -51 mod289=238. so 24k≡238 mod289. compute gcd(24,289). since 289 is 172 and 24 and 17 are coprime, gcd(24,289)=1. therefore, the equation has a unique solution modulo289. solve for k: 24k≡238 mod289. multiply both sides by the inverse of24 mod289. need to find x such that24x≡1 mod289. using extended euclidean algorithm: 289=24*12 +1. 24=24*1 +0. then, 1=289 -24*12. thus, -12*24 ≡1 mod289. therefore, the inverse of24 mod289 is-12 mod289=277. therefore, k≡238*277 mod289. compute 238*277 mod289. note that238 mod289=238, 277 mod289=277. let's compute 238*277: first, 238*(200 +70 +7)=238*200 +238*70 +238*7. 238*200=47600. 238*70=16660. 238*7=1666. total=47600 +16660=64260 +1666=64260+1666=65926. now, compute65926 mod289. first, note that289*227=289*(200 +27)=289*200 +289*27=57800 +7803=65603. 65926 -65603=323. 323 mod289=323-289=34. therefore, 238*277≡34 mod289. so k≡34 mod289. therefore, n=15 +17*34=15 +578=593. but 593 mod289: 289*2=578, 593-578=15. so n≡15 mod289. wait, but that's the same as the original solution mod17. wait, no, if k=34, then n=15 +17*34=15 +578=593=15 +289*2 + ... wait, 17*34=578=2*289=578. so 15 +578=15 +2*289=15 +578=593. but 593-2*289=593-578=15. so n≡15 mod289. so lifting n0=15 mod17 gives n=15 mod289. but 15^4≡50 mod289, which is not -1. wait, but that contradicts. wait, but earlier, when expanding n=15 +17k, i found that n^4 ≡50 +24k mod289. then, to have ≡-1 mod289, we need 50 +24k ≡-1 mod289, so 24k≡-51 mod289, leading to k≡34 mod289. but 17k=17*34=578=2*289, so n=15 +578=15 + 2*289 ≡15 mod289. therefore, n=15. but 15 is the original solution mod17, but 15^4≡50 mod289, which is not -1. so that approach gives a contradiction. wait, perhaps miscalculations here. wait, the equation was 24k≡238 mod289. so multiplying by inverse of24 which is277: k≡238*277 mod289. but my calculation showed 238*277≡34 mod289, leading to k=34. then, n=15 +17*34=15 +578=593≡15 mod289. but 15^4≡50 mod289, which is not -1. therefore, something is wrong here. wait, but in the previous step, when n=15 +17k, expanding gives n^4≡15^4 +4*15^3*17k mod289. but 15^4=50 mod289. 4*15^3*17k=4*(15^3)*17k. compute 15^3=3375. 3375 mod289: as
