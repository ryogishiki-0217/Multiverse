问题: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).

Solve the following math problem: Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\).

Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to find the value of \(OC^2\) where \(C\) is a specific point on the line segment \(\overline{AB}\). Let me first parse all the given information step by step.
First, there are points O, A, and B defined: O is at (0,0), which is the origin. A is at (1/2, 0), so it's on the x-axis halfway between the origin and (1,0). B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2), so it's on the y-axis. Let me note that sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866, which is the y-coordinate. So point B is a bit less than 1 unit up the y-axis.
