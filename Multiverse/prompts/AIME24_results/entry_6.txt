Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths: AB = CD = √41, AC = BD = √80, and BC = AD = √89. There's a point I inside the tetrahedron that's equidistant from all four faces. The question is asking for the distance from this point to each face, which is given in the form m√n / p, and then to find m + n + p.
Hmm, okay. Let me think. First, I need to recall what kind of point in a tetrahedron is equidistant from all four faces. That sounds like the inradius of the tetrahedron, right? Just like in a triangle, the inradius is the distance from the incenter to each side. So for a tetrahedron, the inradius is the distance from the incenter (the point where the angle bisectors meet?) to each face. But I'm not 100% sure about the analog in three dimensions. But given that the problem mentions such a point exists inside the tetrahedron, I'll go with that. So the problem reduces to finding the inradius of this tetrahedron.
But how do we compute the inradius of a tetrahedron? Let's think. In a triangle, the inradius is equal to the area divided by the semiperimeter. Is there an analogous formula for a tetrahedron? Maybe the inradius is equal to the volume divided by the surface area? Not exactly, because in three dimensions, the surface area is area, and the volume is volume, so the units wouldn't work out. Wait, actually, for a polygon in 2D, inradius has units of length, area is length squared, and perimeter is length. So inradius = area / semiperimeter. In 3D, the inradius would have units of length, volume has units of length cubed, surface area is length squared. If we take volume / surface area, the units would be length cubed / length squared = length, which matches. So maybe the inradius is equal to the volume divided by the surface area? Hmm, but is that true? Let me check.
Wait, actually, for a polyhedron, the volume can be expressed as the inradius multiplied by the surface area divided by 3. Because each face contributes a volume of (area of face) * inradius / 3. Summing over all faces gives total volume = (surface area) * inradius / 3. Therefore, inradius = (3 * volume) / surface area. So yes, that makes sense. So in three dimensions, the inradius is three times the volume divided by the surface area. So to find the inradius, I need to compute the volume of the tetrahedron and the surface area (which is the sum of the areas of all four faces).
Therefore, the plan is: 1. Compute the areas of all four faces of the tetrahedron to get the surface area. 2. Compute the volume of the tetrahedron. 3. Divide 3 times the volume by the surface area to get the inradius.
Alright, let's start with computing the areas of the faces. The edges given are: AB = √41, AC = √80, AD = √89 BC = √89, BD = √80, CD = √41
Wait, so ABCD is a tetrahedron with six edges. But the problem gives AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD. So those are all six edges. So we have: AB = √41, CD = √41 AC = √80, BD = √80 AD = √89, BC = √89
So the edges opposite each other are equal. That is, AB = CD, AC = BD, AD = BC. Interesting. So the tetrahedron is equidimensional or something? Not sure if that has a specific name. Maybe a kind of disphenoid? I recall that a disphenoid is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal, and the faces are congruent. Maybe that's the case here. Let me check if the faces are congruent.

2: Face ACD has sides AC = √80, CD = √41, and AD = √89. The semiperimeter of face ACD is (sqrt(80) + sqrt(41) + sqrt(89))/2, which is approximately 19.13. The area of face ACD is calculated using Heron's formula: sqrt(s(s - AC)(s - CD)(s - AD)).

The area of face BCD is thus 10.

Wait, maybe all the faces have the same area? Because the tetrahedron is kind of symmetric with opposite edges equal. So if it's a disphenoid, then all four faces are congruent. Let me check. If AB = CD, AC = BD, AD = BC, then indeed, the faces opposite each other are congruent. Wait, ABC is congruent to D-ones. Let me see: Face ABC has edges AB, BC, AC: √41, √89, √80. Face ACD has edges AC, CD, AD: √80, √41, √89. So same edge lengths, so congruent. Similarly, face ABD has edges AB, BD, AD: √41, √80, √89. Which is the same as face ABC's edges. So all four faces are congruent. Therefore, each face has the same area. Therefore, once I compute the area of one face, I can multiply by 4 to get the total surface area.
That simplifies things. So let's compute the area of one face, say, ABC. The sides are AB = √41, BC = √89, AC = √80. Let me use Heron's formula. First, compute the semi-perimeter: s = (AB + BC + AC)/2 = (√41 + √89 + √80)/2. Then area = √[s(s - AB)(s - BC)(s - AC)].
But maybe there's a better way. Maybe coordinates? Since the edge lengths are given, perhaps assign coordinates to the points A, B, C, D and compute the volume and areas that way.
That might be more straightforward. Let's try that approach. The idea is to place the tetrahedron in 3D space with coordinates such that the edge lengths are satisfied, then compute volume and areas via coordinates. To do this, we can fix points A, B, C, D in space with appropriate coordinates. Since opposite edges are equal, maybe there's some symmetry. Alternatively, start by placing point A at (0,0,0), B at some point along the x-axis, etc.
Wait, in such problems, it's often useful to use coordinate systems where certain points lie along axes. Let me try. Let's set point A at (0,0,0). Let's set point B along the x-axis, so B is at (x, 0, 0). Let point C be in the xy-plane for simplicity, so C is at (a, b, 0). Then point D will be somewhere in 3D space (p, q, r).
Now, we need to determine coordinates such that all the given edge lengths are satisfied. Let's try this step by step.
Given edges: AB = √41, so since A is (0,0,0) and B is (x,0,0), AB = x = √41. So x = √41. So B is (√41, 0, 0).
Next, AC = √80. Since A is (0,0,0), AC = sqrt(a^2 + b^2 + 0) = sqrt(a^2 + b^2) = √80. So a2 + b2 = 80.
BC = √89. Since B is (√41, 0,0) and C is (a, b, 0), BC = sqrt((a - √41)^2 + (b - 0)^2) = sqrt((a - √41)^2 + b2) = √89. Therefore, (a - √41)^2 + b2 = 89.
But we already know that a2 + b2 = 80. So substituting, (a - √41)^2 + b2 = (a2 - 2a√41 + 41) + b2 = (a2 + b2) - 2a√41 + 41 = 80 - 2a√41 + 41 = 121 - 2a√41 = 89.
Therefore, 121 - 2a√41 = 89 => -2a√41 = 89 - 121 = -32 => 2a√41 = 32 => a√41 = 16 => a = 16/√41.
So a = 16/√41, and since a2 + b2 = 80, then b2 = 80 - (256)/41 = (3280 - 256)/41 = 3024/41. Wait, 80 = 3280/41, so 3280/41 - 256/41 = (3280 - 256)/41 = 3024/41. Therefore, b = sqrt(3024/41) = sqrt(3024)/sqrt(41) = sqrt(16 * 189)/sqrt(41) = 4*sqrt(189)/sqrt(41) = 4*sqrt(189/41).
But sqrt(189) is sqrt(9*21) = 3*sqrt(21). So 4*3*sqrt(21)/sqrt(41) = 12*sqrt(21)/sqrt(41). Therefore, b = 12√(21)/√41.
Therefore, point C is at (16/√41, 12√21/√41, 0).
Hmm, getting complicated, but okay. Now, point D needs to satisfy AD = BC = √89, BD = AC = √80, and CD = AB = √41.

1: The coordinates of point D are (p, q, r). The edge length conditions are AD = √89, BD = √80, and CD = √√41. The distance AD from A(0,0,0) to D(p,q,r) is sqrt(p^2 + q^2 + r^2) = sqrt(89), which implies p^2 + q^2 + r^2 = 89. The distance BD from B(√41,0,0) to D(p,q,r) is sqrt((p - sqrt(41))^2 + q^2 + r^2) = sqrt(80), leading to (p - sqrt(41))^2 + q^2 + r^2 = 80. The distance CD from C(16/sqrt(41), 12*sqrt(21)/sqrt(41), 0) to D(p,q,r) is sqrt((p - 16/sqrt(41))^2 + (q - 12*sqrt(21)/sqrt(41))^2 + r^2) = sqrt(41), resulting in (p - 16/sqrt(41))^2 + (q - 12*sqrt(21)/sqrt(41))^2 + r^2 = 41.
Subtracting the equation p^2 + q^2 + r^2 = 89 from the equation (p - sqrt(41))^2 + q^2 + r^2 = 80 yields -2p*sqrt(41) + 41 = -9, simplifying to -2p*sqrt(41) = -130, and solving gives p = 65/sqrt(41).
Subtracting the equation p^2 + q^2 + r^2 = 89 from the equation (p - 16/sqrt(41))^2 + (q - 12*sqrt(21)/sqrt(41))^2 + r^2 = 41 results in the equation -32p/sqrt(41) - 24q*sqrt(21)/sqrt(41) + 400/41 = -48.
Substituting p = 65/sqrt(41) into the equation -32p/sqrt(41) - 24q*sqrt(21)/sqrt(41) + 400/41 = -48 yields -32*(65/sqrt(41))/sqrt(41) - 24q*sqrt(21)/sqrt(41) + 400/41 = -48.
The term -32*(65/sqrt(41))/sqrt(41) simplifies to -32*65/41, which is -2080/41.
The equation becomes -2080/41 - 24q*sqrt(21)/sqrt(41) + 400/41 = -48.
Combining the constant terms gives (-2080 + 400)/41 = -1680/41.
The equation simplifies to -1680/41 - 24q*sqrt(21)/sqrt(41) = -48.
Multiplying both sides by 41 eliminates the denominator, resulting in -1680 - 24q*sqrt(21)*sqrt(41) = -1968.
This simplifies to -24q*sqrt(21*41) = -1968 + 1680 = -288.
Dividing by -24 yields q*sqrt(861) = 12.
Solving for q gives q = 12 / sqrt(861).
The value of sqrt(861) is sqrt(21*41).
The coordinates of point D are (65/sqrt(41), 12/sqrt(861), r).
The condition p^2 + q^2 + r^2 = 89 is used to find r.
Substituting p = 65/sqrt(41) and q = 12/sqrt(861) gives r^2 = 89 - (65/sqrt(41))^2 - (12/sqrt(861))^2.
The term (65/sqrt(41))^2 is 4225/41.
The term (12/sqrt(861))^2 is 144/861.
The value of 144/861 is approximately 0.167.
The value of 4225/41 is approximately 103.048.
The sum 4225/41 + 144/861 is approximately 103.048 + 0.167 ≈ 103.215.
The value of r^2 is approximately 89 - 103.215 ≈ -14.215, which is impossible.
The calculation is reviewed.
The value of (65/sqrt(41))^2 is 4225/41 ≈ 103.048.
The value of (12/sqrt(861))^2 is 144/861 ≈ 0.167.
The sum is approximately 103.048 + 0.167 ≈ 103.215.
Subtracting this sum from 89 results in approximately 89 - 103.215 ≈ -14.215, which is negative.
The calculation is incorrect.
The problem arises from the assumption that point D can be placed in this coordinate system with real coordinates.
This suggests an error in the coordinate assignments or calculations.

2: The coordinates of point D are calculated by solving a system of equations derived from the edge length conditions. Point D is defined by coordinates (x, y, z). The distance AD = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = sqrt(89) yields the equation x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 89. The distance BD = sqrt((x - sqrt(41))^2 + y^2 + z^2) = sqrt(80) yields the equation (x - sqrt(41))^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 80. The distance CD = sqrt((x - 16/sqrt(41))^2 + (y - 12*sqrt(21)/sqrt(41))^2 + z^2) = sqrt(41) yields the equation (x - 16/sqrt(41))^2 + (y - 12*sqrt(21)/sqrt(41))^2 + z^2 = 41. Subtracting the equation for BD from the equation for AD gives (x - sqrt(41))^2 - x^2 = 80 - 89, which simplifies to -2x*sqrt(41) + 41 = -9, leading to -2x*sqrt(41) = -50 and x = 25/sqrt(41). Subtracting the equation for CD from the equation for AD gives (x - 16/sqrt(41))^2 + (y - 12*sqrt(21)/sqrt(41))^2 - x^2 - y^2 = 41 - 89, which simplifies to -32x/sqrt(41) - 24*sqrt(21)y/sqrt(41) + 277/41 = -48.
Substituting x = 25/sqrt(41) into this equation yields -32*(25/sqrt(41))/sqrt(41) - 24*sqrt(21)y/sqrt(41) + 277/41 = -48.
This expression simplifies to -800/41 - (24*sqrt(21)/sqrt(41))y + 277/41 = -48.
Combining constants gives (-800 + 277)/41 - (24*sqrt(21)/sqrt(41))y = -48, which is -523/41 - (24*sqrt(21)/sqrt(41))y = -48.
This leads to -(24*sqrt(21)/sqrt(41))y = -48 + 523/41, which is -48 = -48*41/41 = -1968/41, so the equation becomes -(24*sqrt(21)/sqrt(41))y = (-1968 + 523)/41 = -1445/41.
Solving for y gives y = (-1445/41) / ( -24*sqrt(21)/sqrt(41)) ) = (1445/41) / (24*sqrt(21)/sqrt(41)) ) = (1445 * sqrt(41)) / (24*41*sqrt(21)).
This simplifies to 1445 / (24*41) * sqrt(41)/sqrt(21) = 1445/(984) * sqrt(41/21).
The fraction 1445/984 simplifies to 1445 ÷ 41 = 35.219512, and 984 ÷ 41 = 24. So 1445/984 = 35/24.
Thus, y = (35/24) * sqrt(41/21) = (35/24) * sqrt(41)/sqrt(21) = 35*sqrt(41)/(24*sqrt(21)).
Rationalizing the denominator gives 35*sqrt(41)*sqrt(21)/(24*21) = 35*sqrt(861)/(504).
The value of y is 35*sqrt(861)/504.
The distance from D to point A is sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = sqrt(89).
Given x = 25/sqrt(41) and y = 35*sqrt(861)/504, z^2 is calculated as 89 - x^2 - y^2.
The value of x^2 is (25/sqrt(41))^2 = 625/41 ≈ 15.2195.
The value of y^2 is (35*sqrt(861)/504)^2 = (1225*861)/254016.
The calculation of 1225*861 is performed: 1225*800 = 980,000 and 1225*61 = 74,725, so 1225*861 = 980,000 + 74,725 = 1,054,725.
The denominator is 504^2 = 254,016.
Thus, y^2 = 1,054,725 / 254,016.
This fraction simplifies by dividing numerator and denominator by 3: 351,575 / 84,672.

solve the following math problem: let $abcd$ be a tetrahedron such that $ab=cd= \sqrt{41}$, $ac=bd= \sqrt{80}$, and $bc=ad= \sqrt{89}$. there exists a point $i$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $i$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. this distance can be written in the form $\frac{m \sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. find $m+n+p$.

okay, so i have this problem about a tetrahedron abcd with specific edge lengths: ab = cd = √41, ac = bd = √80, and bc = ad = √89. there's a point i inside the tetrahedron that's equidistant from all four faces. the question is asking for the distance from this point to each face, which is given in the form m√n / p, and then to find m + n + p.
hmm, okay. let me think. first, i need to recall what kind of point in a tetrahedron is equidistant from all four faces. that sounds like the inradius of the tetrahedron, right? just like in a triangle, the inradius is the distance from the incenter to each side. so for a tetrahedron, the inradius is the distance from the incenter (the point where the angle bisectors meet?) to each face. but i'm not 100% sure about the analog in three dimensions. but given that the problem mentions such a point exists inside the tetrahedron, i'll go with that. so the problem reduces to finding the inradius of this tetrahedron.
but how do we compute the inradius of a tetrahedron? let's think. in a triangle, the inradius is equal to the area divided by the semiperimeter. is there an analogous formula for a tetrahedron? maybe the inradius is equal to the volume divided by the surface area? not exactly, because in three dimensions, the surface area is area, and the volume is volume, so the units wouldn't work out. wait, actually, for a polygon in 2d, inradius has units of length, area is length squared, and perimeter is length. so inradius = area / semiperimeter. in 3d, the inradius would have units of length, volume has units of length cubed, surface area is length squared. if we take volume / surface area, the units would be length cubed / length squared = length, which matches. so maybe the inradius is equal to the volume divided by the surface area? hmm, but is that true? let me check.
wait, actually, for a polyhedron, the volume can be expressed as the inradius multiplied by the surface area divided by 3. because each face contributes a volume of (area of face) * inradius / 3. summing over all faces gives total volume = (surface area) * inradius / 3. therefore, inradius = (3 * volume) / surface area. so yes, that makes sense. so in three dimensions, the inradius is three times the volume divided by the surface area. so to find the inradius, i need to compute the volume of the tetrahedron and the surface area (which is the sum of the areas of all four faces).
therefore, the plan is: 1. compute the areas of all four faces of the tetrahedron to get the surface area. 2. compute the volume of the tetrahedron. 3. divide 3 times the volume by the surface area to get the inradius.
alright, let's start with computing the areas of the faces. the edges given are: ab = √41, ac = √80, ad = √89 bc = √89, bd = √80, cd = √41
wait, so abcd is a tetrahedron with six edges. but the problem gives ab, ac, ad, bc, bd, cd. so those are all six edges. so we have: ab = √41, cd = √41 ac = √80, bd = √80 ad = √89, bc = √89
so the edges opposite each other are equal. that is, ab = cd, ac = bd, ad = bc. interesting. so the tetrahedron is equidimensional or something? not sure if that has a specific name. maybe a kind of disphenoid? i recall that a disphenoid is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal, and the faces are congruent. maybe that's the case here. let me check if the faces are congruent.

wait, maybe all the faces have the same area? because the tetrahedron is kind of symmetric with opposite edges equal. so if it's a disphenoid, then all four faces are congruent. let me check. if ab = cd, ac = bd, ad = bc, then indeed, the faces opposite each other are congruent. wait, abc is congruent to d-ones. let me see: face abc has edges ab, bc, ac: √41, √89, √80. face acd has edges ac, cd, ad: √80, √41, √89. so same edge lengths, so congruent. similarly, face abd has edges ab, bd, ad: √41, √80, √89. which is the same as face abc's edges. so all four faces are congruent. therefore, each face has the same area. therefore, once i compute the area of one face, i can multiply by 4 to get the total surface area.
that simplifies things. so let's compute the area of one face, say, abc. the sides are ab = √41, bc = √89, ac = √80. let me use heron's formula. first, compute the semi-perimeter: s = (ab + bc + ac)/2 = (√41 + √89 + √80)/2. then area = √[s(s - ab)(s - bc)(s - ac)].
but maybe there's a better way. maybe coordinates? since the edge lengths are given, perhaps assign coordinates to the points a, b, c, d and compute the volume and areas that way.
that might be more straightforward. let's try that approach. the idea is to place the tetrahedron in 3d space with coordinates such that the edge lengths are satisfied, then compute volume and areas via coordinates. to do this, we can fix points a, b, c, d in space with appropriate coordinates. since opposite edges are equal, maybe there's some symmetry. alternatively, start by placing point a at (0,0,0), b at some point along the x-axis, etc.
wait, in such problems, it's often useful to use coordinate systems where certain points lie along axes. let me try. let's set point a at (0,0,0). let's set point b along the x-axis, so b is at (x, 0, 0). let point c be in the xy-plane for simplicity, so c is at (a, b, 0). then point d will be somewhere in 3d space (p, q, r).
now, we need to determine coordinates such that all the given edge lengths are satisfied. let's try this step by step.
given edges: ab = √41, so since a is (0,0,0) and b is (x,0,0), ab = x = √41. so x = √41. so b is (√41, 0, 0).
next, ac = √80. since a is (0,0,0), ac = sqrt(a^2 + b^2 + 0) = sqrt(a^2 + b^2) = √80. so a2 + b2 = 80.
bc = √89. since b is (√41, 0,0) and c is (a, b, 0), bc = sqrt((a - √41)^2 + (b - 0)^2) = sqrt((a - √41)^2 + b2) = √89. therefore, (a - √41)^2 + b2 = 89.
but we already know that a2 + b2 = 80. so substituting, (a - √41)^2 + b2 = (a2 - 2a√41 + 41) + b2 = (a2 + b2) - 2a√41 + 41 = 80 - 2a√41 + 41 = 121 - 2a√41 = 89.
therefore, 121 - 2a√41 = 89 => -2a√41 = 89 - 121 = -32 => 2a√41 = 32 => a√41 = 16 => a = 16/√41.
so a = 16/√41, and since a2 + b2 = 80, then b2 = 80 - (256)/41 = (3280 - 256)/41 = 3024/41. wait, 80 = 3280/41, so 3280/41 - 256/41 = (3280 - 256)/41 = 3024/41. therefore, b = sqrt(3024/41) = sqrt(3024)/sqrt(41) = sqrt(16 * 189)/sqrt(41) = 4*sqrt(189)/sqrt(41) = 4*sqrt(189/41).
but sqrt(189) is sqrt(9*21) = 3*sqrt(21). so 4*3*sqrt(21)/sqrt(41) = 12*sqrt(21)/sqrt(41). therefore, b = 12√(21)/√41.
therefore, point c is at (16/√41, 12√21/√41, 0).
hmm, getting complicated, but okay. now, point d needs to satisfy ad = bc = √89, bd = ac = √80, and cd = ab = √41.

1: the coordinates of point d are (p, q, r). the edge length conditions are ad = √89, bd = √80, and cd = √√41. the distance ad from a(0,0,0) to d(p,q,r) is sqrt(p^2 + q^2 + r^2) = sqrt(89), which implies p^2 + q^2 + r^2 = 89. the distance bd from b(√41,0,0) to d(p,q,r) is sqrt((p - sqrt(41))^2 + q^2 + r^2) = sqrt(80), leading to (p - sqrt(41))^2 + q^2 + r^2 = 80. the distance cd from c(16/sqrt(41), 12*sqrt(21)/sqrt(41), 0) to d(p,q,r) is sqrt((p - 16/sqrt(41))^2 + (q - 12*sqrt(21)/sqrt(41))^2 + r^2) = sqrt(41), resulting in (p - 16/sqrt(41))^2 + (q - 12*sqrt(21)/sqrt(41))^2 + r^2 = 41.
subtracting the equation p^2 + q^2 + r^2 = 89 from the equation (p - sqrt(41))^2 + q^2 + r^2 = 80 yields -2p*sqrt(41) + 41 = -9, simplifying to -2p*sqrt(41) = -130, and solving gives p = 65/sqrt(41).
subtracting the equation p^2 + q^2 + r^2 = 89 from the equation (p - 16/sqrt(41))^2 + (q - 12*sqrt(21)/sqrt(41))^2 + r^2 = 41 results in the equation -32p/sqrt(41) - 24q*sqrt(21)/sqrt(41) + 400/41 = -48.
substituting p = 65/sqrt(41) into the equation -32p/sqrt(41) - 24q*sqrt(21)/sqrt(41) + 400/41 = -48 yields -32*(65/sqrt(41))/sqrt(41) - 24q*sqrt(21)/sqrt(41) + 400/41 = -48.
the term -32*(65/sqrt(41))/sqrt(41) simplifies to -32*65/41, which is -2080/41.
the equation becomes -2080/41 - 24q*sqrt(21)/sqrt(41) + 400/41 = -48.
combining the constant terms gives (-2080 + 400)/41 = -1680/41.
the equation simplifies to -1680/41 - 24q*sqrt(21)/sqrt(41) = -48.
multiplying both sides by 41 eliminates the denominator, resulting in -1680 - 24q*sqrt(21)*sqrt(41) = -1968.
this simplifies to -24q*sqrt(21*41) = -1968 + 1680 = -288.
dividing by -24 yields q*sqrt(861) = 12.
solving for q gives q = 12 / sqrt(861).
the value of sqrt(861) is sqrt(21*41).
the coordinates of point d are (65/sqrt(41), 12/sqrt(861), r).
the condition p^2 + q^2 + r^2 = 89 is used to find r.
substituting p = 65/sqrt(41) and q = 12/sqrt(861) gives r^2 = 89 - (65/sqrt(41))^2 - (12/sqrt(861))^2.
the term (65/sqrt(41))^2 is 4225/41.
the term (12/sqrt(861))^2 is 144/861.
the value of 144/861 is approximately 0.167.
the value of 4225/41 is approximately 103.048.
the sum 4225/41 + 144/861 is approximately 103.048 + 0.167 ≈ 103.215.
the value of r^2 is approximately 89 - 103.215 ≈ -14.215, which is impossible.
the calculation is reviewed.
the value of (65/sqrt(41))^2 is 4225/41 ≈ 103.048.
the value of (12/sqrt(861))^2 is 144/861 ≈ 0.167.
the sum is approximately 103.048 + 0.167 ≈ 103.215.
subtracting this sum from 89 results in approximately 89 - 103.215 ≈ -14.215, which is negative.
the calculation is incorrect.
the problem arises from the assumption that point d can be placed in this coordinate system with real coordinates.
this suggests an error in the coordinate assignments or calculations.
the coordinate assignments for points a, b, c, d are re-evaluated.

2: the coordinates of point d are calculated by solving a system of equations derived from the edge length conditions. point d is defined by coordinates (x, y, z). the distance ad = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = sqrt(89) yields the equation x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 89. the distance bd = sqrt((x - sqrt(41))^2 + y^2 + z^2) = sqrt(80) yields the equation (x - sqrt(41))^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 80. the distance cd = sqrt((x - 16/sqrt(41))^2 + (y - 12*sqrt(21)/sqrt(41))^2 + z^2) = sqrt(41) yields the equation (x - 16/sqrt(41))^2 + (y - 12*sqrt(21)/sqrt(41))^2 + z^2 = 41. subtracting the equation for bd from the equation for ad gives (x - sqrt(41))^2 - x^2 = 80 - 89, which simplifies to -2x*sqrt(41) + 41 = -9, leading to -2x*sqrt(41) = -50 and x = 25/sqrt(41). subtracting the equation for cd from the equation for ad gives (x - 16/sqrt(41))^2 + (y - 12*sqrt(21)/sqrt(41))^2 - x^2 - y^2 = 41 - 89, which simplifies to -32x/sqrt(41) - 24*sqrt(21)y/sqrt(41) + 277/41 = -48.
substituting x = 25/sqrt(41) into this equation yields -32*(25/sqrt(41))/sqrt(41) - 24*sqrt(21)y/sqrt(41) + 277/41 = -48.
this expression simplifies to -800/41 - (24*sqrt(21)/sqrt(41))y + 277/41 = -48.
combining constants gives (-800 + 277)/41 - (24*sqrt(21)/sqrt(41))y = -48, which is -523/41 - (24*sqrt(21)/sqrt(41))y = -48.
this leads to -(24*sqrt(21)/sqrt(41))y = -48 + 523/41, which is -48 = -48*41/41 = -1968/41, so the equation becomes -(24*sqrt(21)/sqrt(41))y = (-1968 + 523)/41 = -1445/41.
solving for y gives y = (-1445/41) / ( -24*sqrt(21)/sqrt(41)) ) = (1445/41) / (24*sqrt(21)/sqrt(41)) ) = (1445 * sqrt(41)) / (24*41*sqrt(21)).
this simplifies to 1445 / (24*41) * sqrt(41)/sqrt(21) = 1445/(984) * sqrt(41/21).
the fraction 1445/984 simplifies to 1445 ÷ 41 = 35.219512, and 984 ÷ 41 = 24. so 1445/984 = 35/24.
thus, y = (35/24) * sqrt(41/21) = (35/24) * sqrt(41)/sqrt(21) = 35*sqrt(41)/(24*sqrt(21)).
rationalizing the denominator gives 35*sqrt(41)*sqrt(21)/(24*21) = 35*sqrt(861)/(504).
the value of y is 35*sqrt(861)/504.
the distance from d to point a is sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = sqrt(89).
given x = 25/sqrt(41) and y = 35*sqrt(861)/504, z^2 is calculated as 89 - x^2 - y^2.
the value of x^2 is (25/sqrt(41))^2 = 625/41 ≈ 15.2195.
the value of y^2 is (35*sqrt(861)/504)^2 = (1225*861)/254016.
the calculation of 1225*861 is performed: 1225*800 = 980,000 and 1225*61 = 74,725, so 1225*861 = 980,000 + 74,725 = 1,054,725.
the denominator is 504^2 = 254,016.
thus, y^2 = 1,054,725 / 254,016.
