Okay, so I need to solve this math problem about a list of positive integers with specific properties. Let me read through the problem again and make sure I understand all the requirements.
The list has three key properties:
1. The sum of all the numbers in the list is 30.
2. The unique mode of the list is 9. That means 9 appears more often than any other number in the list, and there are no other numbers that appear the same number of times as 9.
3. The median of the list is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list itself.
I need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.
Since the problem mentions the mode is unique, that tells me that 9 has the highest frequency, and no other number has the same frequency. So, if 9 appears, say, 'm' times, then every other number appears fewer than 'm' times, and all other numbers have different frequencies or appear only once?
Wait, maybe not necessarily different frequencies, but the highest frequency is unique to 9.
The median is a positive integer not in the list, so the median must be a number that isn't present in the list.
Let me recall that the median is the middle number when the list is sorted.
If the number of elements is odd, the median is the middle element; if even, it's the average of the two middle elements.
But the problem states the median is a positive integer, which implies that even if there are two middle numbers, their average must be an integer.
However, since the median is required to be a positive integer that does not appear in the list, if the number of elements is even, the two middle numbers must be the same (so their average is an integer), but that integer then is part of the list, which would contradict the condition that the median doesn't appear in the list.
Wait, but the problem says "the median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself."
So if the number of elements is even, the median would be the average of the two middle numbers.
For that average to be a positive integer not in the list, the two middle numbers must either be equal (so their average is themselves, but then the median would be that number, which is in the list), which would violate the condition, or they must be two different numbers whose average is an integer not in the list.
Alternatively, if the number of elements is odd, the median is the middle number, which would be in the list, so that can't satisfy the condition.
Therefore, the list must have an even number of elements.
Let me confirm this reasoning.
Suppose the list has an odd number of elements.
Then the median is the middle element, which is part of the list, so that can't satisfy the condition that the median is not in the list.
Therefore, the number of elements must be even.
So the list has an even number of elements, say 'n' is even.
Then the median is the average of the (n/2)th and (n/2 +1)th elements when sorted.
For that average to be a positive integer, those two numbers must either be consecutive integers (their average would not be an integer) or the same number.
Wait, if they are the same number, then their average is that number, which is in the list, which violates the condition.
If they are different numbers, say 'a' and 'b', then their average is (a + b)/2.
For this to be an integer, (a + b) must be even, so a and b must both be even or both be odd.
But even then, the median (which is that integer) must not appear in the list.
But if a and b are numbers in the list, then their average could be equal to one of them, but then that would mean a = b, but if a and b are different, then the average would not be equal to a or b.
Wait, maybe not.
Let me think.
Wait, if the two middle numbers are different, their average would only be an integer if they are both even or both odd (so that their sum is even, divisible by 2).
But even so, that integer would be a number not present in the list.
But if the list contains numbers a and b, then the median (a + b)/2 is not in the list.
However, if a and b are both in the list, and their average is an integer, which is the median, and that integer is not in the list.
So that seems possible.
For example, if the two middle numbers are 8 and 10, their average is 9.
If 9 is not in the list, then the median would be 9, which is a positive integer not in the list.
But in that case, 9 is the mode, so 9 has to appear more frequently than any other number.
Wait, but in this example, 9 is not in the list, but the mode is 9.
Wait, contradiction here.
If the mode is 9, then 9 must appear in the list.
Wait, but the problem says the unique mode of the list is 9, so 9 must be present in the list, and it appears more often than any other number.
But then, if 9 is in the list, how can the median, which is a number not in the list, be 9?
Wait, but the median could be another number.
Wait, no, in the example above, if two middle numbers average to 9, then the median is 9, but 9 is in the list because the mode is 9.
So that can't be.
So perhaps my initial thought is conflicting.
Let me re-examine.
The problem says the unique mode is 9, so 9 must be present in the list, and it must appear more frequently than any other number.
The median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list.
So the median is some integer, say 'k', not in the list, and since the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.
Therefore, the two middle numbers must add up to 2k, so (a + b)/2 = k, where a and b are the two middle numbers, and k is not in the list.
Also, since the list is made of positive integers, all numbers in the list are at least 1.
But 9 is the mode, so to make 9 the unique mode, we need to have 9 appearing more times than any other number.
Let me think about constructing such a list.
Let's suppose the list has n elements, n is even.
Let me start by supposing a small number of elements.
Wait, but the sum is 30.
Let's see, the sum of the numbers is 30.
Since all numbers are positive integers, the minimum possible number of elements is 30 (all 1s), but since the mode is unique and 9, there must be at least one 9, and 9s must be more frequent than any other number.
So the number of elements can't be too small.
For example, if the list has only two elements, sum 30, but mode is 9, which would require both elements to be 9, but then sum is 18, which is not 30.
So that's impossible.
Similarly, four elements: maybe two 9s and two other numbers summing to 30 - 18 = 12.
Let's say two 6s.
Then the list would be 6,6,9,9.
The sum is 30.
The mode would be 6 and 9, which would be bimodal, but the problem says the unique mode is 9.
So that's no good.
So the frequency of 9 must be higher than any other number.
So perhaps, if we have three 9s.
Let's try that.
Three 9s sum to 27.
Then the remaining sum is 3.
So we need three other numbers (since three 9s already), but three numbers summing to 3.
The only positive integers that sum to 3 are three 1s.
So the list would be 1,1,1,9,9,9.
But wait, sum is 1+1+1+9+9+9=30?
Wait, 3+27=30?
No, 3+27=30, that's correct.
Wait, but the number of elements here is 6.
Let me check the properties:
1. Sum is 30: yes.
2. Unique mode is 9: in the list [1,1,1,9,9,9], the numbers 1 and 9 both appear three times, so it's bimodal.
That's not acceptable, as the problem states the unique mode is 9.
So we have a problem here.
So to have 9 as the unique mode, it must appear more times than any other number.
So perhaps four 9s?
Let's see.
Four 9s sum to 36, which is already more than 30.
So that's too much.
Therefore, three 9s is 27, and the rest need to sum to 3.
But using three 1s leads to a bimodal list.
So how can we have the mode be 9 with three 9s?
If we have three 9s, and the other numbers appearing less than three times.
For example, two 1s and one 1, but that's still three 1s.
Wait, same problem.
Alternatively, different numbers.
For example, 2,1,0, but numbers must be positive integers.
So minimum is 1.
So if we have numbers summing to 3, the only possibility is three 1s, which gives the bimodal list.
So that's not allowed.
Therefore, perhaps we need another approach.
Let's think: since the mode is 9, which must appear more times than any other number.
Let me denote the number of 9s as 'm'.
To have 9 as the unique mode, m must be greater than the count of any other number in the list.
Let me also note that the sum of the numbers in the list is 30, so if there are k numbers which are 9, then the remaining numbers sum to 30 - 9k.
These remaining numbers must be positive integers, different from 9, and their frequencies must all be less than m.
Also, the median needs to be an integer not in the list.
Let me recall that the median is either a number in the list (if odd) or the average of two numbers in the list (if even).
Since the median here is required to be a positive integer not in the list, the list must have an even number of elements, so the median is the average of the two middle numbers, which must be integers.
Let's suppose the list has 2n elements.
Then the median is the average of the nth and (n+1)th numbers when sorted in order.
For the median to be an integer, those two numbers must either be both even or both odd, such that their average is an integer.
However, since the median must not be in the list, those two middle numbers can't both be the same, because otherwise their average would be that number, which is in the list.
Therefore, the two middle numbers must be different, and their average must not be present in the list.
Let's think in parallel.

1: Suppose the list has six elements (n=3).
Then the median is the average of the 3rd and 4th elements.
Let me try to construct such a list.
Suppose the list has two 9s.
Wait, but if we need the mode to be 9, appearing more frequently than any other number.
If there are two 9s, then we need to ensure no other number appears twice, and 9 appears more frequently.
Wait, two 9s: but then other numbers can appear at most once.
But if we have two 9s, sum is 18, remaining sum is 12.
If the other four numbers (since total six elements) must sum to 12 and each can appear at most once (to ensure 9's frequency of 2 is the unique mode), but if they are all distinct, then the numbers would be, for example, 1,2,3,4 which sum to 10, but need sum to 12.
Alternatively, 2,3,4,3: but then 3 is repeated, leading to mode conflict.
Wait, this is getting complicated.
</Path>
<Path>
2: Alternatively, let's try four numbers.
Wait, if there are four numbers, each 9, but 4*9=36, which exceeds 30.
So that's too big.
What if the list has five elements?
Wait, five is odd, so the median would be the third number, which is in the list.
But the problem says the median is not in the list.
So five elements is invalid.
Let's try n=6 elements.
Let me try to construct a list with six elements where the sum is 30, mode is 9, and the median is an integer not in the list.
Suppose we have two 9s.
Then the sum of the other four numbers is 30 - 18 = 12.
Let's see.
But if we have two 9s, then other numbers can appear at most once to have 9 as the unique mode.
Wait, but if we have two 9s, then to have 9 as the unique mode, all other numbers must appear once or twice, but no number can appear three times or more.
Wait, but with six elements, if we have two 9s, then the other four numbers can be arranged.
But if we have two 9s, then to have 9 as the unique mode, two is the maximum frequency.
So other numbers must appear once or twice.
But since the total elements are six, and two are 9s, the remaining four numbers must be arranged such that no number appears more than once.
Wait, but four numbers could be two pairs, so two numbers each appearing twice.
Then the list would have two 9s, and two pairs.
But then the mode isn't unique, since there would be multiple modes with frequency two.
Therefore, to have the unique mode as 9, the 9s must appear more times than anything else.
So if we have two 9s, then other numbers can't appear twice.
Therefore, the other four numbers must all be distinct.
Let's see.
So two 9s, sum of the rest is 12.
If the other four numbers are distinct and positive integers, the smallest four distinct numbers are 1,2,3,4, which sum to 10.
So to get 12, maybe 1,2,3,6.
So 1+2+3+6=12.
Then the list would be [1,2,3,6,9,9].
Let's check the properties.
Sum: 1+2+3+6+9+9=30.
The mode is 9, which appears twice.
Are there other modes?
No, all others appear once.
So unique mode is 9.
The number of elements is 6, which is even.
The median would be the average of the third and fourth numbers.
Sorted list: [1,2,3,6,9,9].
Third number is 3, fourth is 6.
Their average is (3+6)/2=4.5, which is not an integer.
So that doesn't satisfy the condition that the median is a positive integer.
So this list is invalid.
Alternatively, perhaps the other four numbers can be 1,1,3,7.
Wait, sum is 1+1+3+7=12.
Then the list would be 1,1,3,7,9,9.
Sum is 30.
The mode would be 1 and 9, both appearing twice, which violates the unique mode.
So that's bad.
Alternatively, to avoid that, maybe use different numbers.
Wait, but if we have two 9s, and need the remaining four numbers to sum to 12, with each appearing once.
Then the four numbers need to be distinct.
The minimal sum of four distinct numbers is 1+2+3+4=10.
So to get 12, we can replace 4 with 5, so 1+2+3+6=12, or other combinations like 1+2+4+5=12.
Let's take 1,2,4,5.
Then the list would be 1,2,4,5,9,9.
Sorted list: 1,2,4,5,9,9.
Median is (4+5)/2=4.5, not an integer.
Not valid.
Alternatively, if the remaining four numbers are 2,3,3,4.
Wait, but then numbers 3 and 9 would both appear twice?
No, 3 appears twice, but 9 is two.
So that's bimodal.
Alternatively, maybe three 9s.
Wait, three 9s sum to 27, so remaining three numbers sum to 3.
The only possibility is three 1s, which gives a bimodal list.
As before.
So again, that's invalid.
Wait, maybe three 9s and then other numbers.
But 9 appears three times, and others must appear less than three times.
Let's see.
Let's suppose three 9s, sum 27.
The remaining three numbers sum to 3.
The only possible combination is three 1s.
Which makes the list bimodal.
So that's bad.
Alternatively, two 1s and a single 1?
Wait, sum would be 1+1+1=3, but that's three 1s again.
So unavoidable bimodal list here.
Therefore, perhaps three 9s is not可行.
What about four 9s?
Four 9s sum to 36, which is over 30.
So that's impossible.
So the only other option is one 9.
Wait, but then the mode is unique as 9.
But if there's only one 9, how can that be the unique mode?
Unless other numbers appear less than once, but that's not possible.
Wait, no.
If 9 appears once, then other numbers must appear fewer than once, which is impossible.
So the mode must be at least two.
Wait, but earlier reasoning showed that if the mode is 9, which is supposed to be the unique mode, then if we have two 9s, other numbers can be present but must not have frequency more than one.
But in that case, the list would have two 9s and four other distinct numbers (sum 6 elements total).
However, as above, the median would be the average of third and fourth numbers, which might not be an integer.
Alternatively, maybe a list with eight elements.
Let's think bigger.
Let's suppose eight elements.
If the list has eight elements, sum is 30.
The mode is 9, so 9 appears more than any other number.
Let's say two 9s.
Then the remaining six numbers must sum to 30 - 18 = 12.
To have 9 as the unique mode, all other numbers must appear once.
If six distinct numbers, each appearing once, summing to 12.
The smallest six distinct positive integers are 1,2,3,4,5,6, which sum to 21.
That's too much.
So we need six distinct numbers summing to 12.
That's impossible, because 1+2+3+4+5+6=21, which is way over.
Alternatively, maybe repeating numbers.
But if we repeat numbers, then their frequency increases.
For example, using three 1s, but then 1 would appear three times, which is more than some other numbers.
But if 9 appears only twice, then 1 could appear three times, which would make the mode 1, unless 9 appears more frequently.
So contradiction.
Therefore, if we have two 9s, to avoid other numbers having frequency two, we need all other numbers to appear once.
But since their sum needs to be 12 with at least six numbers, which is not possible.
So this approach isn't可行.
Alternatively, maybe three 9s.
Sum 27.
Remaining three numbers sum to 3.
Three numbers: three 1s.
But that's a bimodal list.
Alternatively, two 1s and one 1?
No, same thing.
So again, bimodal.
Alternatively, is there a way to have three 9s and other numbers with different frequencies?
For example, three 9s, one 3, and six 0s, but numbers must be positive integers.
So no zeros.
Hmm.
Alternatively, three 9s, sum 27.
Then need three numbers summing to 3.
The only way is three 1s, which leads to bimodal list.
So seems like this is impossible.
Wait, unless there is a list where 9 appears twice, but other numbers appear only once, but their sum is 12 with six numbers.
Wait, but as we saw, with six distinct numbers starting from 1, sum is 1+2+3+4+5+6=21, which is too high.
So maybe not distinct, but numbers can repeat.
But if numbers repeat, then their frequency increases, which could challenge the mode.
For example, suppose two 9s, and six numbers which include two 2s, two 3s, and two 4s.
Then sum would be 2*2 + 2*3 + 2*4 = 20.
But we need sum to be 12.
Alternatively, this is not possible.
Wait, perhaps this approach is not feasible.
Let me think again.
Maybe the list has ten elements.
Let's see.
Ten elements, sum is 30.
The mode is 9.
So 9 appears more times than any other number.
Let's say two 9s.
Then the remaining eight numbers must sum to 30 - 18 = 12.
Again, having eight positive integers summing to 12.
The minimal sum is 8 (eight 1s), so we need to distribute 12 -8=4 more among them.
But if we have eight numbers, each at least 1, with sum 12.
So possible combinations: seven 1s and one 5, or six 1s and two 3s, etc.
Let's see.
For example, two 3s and six 1s.
Then the list would be 3,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,9,9.
Sorted list: 1,1,1,1,1,1,3,3,9,9.
Median is average of 5th and 6th elements, both 1, so average is 1, which is in the list.
So that doesn't satisfy the condition.
Alternatively, one 6 and nine 1s?
Wait, no, sum would be 15.
Wait, need sum 12.
Let me correct.
If we have eight numbers summing to 12.
Possible distribution could be eight 1s and 4, sum is 12.
So the list would be 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,9,9.
Wait, nine elements?
Wait, no.
Wait, ten elements: eight 1s, one 4, and one 9.
But sum is 8*1 +4 +9=21, which is less than 30.
So need more numbers.
Wait, total numbers would be ten.
So eight numbers summing to 12: for example, seven 1s, one 5.
Sum:7+5=12.
Then the list is seven 1s, one 5, two 9s.
Total ten elements.
Sum is 7*1 +5 +18=30.
The mode here is 1, appearing seven times, which contradicts the unique mode being 9.
So invalid.
Alternatively, six 1s, two 3s.
Sum 6*1 +6=12.
List is six 1s, two 3s, two 9s.
Total ten elements.
Sum is 6 +6 +18=30.
But mode is 1, appearing six times.
Again contradicts.
Alternatively, five 1s, one 7.
Sum 5 +7=12.
List is five 1s, one 7, two 9s.
Total eight elements.
Wait, no.
Need eight numbers summing to 12.
So sorted list would be 1,1,1,1,1,7,9,9.
But sum is 5 +7 +18=30.
Number of elements is eight.
Wait, but earlier thought was ten elements.
Wait, conflicting.
Wait, original assumption was ten elements: if two 9s, sum of the remaining eight numbers is 12.
For example, five 1s, one 7, two 0s, but numbers must be positive.
So two 1s instead.
Wait, not sure.
Let me re-examine.
Wait, if the list has ten elements, two of them are 9s, contributing 18.
The remaining eight elements must sum to 12.
These eight elements must be positive integers.
The minimal sum for eight positive integers is 8 (all 1s).
So to get a sum of 12, we need an additional 4.
So we can distribute these 4 over the eight elements.
For example, one possible way is four 2s and four 1s.
Sum:4*2 +4*1=8+4=12.
Then the list would be four 2s, four 1s, and two 9s.
Total ten elements.
Sum is 4*2 +4*1 +2*9=8+4+18=30.
The mode would be both 1 and 2, appearing four times each, which contradicts the unique mode 9.
So invalid.
Alternatively, three 2s, five 1s.
Sum:3*2 +5*1=6+5=11.
Not 12.
Add one more to make 12.
Maybe three 2s, four 1s, and one 3.
Sum:3*2 +4*1 +1*3=6+4+3=13.
Not 12.
Alternatively, two 3s, six 1s.
Sum:2*3 +6*1=6+6=12.
Then the list is two 3s, six 1s, two 9s.
Total ten elements.
Sum:6+6+18=30.
But mode is 1, appearing six times.
Contradicts unique mode 9.
So still bad.
Another distribution: one 4, seven 1s.
Sum:4 +7=11.
Add one more.
One 4, six 1s, one 2.
Sum:4+6+2=12.
So list is one 4, six 1s, one 2, two 9s.
Total ten elements.
Sorted list:1,1,1,1,1,1,2,4,9,9.
Sum:6+2+4+18=30.
Mode is 1, appearing six times.
So invalid.
Alternatively, another distribution: two 2s, two 3s, four 1s.
Sum:2*2 +2*3 +4*1=4+6+4=14.
Not 12.
Hmm.
This is getting complicated.
Maybe the list needs to have a different number of elements.
Let's try seven elements.
Wait, seven is odd, so the median is the fourth element, which is in the list, which is invalid.
So seven is out.
Let's try eight elements.
Eight elements, sum 30, mode 9, median is integer not in list.
Let's see.
Suppose two 9s.
Then remaining six elements sum to 12.
Possible distributions: six 1s (sum 6), need additional 6.
Maybe three 3s and three 1s.
Sum:3*3 +3*1=9+3=12.
List would be three 3s, three 1s, two 9s.
Total eight elements.
Sum:9+3+18=30.
But the mode would be 1 and 3, each appearing three times.
So bimodal.
Invalid.
Alternatively, two 4s, two 2s, two 1s.
Sum:2*4 +2*2 +2*1=8+4+2=14.
Not 12.
Another distribution: one 6, four 1s, one 2.
Sum:6+4+2=12.
List is one 6, four 1s, one 2, two 9s.
Total eight elements.
Sum:6+4+2+18=30.
Mode is 1, appearing four times.
Invalid.
Alternatively, one 5, one 7.
Wait, sum 5+7=12.
List is one 5, one 7, two 9s, and six elements?
Wait, total eight elements.
So remaining six elements need to sum to 0.
No, impossible.
Wait, maybe I need to have three 9s.
Three 9s sum 27.
Remaining five elements must sum to 3.
Only possible if five 1s.
So list is five 1s, three 9s.
Total eight elements.
Sum:5+27=32.
Which is over 30.
So invalid.
Alternatively, three 9s (27).
Then remaining five elements sum to 3.
If four 1s and one 0, but 0 is not allowed.
So impossible.
So perhaps nine elements.
Let's see.
Wait, nine is odd.
Median is the fifth element.
Which must be in the list, so invalid.
So nine is out.
Another angle: Let's think about the median.
Since the list must have an even number of elements, let's suppose four elements.
The minimal even number.
But four elements sum to 30.
If two 9s, sum 18, remaining two elements sum 12.
For example, 6 and 6.
Then list is 6,6,9,9.
Sum 30.
The mode is 6 and 9, which is bimodal.
Invalid.
If two 9s, and two other different numbers: 5 and 7.
List:5,7,9,9.
Sum 5+7+18=30.
But the mode is still 9, appearing twice.
Other numbers appear once.
So unique mode is 9.
Then the median is (7+9)/2=8.
Which is not in the list, as 8 is not one of the numbers.
Therefore, does this work?
Wait, let's check all conditions.
1. Sum of the items is 30: 5 +7 +9 +9 = 30.
Yes.
2. Unique mode is 9: 9 appears twice, which is more than any other number.
Correct.
3. Median is a positive integer not in the list.
The sorted list is [5,7,9,9].
Median is (7 +9)/2=8, which is not in the list.
Perfect.
So this list satisfies all conditions.
Let me verify again.
Sum:5 +7 +9 +9=30.
Yes.
Mode:9 is the unique mode because it appears twice, which is more than 5 or 7, which each appear once.
Median:8, which is not in the list.
So all conditions are satisfied.
Therefore, this must be the list.
So the numbers are 5,7,9,9.
Now, the problem asks for the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.
So compute 52 +72 +92 +92.
Let's calculate:
52=25
72=49
92=81
So 25 +49 +81 +81=25+49=74, 74+81=155, 155+81=236.
Let me confirm: 25+49=74, 74+81=155, 155+81=236.
Wait, but if the list is 5,7,9,9, then sum of squares is 52+72+92+92=25+49+81+81=236.
Therefore, the answer is 236.
Wait, but earlier when I tried two 9s and two other numbers summing to 12, I considered 6 and 6, but that led to bimodal list.
But with 5 and 7, which both appear once, so unique mode is 9.
So that works.
So why didn't I think of this earlier.
Median is 8, which is not in the list, perfect.
So this list meets all criteria.
Hence, the answer should be 236.
**Final Answer** 
\boxed{236}
</Think>

Answer: To solve the problem, we need to find a list of positive integers that meets the following conditions:
1. The sum of the items in the list is 30.
2. The unique mode of the list is 9.
3. The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.

We start by considering the properties of the list:
- The mode is 9, which must appear more frequently than any other number.
- The list must have an even number of elements for the median to be an integer not in the list (average of the two middle numbers).

After several trials and considerations, we find that a list with four elements: 5, 7, 9, 9 satisfies all conditions:
1. Sum: \(5 + 7 + 9 + 9 = 30\).
2. Unique mode: 9 appears twice, more than any other number.
3. Median: The average of the two middle numbers (7 and 9) is 8, which is not in the list.

Next, we calculate the sum of the squares of all the items in the list:
\[
5^2 + 7^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236
\]

Thus, the sum of the squares of all the items in the list is \(\boxed{236}\).<Conclusion>

<think>
okay, so i need to solve this math problem about a list of positive integers with specific properties. let me read through the problem again and make sure i understand all the requirements.
the list has three key properties:
1. the sum of all the numbers in the list is 30.
2. the unique mode of the list is 9. that means 9 appears more often than any other number in the list, and there are no other numbers that appear the same number of times as 9.
3. the median of the list is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list itself.
i need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.
since the problem mentions the mode is unique, that tells me that 9 has the highest frequency, and no other number has the same frequency. so, if 9 appears, say, 'm' times, then every other number appears fewer than 'm' times, and all other numbers have different frequencies or appear only once?
wait, maybe not necessarily different frequencies, but the highest frequency is unique to 9.
the median is a positive integer not in the list, so the median must be a number that isn't present in the list.
let me recall that the median is the middle number when the list is sorted.
if the number of elements is odd, the median is the middle element; if even, it's the average of the two middle elements.
but the problem states the median is a positive integer, which implies that even if there are two middle numbers, their average must be an integer.
however, since the median is required to be a positive integer that does not appear in the list, if the number of elements is even, the two middle numbers must be the same (so their average is an integer), but that integer then is part of the list, which would contradict the condition that the median doesn't appear in the list.
wait, but the problem says "the median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself."
so if the number of elements is even, the median would be the average of the two middle numbers.
for that average to be a positive integer not in the list, the two middle numbers must either be equal (so their average is themselves, but then the median would be that number, which is in the list), which would violate the condition, or they must be two different numbers whose average is an integer not in the list.
alternatively, if the number of elements is odd, the median is the middle number, which would be in the list, so that can't satisfy the condition.
therefore, the list must have an even number of elements.
let me confirm this reasoning.
suppose the list has an odd number of elements.
then the median is the middle element, which is part of the list, so that can't satisfy the condition that the median is not in the list.
therefore, the number of elements must be even.
so the list has an even number of elements, say 'n' is even.
then the median is the average of the (n/2)th and (n/2 +1)th elements when sorted.
for that average to be a positive integer, those two numbers must either be consecutive integers (their average would not be an integer) or the same number.
wait, if they are the same number, then their average is that number, which is in the list, which violates the condition.
if they are different numbers, say 'a' and 'b', then their average is (a + b)/2.
for this to be an integer, (a + b) must be even, so a and b must both be even or both be odd.
but even then, the median (which is that integer) must not appear in the list.
but if a and b are numbers in the list, then their average could be equal to one of them, but then that would mean a = b, but if a and b are different, then the average would not be equal to a or b.
wait, maybe not.
let me think.
wait, if the two middle numbers are different, their average would only be an integer if they are both even or both odd (so that their sum is even, divisible by 2).
but even so, that integer would be a number not present in the list.
but if the list contains numbers a and b, then the median (a + b)/2 is not in the list.
however, if a and b are both in the list, and their average is an integer, which is the median, and that integer is not in the list.
so that seems possible.
for example, if the two middle numbers are 8 and 10, their average is 9.
if 9 is not in the list, then the median would be 9, which is a positive integer not in the list.
but in that case, 9 is the mode, so 9 has to appear more frequently than any other number.
wait, but in this example, 9 is not in the list, but the mode is 9.
wait, contradiction here.
if the mode is 9, then 9 must appear in the list.
wait, but the problem says the unique mode of the list is 9, so 9 must be present in the list, and it appears more often than any other number.
but then, if 9 is in the list, how can the median, which is a number not in the list, be 9?
wait, but the median could be another number.
wait, no, in the example above, if two middle numbers average to 9, then the median is 9, but 9 is in the list because the mode is 9.
so that can't be.
so perhaps my initial thought is conflicting.
let me re-examine.
the problem says the unique mode is 9, so 9 must be present in the list, and it must appear more frequently than any other number.
the median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list.
so the median is some integer, say 'k', not in the list, and since the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.
therefore, the two middle numbers must add up to 2k, so (a + b)/2 = k, where a and b are the two middle numbers, and k is not in the list.
also, since the list is made of positive integers, all numbers in the list are at least 1.
but 9 is the mode, so to make 9 the unique mode, we need to have 9 appearing more times than any other number.
let me think about constructing such a list.
let's suppose the list has n elements, n is even.
let me start by supposing a small number of elements.
wait, but the sum is 30.
let's see, the sum of the numbers is 30.
since all numbers are positive integers, the minimum possible number of elements is 30 (all 1s), but since the mode is unique and 9, there must be at least one 9, and 9s must be more frequent than any other number.
so the number of elements can't be too small.
for example, if the list has only two elements, sum 30, but mode is 9, which would require both elements to be 9, but then sum is 18, which is not 30.
so that's impossible.
similarly, four elements: maybe two 9s and two other numbers summing to 30 - 18 = 12.
let's say two 6s.
then the list would be 6,6,9,9.
the sum is 30.
the mode would be 6 and 9, which would be bimodal, but the problem says the unique mode is 9.
so that's no good.
so the frequency of 9 must be higher than any other number.
so perhaps, if we have three 9s.
let's try that.
three 9s sum to 27.
then the remaining sum is 3.
so we need three other numbers (since three 9s already), but three numbers summing to 3.
the only positive integers that sum to 3 are three 1s.
so the list would be 1,1,1,9,9,9.
but wait, sum is 1+1+1+9+9+9=30?
wait, 3+27=30?
no, 3+27=30, that's correct.
wait, but the number of elements here is 6.
let me check the properties:
1. sum is 30: yes.
2. unique mode is 9: in the list [1,1,1,9,9,9], the numbers 1 and 9 both appear three times, so it's bimodal.
that's not acceptable, as the problem states the unique mode is 9.
so we have a problem here.
so to have 9 as the unique mode, it must appear more times than any other number.
so perhaps four 9s?
let's see.
four 9s sum to 36, which is already more than 30.
so that's too much.
therefore, three 9s is 27, and the rest need to sum to 3.
but using three 1s leads to a bimodal list.
so how can we have the mode be 9 with three 9s?
if we have three 9s, and the other numbers appearing less than three times.
for example, two 1s and one 1, but that's still three 1s.
wait, same problem.
alternatively, different numbers.
for example, 2,1,0, but numbers must be positive integers.
so minimum is 1.
so if we have numbers summing to 3, the only possibility is three 1s, which gives the bimodal list.
so that's not allowed.
therefore, perhaps we need another approach.
let's think: since the mode is 9, which must appear more times than any other number.
let me denote the number of 9s as 'm'.
to have 9 as the unique mode, m must be greater than the count of any other number in the list.
let me also note that the sum of the numbers in the list is 30, so if there are k numbers which are 9, then the remaining numbers sum to 30 - 9k.
these remaining numbers must be positive integers, different from 9, and their frequencies must all be less than m.
also, the median needs to be an integer not in the list.
let me recall that the median is either a number in the list (if odd) or the average of two numbers in the list (if even).
since the median here is required to be a positive integer not in the list, the list must have an even number of elements, so the median is the average of the two middle numbers, which must be integers.
let's suppose the list has 2n elements.
then the median is the average of the nth and (n+1)th numbers when sorted in order.
for the median to be an integer, those two numbers must either be both even or both odd, such that their average is an integer.
however, since the median must not be in the list, those two middle numbers can't both be the same, because otherwise their average would be that number, which is in the list.
therefore, the two middle numbers must be different, and their average must not be present in the list.
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>
<goal>
<outline>
1: explore a list structure with two 9s and other numbers summing to 12, considering the mode requirement.
</outline>
<outline>
2: explore a list structure with three 9s and other numbers summing to 3, considering the mode requirement.
</outline>
</goal>
<path>
1: suppose the list has six elements (n=3).
then the median is the average of the 3rd and 4th elements.
let me try to construct such a list.
suppose the list has two 9s.
wait, but if we need the mode to be 9, appearing more frequently than any other number.
if there are two 9s, then we need to ensure no other number appears twice, and 9 appears more frequently.
wait, two 9s: but then other numbers can appear at most once.
but if we have two 9s, sum is 18, remaining sum is 12.
if the other four numbers (since total six elements) must sum to 12 and each can appear at most once (to ensure 9's frequency of 2 is the unique mode), but if they are all distinct, then the numbers would be, for example, 1,2,3,4 which sum to 10, but need sum to 12.
alternatively, 2,3,4,3: but then 3 is repeated, leading to mode conflict.
wait, this is getting complicated.
</path>
<path>
2: alternatively, let's try four numbers.
wait, if there are four numbers, each 9, but 4*9=36, which exceeds 30.
so that's too big.
what if the list has five elements?
wait, five is odd, so the median would be the third number, which is in the list.
but the problem says the median is not in the list.
so five elements is invalid.
let's try n=6 elements.
let me try to construct a list with six elements where the sum is 30, mode is 9, and the median is an integer not in the list.
suppose we have two 9s.
then the sum of the other four numbers is 30 - 18 = 12.
let's see.
but if we have two 9s, then other numbers can appear at most once to have 9 as the unique mode.
wait, but if we have two 9s, then to have 9 as the unique mode, all other numbers must appear once or twice, but no number can appear three times or more.
wait, but with six elements, if we have two 9s, then the other four numbers can be arranged.
but if we have two 9s, then to have 9 as the unique mode, two is the maximum frequency.
so other numbers must appear once or twice.
but since the total elements are six, and two are 9s, the remaining four numbers must be arranged such that no number appears more than once.
wait, but four numbers could be two pairs, so two numbers each appearing twice.
then the list would have two 9s, and two pairs.
but then the mode isn't unique, since there would be multiple modes with frequency two.
therefore, to have the unique mode as 9, the 9s must appear more times than anything else.
so if we have two 9s, then other numbers can't appear twice.
therefore, the other four numbers must all be distinct.
let's see.
so two 9s, sum of the rest is 12.
if the other four numbers are distinct and positive integers, the smallest four distinct numbers are 1,2,3,4, which sum to 10.
so to get 12, maybe 1,2,3,6.
so 1+2+3+6=12.
then the list would be [1,2,3,6,9,9].
let's check the properties.
sum: 1+2+3+6+9+9=30.
the mode is 9, which appears twice.
are there other modes?
no, all others appear once.
so unique mode is 9.
the number of elements is 6, which is even.
the median would be the average of the third and fourth numbers.
sorted list: [1,2,3,6,9,9].
third number is 3, fourth is 6.
their average is (3+6)/2=4.5, which is not an integer.
so that doesn't satisfy the condition that the median is a positive integer.
so this list is invalid.
alternatively, perhaps the other four numbers can be 1,1,3,7.
wait, sum is 1+1+3+7=12.
then the list would be 1,1,3,7,9,9.
sum is 30.
the mode would be 1 and 9, both appearing twice, which violates the unique mode.
so that's bad.
alternatively, to avoid that, maybe use different numbers.
wait, but if we have two 9s, and need the remaining four numbers to sum to 12, with each appearing once.
then the four numbers need to be distinct.
the minimal sum of four distinct numbers is 1+2+3+4=10.
so to get 12, we can replace 4 with 5, so 1+2+3+6=12, or other combinations like 1+2+4+5=12.
let's take 1,2,4,5.
then the list would be 1,2,4,5,9,9.
sorted list: 1,2,4,5,9,9.
median is (4+5)/2=4.5, not an integer.
not valid.
alternatively, if the remaining four numbers are 2,3,3,4.
wait, but then numbers 3 and 9 would both appear twice?
no, 3 appears twice, but 9 is two.
so that's bimodal.
alternatively, maybe three 9s.
wait, three 9s sum to 27, so remaining three numbers sum to 3.
the only possibility is three 1s, which gives a bimodal list.
as before.
so again, that's invalid.
wait, maybe three 9s and then other numbers.
but 9 appears three times, and others must appear less than three times.
let's see.
let's suppose three 9s, sum 27.
the remaining three numbers sum to 3.
the only possible combination is three 1s.
which makes the list bimodal.
so that's bad.
alternatively, two 1s and a single 1?
wait, sum would be 1+1+1=3, but that's three 1s again.
so unavoidable bimodal list here.
therefore, perhaps three 9s is not可行.
what about four 9s?
four 9s sum to 36, which is over 30.
so that's impossible.
so the only other option is one 9.
wait, but then the mode is unique as 9.
but if there's only one 9, how can that be the unique mode?
unless other numbers appear less than once, but that's not possible.
wait, no.
if 9 appears once, then other numbers must appear fewer than once, which is impossible.
so the mode must be at least two.
wait, but earlier reasoning showed that if the mode is 9, which is supposed to be the unique mode, then if we have two 9s, other numbers can be present but must not have frequency more than one.
but in that case, the list would have two 9s and four other distinct numbers (sum 6 elements total).
however, as above, the median would be the average of third and fourth numbers, which might not be an integer.
alternatively, maybe a list with eight elements.
let's think bigger.
let's suppose eight elements.
if the list has eight elements, sum is 30.
the mode is 9, so 9 appears more than any other number.
let's say two 9s.
then the remaining six numbers must sum to 30 - 18 = 12.
to have 9 as the unique mode, all other numbers must appear once.
if six distinct numbers, each appearing once, summing to 12.
the smallest six distinct positive integers are 1,2,3,4,5,6, which sum to 21.
that's too much.
so we need six distinct numbers summing to 12.
that's impossible, because 1+2+3+4+5+6=21, which is way over.
alternatively, maybe repeating numbers.
but if we repeat numbers, then their frequency increases.
for example, using three 1s, but then 1 would appear three times, which is more than some other numbers.
but if 9 appears only twice, then 1 could appear three times, which would make the mode 1, unless 9 appears more frequently.
so contradiction.
therefore, if we have two 9s, to avoid other numbers having frequency two, we need all other numbers to appear once.
but since their sum needs to be 12 with at least six numbers, which is not possible.
so this approach isn't可行.
alternatively, maybe three 9s.
sum 27.
remaining three numbers sum to 3.
three numbers: three 1s.
but that's a bimodal list.
alternatively, two 1s and one 1?
no, same thing.
so again, bimodal.
alternatively, is there a way to have three 9s and other numbers with different frequencies?
for example, three 9s, one 3, and six 0s, but numbers must be positive integers.
so no zeros.
hmm.
alternatively, three 9s, sum 27.
then need three numbers summing to 3.
the only way is three 1s, which leads to bimodal list.
so seems like this is impossible.
wait, unless there is a list where 9 appears twice, but other numbers appear only once, but their sum is 12 with six numbers.
wait, but as we saw, with six distinct numbers starting from 1, sum is 1+2+3+4+5+6=21, which is too high.
so maybe not distinct, but numbers can repeat.
but if numbers repeat, then their frequency increases, which could challenge the mode.
for example, suppose two 9s, and six numbers which include two 2s, two 3s, and two 4s.
then sum would be 2*2 + 2*3 + 2*4 = 20.
but we need sum to be 12.
alternatively, this is not possible.
wait, perhaps this approach is not feasible.
let me think again.
maybe the list has ten elements.
let's see.
ten elements, sum is 30.
the mode is 9.
so 9 appears more times than any other number.
let's say two 9s.
then the remaining eight numbers must sum to 30 - 18 = 12.
again, having eight positive integers summing to 12.
the minimal sum is 8 (eight 1s), so we need to distribute 12 -8=4 more among them.
but if we have eight numbers, each at least 1, with sum 12.
so possible combinations: seven 1s and one 5, or six 1s and two 3s, etc.
let's see.
for example, two 3s and six 1s.
then the list would be 3,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,9,9.
sorted list: 1,1,1,1,1,1,3,3,9,9.
median is average of 5th and 6th elements, both 1, so average is 1, which is in the list.
so that doesn't satisfy the condition.
alternatively, one 6 and nine 1s?
wait, no, sum would be 15.
wait, need sum 12.
let me correct.
if we have eight numbers summing to 12.
possible distribution could be eight 1s and 4, sum is 12.
so the list would be 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,9,9.
wait, nine elements?
wait, no.
wait, ten elements: eight 1s, one 4, and one 9.
but sum is 8*1 +4 +9=21, which is less than 30.
so need more numbers.
wait, total numbers would be ten.
so eight numbers summing to 12: for example, seven 1s, one 5.
sum:7+5=12.
then the list is seven 1s, one 5, two 9s.
total ten elements.
sum is 7*1 +5 +18=30.
the mode here is 1, appearing seven times, which contradicts the unique mode being 9.
so invalid.
alternatively, six 1s, two 3s.
sum 6*1 +6=12.
list is six 1s, two 3s, two 9s.
total ten elements.
sum is 6 +6 +18=30.
but mode is 1, appearing six times.
again contradicts.
alternatively, five 1s, one 7.
sum 5 +7=12.
list is five 1s, one 7, two 9s.
total eight elements.
wait, no.
need eight numbers summing to 12.
so sorted list would be 1,1,1,1,1,7,9,9.
but sum is 5 +7 +18=30.
number of elements is eight.
wait, but earlier thought was ten elements.
wait, conflicting.
wait, original assumption was ten elements: if two 9s, sum of the remaining eight numbers is 12.
for example, five 1s, one 7, two 0s, but numbers must be positive.
so two 1s instead.
wait, not sure.
let me re-examine.
wait, if the list has ten elements, two of them are 9s, contributing 18.
the remaining eight elements must sum to 12.
these eight elements must be positive integers.
the minimal sum for eight positive integers is 8 (all 1s).
so to get a sum of 12, we need an additional 4.
so we can distribute these 4 over the eight elements.
for example, one possible way is four 2s and four 1s.
sum:4*2 +4*1=8+4=12.
then the list would be four 2s, four 1s, and two 9s.
total ten elements.
sum is 4*2 +4*1 +2*9=8+4+18=30.
the mode would be both 1 and 2, appearing four times each, which contradicts the unique mode 9.
so invalid.
alternatively, three 2s, five 1s.
sum:3*2 +5*1=6+5=11.
not 12.
add one more to make 12.
maybe three 2s, four 1s, and one 3.
sum:3*2 +4*1 +1*3=6+4+3=13.
not 12.
alternatively, two 3s, six 1s.
sum:2*3 +6*1=6+6=12.
then the list is two 3s, six 1s, two 9s.
total ten elements.
sum:6+6+18=30.
but mode is 1, appearing six times.
contradicts unique mode 9.
so still bad.
another distribution: one 4, seven 1s.
sum:4 +7=11.
add one more.
one 4, six 1s, one 2.
sum:4+6+2=12.
so list is one 4, six 1s, one 2, two 9s.
total ten elements.
sorted list:1,1,1,1,1,1,2,4,9,9.
sum:6+2+4+18=30.
mode is 1, appearing six times.
so invalid.
alternatively, another distribution: two 2s, two 3s, four 1s.
sum:2*2 +2*3 +4*1=4+6+4=14.
not 12.
hmm.
this is getting complicated.
maybe the list needs to have a different number of elements.
let's try seven elements.
wait, seven is odd, so the median is the fourth element, which is in the list, which is invalid.
so seven is out.
let's try eight elements.
eight elements, sum 30, mode 9, median is integer not in list.
let's see.
suppose two 9s.
then remaining six elements sum to 12.
possible distributions: six 1s (sum 6), need additional 6.
maybe three 3s and three 1s.
sum:3*3 +3*1=9+3=12.
list would be three 3s, three 1s, two 9s.
total eight elements.
sum:9+3+18=30.
but the mode would be 1 and 3, each appearing three times.
so bimodal.
invalid.
alternatively, two 4s, two 2s, two 1s.
sum:2*4 +2*2 +2*1=8+4+2=14.
not 12.
another distribution: one 6, four 1s, one 2.
sum:6+4+2=12.
list is one 6, four 1s, one 2, two 9s.
total eight elements.
sum:6+4+2+18=30.
mode is 1, appearing four times.
invalid.
alternatively, one 5, one 7.
wait, sum 5+7=12.
list is one 5, one 7, two 9s, and six elements?
wait, total eight elements.
so remaining six elements need to sum to 0.
no, impossible.
wait, maybe i need to have three 9s.
three 9s sum 27.
remaining five elements must sum to 3.
only possible if five 1s.
so list is five 1s, three 9s.
total eight elements.
sum:5+27=32.
which is over 30.
so invalid.
alternatively, three 9s (27).
then remaining five elements sum to 3.
if four 1s and one 0, but 0 is not allowed.
so impossible.
so perhaps nine elements.
let's see.
wait, nine is odd.
median is the fifth element.
which must be in the list, so invalid.
so nine is out.
another angle: let's think about the median.
since the list must have an even number of elements, let's suppose four elements.
the minimal even number.
but four elements sum to 30.
if two 9s, sum 18, remaining two elements sum 12.
for example, 6 and 6.
then list is 6,6,9,9.
sum 30.
the mode is 6 and 9, which is bimodal.
invalid.
if two 9s, and two other different numbers: 5 and 7.
list:5,7,9,9.
sum 5+7+18=30.
but the mode is still 9, appearing twice.
other numbers appear once.
so unique mode is 9.
then the median is (7+9)/2=8.
which is not in the list, as 8 is not one of the numbers.
therefore, does this work?
wait, let's check all conditions.
1. sum of the items is 30: 5 +7 +9 +9 = 30.
yes.
2. unique mode is 9: 9 appears twice, which is more than any other number.
correct.
3. median is a positive integer not in the list.
the sorted list is [5,7,9,9].
median is (7 +9)/2=8, which is not in the list.
perfect.
so this list satisfies all conditions.
let me verify again.
sum:5 +7 +9 +9=30.
yes.
mode:9 is the unique mode because it appears twice, which is more than 5 or 7, which each appear once.
median:8, which is not in the list.
so all conditions are satisfied.
therefore, this must be the list.
so the numbers are 5,7,9,9.
now, the problem asks for the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.
so compute 52 +72 +92 +92.
let's calculate:
52=25
72=49
92=81
so 25 +49 +81 +81=25+49=74, 74+81=155, 155+81=236.
let me confirm: 25+49=74, 74+81=155, 155+81=236.
wait, but if the list is 5,7,9,9, then sum of squares is 52+72+92+92=25+49+81+81=236.
therefore, the answer is 236.
wait, but earlier when i tried two 9s and two other numbers summing to 12, i considered 6 and 6, but that led to bimodal list.
but with 5 and 7, which both appear once, so unique mode is 9.
so that works.
so why didn't i think of this earlier.
median is 8, which is not in the list, perfect.
so this list meets all criteria.
hence, the answer should be 236.
**final answer** 
\boxed{236}

answer: to solve the problem, we need to find a list of positive integers that meets the following conditions:
1. the sum of the items in the list is 30.
2. the unique mode of the list is 9.
3. the median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.

we start by considering the properties of the list:
- the mode is 9, which must appear more frequently than any other number.
- the list must have an even number of elements for the median to be an integer not in the list (average of the two middle numbers).

after several trials and considerations, we find that a list with four elements: 5, 7, 9, 9 satisfies all conditions:
1. sum: \(5 + 7 + 9 + 9 = 30\).
2. unique mode: 9 appears twice, more than any other number.
3. median: the average of the two middle numbers (7 and 9) is 8, which is not in the list.

next, we calculate the sum of the squares of all the items in the list:
\[
5^2 + 7^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236
\]

thus, the sum of the squares of all the items in the list is \(\boxed{236}\).<conclusion>
