The last line of your response should be of the following format: '\\boxed{$LETTER}' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of A, B, C, and D. Think step by step before answering.\n\nParticles are collided at the center of a spherical detector producing new type of particles that travel uninterrupted at ultra-relativistic velocities highly centered around Lorentz factor of ~20. On average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reaches the detector inner walls. \nThe radius of the detector is 30 meters.\n\nWhat Lorentz factor is needed in order to have about two thirds of these particles reaching the detector inner walls?\n\nA) 40\nB) 54\nC) 28\nD) 68",
