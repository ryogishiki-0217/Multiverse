  "problem": "Answer the following multiple choice question. The last line of your response should be of the following format: '\\boxed{$LETTER}' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of A, B, C, and D. Think step by step before answering.\n\nYou are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?\n\nA) The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.\nB) The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.\nC) The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.\nD) The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.",
