  "problem": "Answer the following multiple choice question. The last line of your response should be of the following format: '\\boxed{$LETTER}' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of A, B, C, and D. Think step by step before answering.\n\nConsider a system of three spins S1, S2 and S3. Each of which can take spin +1 and -1. The energy of the system is given by, E= -J[ S1S2 +S1S3+S2S3 ].\nFind the partition function Z of the system. (\\beta = 1/kT , k= boltzmann constant and T= temperature)\n\nA) Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta)\nB) Z= 6e^(2J\\beta)+2e^(-2J\\beta)\nC) Z= 2 e^(-3J\\beta)+6e^(J\\beta)\nD) Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta)",
