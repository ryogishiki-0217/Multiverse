  "problem": "Answer the following multiple choice question. The last line of your response should be of the following format: '\\boxed{$LETTER}' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of A, B, C, and D. Think step by step before answering.\n\nThe Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current (J) versus voltage (V) behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The equation can be expressed as\n$ J = \\frac{9}{8} \\epsilon \\mu \\frac{V^2}{L^3}$\nwhere $\\epsilon$ is the dielectric constant, $\\mu$ is the charge carrier mobility, and L is the length of the device. Which of the following statements is true about the validity of this equation?\n\n\nA) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.\nB) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.\nC) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.\nD) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.",
