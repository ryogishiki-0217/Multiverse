  "problem": "Answer the following multiple choice question. The last line of your response should be of the following format: '\\boxed{$LETTER}' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of A, B, C, and D. Think step by step before answering.\n\nTwo stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?\n\nA) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]\n\nB) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n\nC) ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]\n\nD) ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]\n",
