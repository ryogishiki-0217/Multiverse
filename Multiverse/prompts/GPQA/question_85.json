  "problem": "Answer the following multiple choice question. The last line of your response should be of the following format: '\\boxed{$LETTER}' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of A, B, C, and D. Think step by step before answering.\n\nTwo planets have been detected orbiting a star using both the transit and radial velocity (RV) methods. The star has a mass of 1.5 times that of the Sun, a radius 1.2 times that of the Sun, and an effective temperature (Teff) of 6300 K. Planet1 has a mass equivalent to 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times that of Earth, while Planet2 has a mass equivalent to 5 Earth masses and a radius 1.3 times that of Earth. Interestingly, both planets are in circular orbits. Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 Å in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 Å. Assuming that both planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2?\n\nA) ~ 1.05\nB) ~ 1.30\nC) ~ 0.53\nD) ~ 0.98",
