  "problem": "Answer the following multiple choice question. The last line of your response should be of the following format: '\\boxed{$LETTER}' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of A, B, C, and D. Think step by step before answering.\n\nA chemist performs two reactions:\n\nReaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. \n\nReaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.\n\nBoth reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?\n\nA) 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC\nB) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\nC) 3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC\nD) 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC",
  "answer": "A"
