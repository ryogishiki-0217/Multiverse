The last line of your response should be of the following format: '\\boxed{$LETTER}' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of A, B, C, and D. Think step by step before answering.\n\n Consider a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass $m$ and maximum amplitude $A$ obeying Hook's law ($F=-kx$). What is the maximum speed  $v_max$ of the mass? The speed of light is $c$.\n\nA) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})}}$\nB) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}}$\nC) $v_{max}=c\\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{kA^2}{2m})^2}}$\nD) $v_{max}=\\sqrt{\\frac{kA^2}{m}}$",
