The last line of your response should be of the following format: '\\boxed{$LETTER}' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of A, B, C, and D. Think step by step before answering.\n\nWe want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.\nSo far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? \n\nA) 40%\nB) 48%\nC) 44%\nD) 52%",
