  "problem": "Answer the following multiple choice question. The last line of your response should be of the following format: '\\boxed{$LETTER}' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of A, B, C, and D. Think step by step before answering.\n\nAn organic chemist performs two reactions.\nReaction I:\n(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup.\nReaction II:\nPentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup.\nThe progress of the reactions is monitored using TLC. After the reactions are 100% completed, the products from both reactions are combined, and run on both a normal-phase HPLC column and an HPLC column packed with the chiral stationary phase.\nHow many peaks does the chemist observe in the chromatograms?\n\nA) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nB) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC\nC) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC\nD) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC",
  "answer": "D"
