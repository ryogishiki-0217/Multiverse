  "problem": "Answer the following multiple choice question. The last line of your response should be of the following format: '\\boxed{$LETTER}' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of A, B, C, and D. Think step by step before answering.\n\nThe study of quantum mechanics deals with a lot of matrices. Consider the following matrices. \n\nW = (0, 0, 1; 0, 1, 0; 1, 0, 0), \nX = (i, -1, 2i; 1, 0, 1;  2i, -1, -i),\nY = (0.5, 0.1, 0.2; 0.1, 0.25, 0.1; 0.2, 0.1, 0.25)\nZ - (3, 2i, 5; -2i, -2, -4i; 5, 4i, 4)\n\nNote. The matrices are formatted such that each row of the matrix is separated by a semicolon.  \n\nBased on these matrices, choose the correct statement.\n\n\nA) Z and X represent observables.\nB) There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes.\nC) W and X represent the evolution operator of some quantum system.\nD) (e^X)*Y*(e^{-X}) represents a quantum state.",
