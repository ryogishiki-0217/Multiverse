The last line of your response should be of the following format: '\\boxed{$LETTER}' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of A, B, C, and D. Think step by step before answering.\n\nTwo compounds A and B are treated separately with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water. Through the mentioned treatment two different diketones are produced. Select the proper starting materials A and B for the reactions.\nA + (NaNO2, HCl, H2O) ---> 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione\nB + (NaNO2, HCl, H2O) ---> 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione\n\nA) A = 4-isopropyl-2-methoxycyclohexan-1-ol, B = 5-methylhexan-2-one\nB) A = 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one, B = 5-methylhexane-2,3-diol\nC) A = 4-isopropyl-2-methoxycyclohexan-1-ol, 5-methylhexane-2,3-diol\nD) A = 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one, B = 5-methylhexan-2-one",
