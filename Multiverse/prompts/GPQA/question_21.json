  "problem": "Answer the following multiple choice question. The last line of your response should be of the following format: '\\boxed{$LETTER}' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of A, B, C, and D. Think step by step before answering.\n\nCompounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nAmong the given compounds (benzoquinone & cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) and among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate which one will show optical isomerism (B).\n\nA) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nB) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\nC) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate\nD) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate",
  "answer": "B"
