  "problem": "Answer the following multiple choice question. The last line of your response should be of the following format: '\\boxed{$LETTER}' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of A, B, C, and D. Think step by step before answering.\n\nThere is a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu (= gamma*Sz), aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction; both fields have the same magnitude, B. The average of the z-component of the particleâ€™s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?\n\nA) gamma*B\nB) gamma*B/2\nC) gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nD) sqrt(2)*gamma*B",
  "answer": "A"
