  "problem": "A piecewise linear periodic function is defined by $f(x)=\\begin{cases}x&\\text{if }x\\in[-1,1)\\\\2-x&\\text{if }x\\in[1,3)\\end{cases}$ and $f(x+4)=f(x)$ for all real numbers $x$. The graph of $f(x)$ has the sawtooth pattern. The parabola $x=34y^2$ intersects the graph of $f(x)$ at finitely many points. The sum of the $y$-coordinates of these intersection points can be expressed in the form $\\frac{a+b\\sqrt{c}}{d}$, where $a,b,c,$ and $d$ are positive integers, $a,b,$ and $d$ have greatest common divisor equal to 1, and $c$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $a+b+c+d$."
