  "problem": "Define $f(x)=|| x|-\\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \\[y=4 g(f(\\sin (2 \\pi x))) \\quad\\text{ and }\\quad x=4 g(f(\\cos (3 \\pi y))).\\]",
  "solution": "If we graph $4g(f(x))$, we see it forms a sawtooth graph that oscillates between $0$ and $1$ (for values of $x$ between $-1$ and $1$, which is true because the arguments are between $-1$ and $1$). Thus by precariously drawing the graph of the two functions in the square bounded by $(0,0)$, $(0,1)$, $(1,1)$, and $(1,0)$, and hand-counting each of the intersections, we get $\\boxed{385}$\n\nNote\nWhile this solution might seem unreliable (it probably is), the only parts where counting the intersection might be tricky is near $(1,1)$. Make sure to count them as two points and not one, or you'll get $384$.\nWe will denote $h(x)=4g(f(x))$ for simplicity. Denote $p(x)$ as the first equation and $q(y)$ as the graph of the second. We notice that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ oscillate between 0 and 1. The intersections are thus all in the square $(0,0)$, $(0,1)$, $(1,1)$, and $(1,0)$. Every $p(x)$ wave going up and down crosses every $q(y)$ wave. Now, we need to find the number of times each wave touches 0 and 1.\n\nWe notice that $h(x)=0$ occurs at $x=-\\frac{3}{4}, -\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{3}{4}$, and $h(x)=1$ occurs at $x=-1, -\\frac{1}{2}, 0,\\frac{1}{2},1$. A sinusoid passes through each point twice during each period, but it only passes through the extrema once. $p(x)$ has 1 period between 0 and 1, giving 8 solutions for $p(x)=0$ and 9 solutions for $p(x)=1$, or 16 up and down waves. $q(y)$ has 1.5 periods, giving 12 solutions for $q(y)=0$ and 13 solutions for $q(y)=1$, or 24 up and down waves. This amounts to $16\\cdot24=384$ intersections.\n\nHowever, we have to be very careful when counting around $(1, 1)$. At this point, $q(y)$ has an infinite downwards slope and $p(x)$ is slanted, giving us an extra intersection; thus, we need to add 1 to our answer to get $\\boxed{385}$.\n~Xyco\nWe can easily see that only $x, y \\in \\left[0,1 \\right]$ may satisfy both functions.\nWe call function $y = 4g \\left( f \\left( \\sin \\left( 2 \\pi x \\right) \\right) \\right)$ as Function 1 and function $x = 4g \\left( f \\left( \\cos \\left( 3 \\pi y \\right) \\right) \\right)$ as Function 2.\nFor Function 1, in each interval $\\left[ \\frac{i}{4} , \\frac{i+1}{4} \\right]$ with $i \\in \\left\\{ 0, 1, \\cdots, 3 \\right\\}$, Function 1's value oscillates between 0 and 1. It attains 1 at $x = \\frac{i}{4}$, $\\frac{i+1}{4}$ and another point between these two.\nBetween two consecutive points whose functional values are 1, the function first decreases from 1 to 0 and then increases from 0 to 1. \nSo the graph of this function in this interval consists of 4 monotonic pieces.\nFor Function 2, in each interval $\\left[ \\frac{i}{6} , \\frac{i+1}{6} \\right]$ with $i \\in \\left\\{ 0, 1, \\cdots, 5 \\right\\}$, Function 2's value oscillates between 0 and 1. It attains 1 at $y = \\frac{i}{6}$, $\\frac{i+1}{6}$ and another point between these two.\nBetween two consecutive points whose functional values are 1, the function first decreases from 1 to 0 and then increases from 0 to 1.\nSo the graph of this function in this interval consists of 4 monotonic curves.\nConsider any region $\\left[ \\frac{i}{4} , \\frac{i+1}{4} \\right] \\times \\left[ \\frac{j}{6} , \\frac{j+1}{6} \\right]$ with $i \\in \\left\\{ 0, 1, \\cdots, 3 \\right\\}$ and $j \\in \\left\\{0, 1, \\cdots , 5 \\right\\}$ but $\\left( i, j \\right) \\neq \\left( 3, 5 \\right)$.\nBoth functions have four monotonic pieces.\nBecause Function 1's each monotonic piece can take any value in  $\\left[ \\frac{j}{6} , \\frac{j+1}{6} \\right]$ and Function 2' each monotonic piece can take any value in  $\\left[ \\frac{i}{4} , \\frac{i+1}{4} \\right]$, Function 1's each monotonic piece intersects with Function 2's each monotonic piece. \nTherefore, in the interval $\\left[ \\frac{i}{4} , \\frac{i+1}{4} \\right] \\times \\left[ \\frac{j}{6} , \\frac{j+1}{6} \\right]$, the number of intersecting points is $4 \\cdot 4 = 16$.\nNext, we prove that if an intersecting point is on a line $x = \\frac{i}{4}$ for $i \\in \\left\\{ 0, 1, \\cdots, 4 \\right\\}$, then this point must be $\\left( 1, 1 \\right)$.\nFor $x = \\frac{i}{4}$, Function 1 attains value 1. \nFor Function 2, if $y = 1$, then $x = 1$. \nTherefore, the intersecting point is $\\left( 1, 1 \\right)$.\nSimilarly, we can prove that if an intersecting point is on a line $y = \\frac{i}{6}$ for $i \\in \\left\\{ 0, 1, \\cdots, 6 \\right\\}$, then this point must be $\\left( 1, 1 \\right)$.\nTherefore, in each region $\\left[ \\frac{i}{4} , \\frac{i+1}{4} \\right] \\times \\left[ \\frac{j}{6} , \\frac{j+1}{6} \\right]$ with $i \\in \\left\\{ 0, 1, \\cdots, 3 \\right\\}$ and $j \\in \\left\\{0, 1, \\cdots , 5 \\right\\}$ but $\\left( i, j \\right) \\neq \\left( 3, 5 \\right)$, all 16 intersecting points are interior.\nThat is, no two regions share any common intersecting point.\nNext, we study region  $\\left[ \\frac{3}{4} , 1 \\right] \\times \\left[ \\frac{5}{6} , 1 \\right]$.\nConsider any pair of monotonic pieces, where one is from Function 1 and one is from Function 2, except the pair of two monotonic pieces from two functions that attain $\\left( 1 , 1 \\right)$.\nTwo pieces in each pair intersects at an interior point on the region.\nSo the number of intersecting points is $4 \\cdot 4 - 1 = 15$.\nFinally, we compute the number intersection points of two functions' monotonic pieces that both attain $\\left( 1, 1 \\right)$.\nOne trivial intersection point is $\\left( 1, 1 \\right)$.\nNow, we study whether they intersect at another point.\nDefine $x = 1 - x'$ and $y = 1 - y'$.\nThus, for positive and sufficiently small $x'$ and $y'$, Function 1 is reduced to\n\\[ y' = 4 \\sin 2 \\pi x' \\hspace{1cm} (1) \\]\nand Function 2 is reduced to\n\\[ x' = 4 \\left( 1 - \\cos 3 \\pi y' \\right) . \\hspace{1cm} (2) \\]\nNow, we study whether there is a non-zero solution.\nBecause we consider sufficiently small $x'$ and $y'$, to get an intuition and quick estimate, we do approximations of the above equations.\nEquation (1) is approximated as\n\\[ y' = 4 \\cdot 2 \\pi x' \\]\nand Equation (2) is approximated as\n\\[ x' = 2 \\left( 3 \\pi y' \\right)^2  \\]\nTo solve these equations, we get $x' = \\frac{1}{8^2 \\cdot 18 \\pi^4}$ and $y' = \\frac{1}{8 \\cdot 18 \\pi^3}$.\nTherefore, two functions' two monotonic pieces that attain $\\left( 1, 1 \\right)$ have two intersecting points.\nPutting all analysis above, the total number of intersecting points is $16 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 6 + 1 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(385) }}$.\n~Steven Chen (Professor Chen Education Palace, www.professorchenedu.com)",
