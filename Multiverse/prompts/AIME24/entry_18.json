  "problem": "Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \\((a,b,c)\\) satisfying \\(a + b + c = 300\\) and\n\\begin{equation*}\na^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.\n\\end{equation*}",
  "solution": "$a^2(b+c)+b^2(a+c)+c^2(a+b) = 6000000$, thus $a^2(300-a)+b^2(300-b)+c^2(300-c) = 6000000$. Complete the cube to get $-(a-100)^3-(b-100)^3+(c-100)^3 = 9000000-30000(a+b+c)$, which so happens to be 0. Then we have $(a-100)^3+(b-100)^3+(c-100)^3 = 0$. We can use Fermat's last theorem here to note that one of a, b, c has to be 100. We have 200+200+200+1 = 601.\nWe have\n\\begin{align*}\n& a^2 b + a^2 c + b^2 a + b^2 c + c^2 a + c^2 b \\\\\n& = ab \\left( a + b \\right) + bc \\left( b + c \\right) + ca \\left( c + a \\right) \\\\\n& = ab \\left( 300 - c \\right) + bc \\left( 300 - a \\right) + ca \\left( 300 - b \\right) \\\\\n& = 300 \\left( ab + bc + ca \\right) - 3 abc \\\\\n& = -3 \\left(\n\\left( a - 100 \\right) \\left( b - 100 \\right) \\left( c - 100 \\right)\n- 10^4 \\left( a + b + c \\right) + 10^6\n\\right) \\\\\n& = -3 \\left(\n\\left( a - 100 \\right) \\left( b - 100 \\right) \\left( c - 100 \\right)\n- 2 \\cdot  10^6\n\\right) \\\\\n& = 6 \\cdot 10^6 .\n\\end{align*}\nThe first and the fifth equalities follow from the condition that $a+b+c = 300$.\nTherefore,\n\\[\n\\left( a - 100 \\right) \\left( b - 100 \\right) \\left( c - 100 \\right) = 0 .\n\\]\nCase 1: Exactly one out of $a - 100$, $b - 100$, $c - 100$ is equal to 0.\nStep 1: We choose which term is equal to 0. The number ways is 3.\nStep 2: For the other two terms that are not 0, we count the number of feasible solutions.\nW.L.O.G, we assume we choose $a - 100 = 0$ in Step 1. In this step, we determine $b$ and $c$.\nRecall $a + b + c = 300$. Thus, $b + c = 200$.\nBecause $b$ and $c$ are nonnegative integers and $b - 100 \\neq 0$ and $c - 100 \\neq 0$, the number of solutions is 200.\nFollowing from the rule of product, the number of solutions in this case is $3 \\cdot 200 = 600$.\nCase 2: At least two out of $a - 100$, $b - 100$, $c - 100$ are equal to 0.\nBecause $a + b + c = 300$, we must have $a = b = c = 100$.\nTherefore, the number of solutions in this case is 1.\nPutting all cases together, the total number of solutions is $600 + 1 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(601) }}$.\n\n~Steven Chen (Professor Chen Education Palace, www.professorchenedu.com)\nWe will use Vieta's formulas to solve this problem. We assume $a + b + c = 300$, $ab + bc + ca = m$, and $abc = n$. Thus $a$, $b$, $c$ are the three roots of a cubic polynomial $f(x)$.\nWe note that $300m = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca)=\\sum_{cyc} a^2b + 3abc = 6000000 + 3n$, which simplifies to $100m - 2000000 = n$.\nOur polynomial $f(x)$ is therefore equal to $x^3 - 300x^2 + mx - (100m - 2000000)$. Note that $f(100) = 0$, and by polynomial division we obtain $f(x) = (x - 100)(x^2 - 200x - (m-20000))$.\nWe now notice that the solutions to the quadratic equation above are $x = 100 \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{200^2 - 4(m - 20000)}}{2} = 100 \\pm \\sqrt{90000 - 4m}$, and that by changing the value of $m$ we can let the roots of the equation be any pair of two integers which sum to $200$. Thus any triple in the form $(100, 100 - x, 100 + x)$ where $x$ is an integer between $0$ and $100$ satisfies the conditions.\nNow to count the possible solutions, we note that when $x \\ne 100$, the three roots are distinct; thus there are $3! = 6$ ways to order the three roots. As we can choose $x$ from $0$ to $99$, there are $100 \\cdot 3! = 600$ triples in this case. When $x = 100$, all three roots are equal to $100$, and there is only one triple in this case.\nIn total, there are thus $\\boxed{601}$ distinct triples.\n~GaloisTorrent <3\nLet's define $a=100+x$, $b=100+y$, $c=100+z$. Then we have $x+y+z=0$ and $6000000 = \\sum a^2(b+c)$\n$= \\sum (100+x)^2(200-x) = \\sum (10000+200x+x^2)(200-x) = \\sum (20000 - 10000 x + x(40000-x^2))$\n$= \\sum (20000 + 30000 x -x^3) = 6000000 - \\sum x^3$, so we get $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 0$. Then from $x+y+z = 0$, we can find $0 = x^3+y^3+z^3 = x^3+y^3-(x+y)^3 = 3xyz$, which means that one of $a$, $b$,$c$ must be 0. There are 201 solutions for each of $a=0$, $b=0$ and $c=0$, and subtract the overcounting of 2 for solution $(200, 200, 200)$, the final result is $201 \\times 3 - 2 = \\boxed{601}$.\nDan Li\n\ndan",
