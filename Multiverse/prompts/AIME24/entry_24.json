  "problem": "Find the number of ways to place a digit in each cell of a 2x3 grid so that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is $999$, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is $99$. The grid below is an example of such an arrangement because $8+991=999$ and $9+9+81=99$.\n\\[\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \\hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\\\ \\hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array}\\]",
  "solution": "Consider this table:\n$\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \\hline a & b & c \\\\ \\hline d & e & f\\\\ \\hline \\end{array}$\nWe note that $c+f = 9$, because $c+f \\leq 18$, meaning it never achieves a unit's digit sum of $9$ otherwise. Since no values are carried onto the next digit, this implies $b+e=9$ and $a+d=9$. We can then simplify our table into this:\n$\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \\hline a & b & c \\\\ \\hline 9-a & 9-b & 9-c \\\\ \\hline \\end{array}$\nWe want $10(a+b+c) + (9-a+9-b+9-c) = 99$, or $9(a+b+c+3) = 99$, or $a+b+c=8$. Since zeroes are allowed, we just need to apply stars and bars on $a, b, c$, to get $\\tbinom{8+3-1}{3-1} = \\boxed{045}$. ~akliu",
