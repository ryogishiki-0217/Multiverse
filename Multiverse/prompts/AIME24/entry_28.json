  "problem": "Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$.",
  "solution": "We note that by changing a digit to $1$ for the number $\\overline{abcd}$, we are subtracting the number by either $1000(a-1)$, $100(b-1)$, $10(c-1)$, or $d-1$. Thus, $1000a + 100b + 10c + d \\equiv 1000(a-1) \\equiv 100(b-1) \\equiv 10(c-1) \\equiv d-1 \\pmod{7}$. We can casework on $a$ backwards, finding the maximum value.\n(Note that computing $1000 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7}, 100 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}, 10 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$ greatly simplifies computation).\nApplying casework on $a$, we can eventually obtain a working value of $\\overline{abcd} = 5694 \\implies \\boxed{699}$. ~akliu\nLet our four digit number be $abcd$. Replacing digits with 1, we get the following equations:\n$1000+100b+10c+d \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$\n$1000a+100+10c+d \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$\n$1000a+100b+10+d \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$\n$1000a+100b+10c+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$\nReducing, we get\n$6+2b+3c+d \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$ $(1)$\n$6a+2+3c+d \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$ $(2)$\n$6a+2b+3+d \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$ $(3)$\n$6a+2b+3c+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$ $(4)$\nSubtracting $(2)-(1), (3)-(2), (4)-(3), (4)-(1)$, we get:\n$3a-b \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$\n$2b-3c \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7}$\n$3c-d \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$\n$6a-d \\equiv 5 \\pmod{7}$\nFor the largest 4 digit number, we test values for a starting with 9. When a is 9, b is 4, c is 3, and d is 7.  However, when switching the digits with 1, we quickly notice this doesnt work. Once we get to a=5, we get b=6,c=9,and d=4. Adding 694 with 5, we get $\\boxed{699}$ -westwoodmonster\nLet our four digit number be $abcd$. Replacing digits with 1, we get the following equations:\n$1000+100b+10c+d \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$\n$1000a+100+10c+d \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$\n$1000a+100b+10+d \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$\n$1000a+100b+10c+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$\nAdd the equations together, we get:\n$3000a+300b+30c+3d+1111 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$\nAnd since the remainder of 1111 divided by 7 is 5, we get:\n$3abcd \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$\nWhich gives us:\n$abcd \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$\nAnd since we know that changing each digit into 1 will make abcd divisible by 7, we get that $d-1$, $10c-10$, $100b-100$, and $1000a-1000$ all have a remainder of 3 when divided by 7. Thus, we get $a=5$, $b=6$, $c=9$, and $d=4$. Thus, we get 5694 as abcd, and the answer is $694+5=\\boxed{699}$.\n~Callisto531\nLet our four digit number be $abcd$. Replacing digits with 1, we get the following equations:\n$1000+100b+10c+d \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$\n$1000a+100+10c+d \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$\n$1000a+100b+10+d \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$\n$1000a+100b+10c+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$\nThen, we let x, y, z, t be the smallest whole number satisfying the following equations:\n$1000a \\equiv x \\pmod{7}$\n$100b \\equiv y \\pmod{7}$\n$10a \\equiv z \\pmod{7}$\n$d \\equiv t \\pmod{7}$\nSince 1000, 100, 10, and 1 have a remainder of 6, 2, 3, and 1 when divided by 7, we can get the equations of:\n(1): $6+y+z+t \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$\n(2): $x+2+z+t \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$\n(3): $x+y+3+t \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$\n(4): $x+y+z+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$\nAdd (1), (2), (3) together, we get:\n$2x+2y+2z+3t+11 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$\nWe can transform this equation to:\n$2(x+y+z+1)+3t+9 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$\nSince, according to (4), $x+y+z+1$ has a remainder of 0 when divided by 7, we get:\n$3t+9 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$\nAnd because t is 0 to 6 due to it being a remainder when divided by 7, we use casework and determine that t is 4.\nUsing the same methods of simplification, we get that x=2, y=5, and z=6, which means that 1000a, 100b, 10c, and d has a remainder of 2, 5, 6, and 4, respectively. Since a, b, c, and d is the largest possible number between 0 to 9, we use casework to determine the answer is a=5, b=6, c=9, and d=4, which gives us an answer of $5+694=\\boxed{699}$\n~Callisto531 and his dad",
