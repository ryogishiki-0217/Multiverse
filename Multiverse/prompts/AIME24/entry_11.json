  "solution": "We use simple geometry to solve this problem. \n\nWe are given that $A$, $D$, $H$, and $G$ are concyclic; call the circle that they all pass through circle $\\omega$ with center $O$. We know that, given any chord on a circle, the perpendicular bisector to the chord passes through the center; thus, given two chords, taking the intersection of their perpendicular bisectors gives the center. We therefore consider chords $HG$ and $AD$ and take the midpoints of $HG$ and $AD$ to be $P$ and $Q$, respectively. \n\nWe could draw the circumcircle, but actually it does not matter for our solution; all that matters is that $OA=OH=r$, where $r$ is the circumradius. \nBy the Pythagorean Theorem, $OQ^2+QA^2=OA^2$. Also, $OP^2+PH^2=OH^2$. We know that $OQ=DE+HP$, and $HP=\\dfrac{184}2=92$; $QA=\\dfrac{16}2=8$; $OP=DQ+HE=8+17=25$; and finally, $PH=92$. Let $DE=x$. We now know that $OA^2=(x+92)^2+8^2$ and $OH^2=25^2+92^2$. Recall that $OA=OH$; thus, $OA^2=OH^2$. We solve for $x$: \n\\begin{align*}\n(x+92)^2+8^2&=25^2+92^2 \\\\\n(x+92)^2&=625+(100-8)^2-8^2 \\\\\n&=625+10000-1600+64-64 \\\\\n&=9025 \\\\\nx+92&=95 \\\\\nx&=3. \\\\\n\\end{align*}\nThe question asks for $CE$, which is $CD-x=107-3=\\boxed{104}$.\n~Technodoggo\nSuppose $DE=x$. Extend $AD$ and $GH$ until they meet at $P$. From the [Power of a Point Theorem](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Power_of_a_Point_Theorem), we have $(PH)(PG)=(PD)(PA)$. Substituting in these values, we get $(x)(x+184)=(17)(33)=561$. We can use guess and check to find that $x=3$, so $EC=\\boxed{104}$.\n\n~alexanderruan\n~diagram by Technodoggo\nWe find that \\[\\angle GAB = 90-\\angle DAG = 90 - (180 - \\angle GHD) = \\angle DHE.\\]\nLet $x = DE$ and $T = FG \\cap AB$. By similar triangles $\\triangle DHE \\sim \\triangle GAB$ we have $\\frac{DE}{EH} = \\frac{GT}{AT}$. Substituting lengths we have $\\frac{x}{17} = \\frac{16 + 17}{184 + x}.$ Solving, we find $x = 3$ and thus $CE = 107 - 3 = \\boxed{104}$.\n~AtharvNaphade ~coolruler ~eevee9406\nOne liner: $107-\\sqrt{92^2+25^2-8^2}+92=\\boxed{104}$\n~Bluesoul\n\nExplanation\nLet $OP$ intersect $DF$ at $T$ (using the same diagram as Solution 2).\nThe formula calculates the distance from $O$ to $H$ (or $G$), $\\sqrt{92^2+25^2}$, then shifts it to $OD$ and the finds the distance from $O$ to $Q$, $\\sqrt{92^2+25^2-8^2}$. $107$ minus that gives $CT$, and when added to $92$, half of $FE=TE$, gives $CT+TE=CE$\nLet $\\angle{DHE} = \\theta.$ This means that $DE = 17\\tan{\\theta}.$ Since quadrilateral $ADHG$ is cyclic, $\\angle{DAG} = 180 - \\angle{DHG} = 90 - \\theta$.\nLet $X = AG \\cap DF.$ Then, $\\Delta DXA \\sim \\Delta FXG,$ with side ratio $16:17.$ Also, since $\\angle{DAG} = 90 - \\theta, \\angle{DXA} = \\angle{FXG} = \\theta.$ Using the similar triangles, we have $\\tan{\\theta} = \\frac{16}{DX} = \\frac{17}{FX}$ and $DX + FX = DE + EF = 17\\tan{\\theta} + 184$.\nSince we want $CE = CD - DE = 107 - 17\\tan{\\theta},$ we only need to solve for $\\tan{\\theta}$ in this system of equations. Solving yields $\\tan{\\theta} = \\frac{3}{17},$ so $CE = \\boxed{104.}$\n~PureSwag\nUsing a ruler (also acting as a straight edge), draw the figure to scale with one unit = 1mm. With a compass, draw circles until you get one such that $A,D,H,G$ are on the edge of the drawn circle. From here, measuring with your ruler should give $CE = \\boxed{104.}$\nNote: 1 mm is probably the best unit to use here just for convenience (drawing all required parts of the figure fits into a normal-sized scrap paper 8.5 x 11); also all lines can be drawn with a standard 12-inch ruler \n~kipper",
