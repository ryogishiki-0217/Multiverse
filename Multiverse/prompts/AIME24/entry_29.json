  "problem": "Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\n[asy] unitsize(0.3 inch); draw(ellipse((0,0), 3, 1.75)); draw((-1.2,0.1)..(-0.8,-0.03)..(-0.4,-0.11)..(0,-0.15)..(0.4,-0.11)..(0.8,-0.03)..(1.2,0.1)); draw((-1,0.04)..(-0.5,0.12)..(0,0.16)..(0.5,0.12)..(1,0.04)); draw((0,2.4)--(0,-0.15)); draw((0,-0.15)--(0,-1.75), dashed); draw((0,-1.75)--(0,-2.25)); draw(ellipse((2,0), 1, 0.9)); draw((2.03,-0.02)--(2.9,-0.4)); [/asy]",
  "solution": "First, let's consider a section $\\mathcal{P}$ of the solids, along the axis.\nBy some 3D-Geomerty thinking, we can simply know that the axis crosses the sphere center. So, that is saying, the $\\mathcal{P}$ we took crosses one of the equator of the sphere.\nHere I drew two graphs, the first one is the case when $T$ is internally tangent to $S$,\n\nand the second one is when $T$ is externally tangent to $S$.\n\nFor both graphs, point $O$ is the center of sphere $S$, and points $A$ and $B$ are the intersections of the sphere and the axis. Point $E$ (ignoring the subscripts) is one of the circle centers of the intersection of torus $T$ with section $\\mathcal{P}$. Point $G$ (again, ignoring the subscripts) is one of the tangents between the torus $T$ and sphere $S$ on section $\\mathcal{P}$. $EF\\bot CD$, $HG\\bot CD$.\nAnd then, we can start our calculation.\nIn both cases, we know $\\Delta OEF\\sim \\Delta OGH\\Longrightarrow \\frac{EF}{OE} =\\frac{GH}{OG}$.\nHence, in the case of internal tangent, $\\frac{E_iF_i}{OE_i} =\\frac{G_iH_i}{OG_i}\\Longrightarrow \\frac{6}{11-3} =\\frac{r_i}{11}\\Longrightarrow r_i=\\frac{33}{4}$.\nIn the case of external tangent, $\\frac{E_oF_o}{OE_o} =\\frac{G_oH_o}{OG_o}\\Longrightarrow \\frac{6}{11+3} =\\frac{r_o}{11}\\Longrightarrow r_o=\\frac{33}{7}$.\nThereby, $r_i-r_o=\\frac{33}{4}-\\frac{33}{7}=\\frac{99}{28}$. And there goes the answer, $99+28=\\boxed{\\mathbf{127} }$\n~Prof_Joker",
