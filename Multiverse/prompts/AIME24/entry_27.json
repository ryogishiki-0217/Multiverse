  "problem": "Alice chooses a set $A$ of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets $B$ of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of $B$ belongs to $A$. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.",
  "solution": "Let $k$ be one of the elements in Alices set $A$ of positive integers. The number of sets that Bob lists with the property that their maximum element is k is $2^{k-1}$, since every positive integer less than k can be in the set or out. Thus, for the number of sets bob have listed to be 2024, we want to find a sum of unique powers of two that can achieve this. 2024 is equal to $2^{10}+2^9+2^8+2^7+2^6+2^5+2^3$. We must increase each power by 1 to find the elements in set $A$, which are $(11,10,9,8,7,6,4)$. Add these up to get $\\boxed{055}$. -westwoodmonster\nLet $A = \\left\\{ a_1, a_2, \\cdots, a_n \\right\\}$ with $a_1 < a_2 < \\cdots < a_n$.\nIf the maximum element of $B$ is $a_i$ for some $i \\in \\left\\{ 1, 2, \\cdots , n \\right\\}$, then each element in $\\left\\{ 1, 2, \\cdots, a_i- 1 \\right\\}$ can be either in $B$ or not in $B$.\nTherefore, the number of such sets $B$ is $2^{a_i - 1}$.\nTherefore, the total number of sets $B$ is\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sum_{i=1}^n 2^{a_i - 1} & = 2024 .\n\\end{align*}\nThus\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sum_{i=1}^n 2^{a_i} & = 4048 .\n\\end{align*}\nNow, the problem becomes writing 4048 in base 2, say, $4048 = \\left( \\cdots b_2b_1b_0 \\right)_2$.\nWe have $A = \\left\\{ j \\geq 1: b_j = 1 \\right\\}$.\nWe have $4048 = \\left( 111,111,010,000 \\right)_2$.\nTherefore, $A = \\left\\{ 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 \\right\\}$.\nTherefore, the sum of all elements in $A$ is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(55) }}$.\n~Steven Chen (Professor Chen Education Palace, www.professorchenedu.com)",
