  "problem": "Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.",
  "solution": "Let's first try some experimentation. Alice obviously wins if there is one coin. She will just take it and win. If there are 2 remaining, then Alice will take one and then Bob will take one, so Bob wins. If there are $3$, Alice will take $1$, Bob will take one, and Alice will take the final one. If there are $4$, Alice will just remove all $4$ at once. If there are $5$, no matter what Alice does, Bob can take the final coins in one try. Notice that Alice wins if there are $1$, $3$, or $4$ coins left. Bob wins if there are $2$ or $5$ coins left.\nAfter some thought, you may realize that there is a strategy for Bob. If there is n is a multiple of $5$, then Bob will win. The reason for this is the following: Let's say there are a multiple of $5$ coins remaining in the stack. If Alice takes $1$, Bob will take $4$, and there will still be a multiple of $5$. If Alice takes $4$, Bob will take $1$, and there will still be a multiple of $5$. This process will continue until you get $0$ coins left. For example, let's say there are $205$ coins. No matter what Alice does, Bob can simply just do the complement. After each of them make a turn, there will always be a multiple of $5$ left. This will continue until there are $5$ coins left, and Bob will end up winning.\nAfter some more experimentation, you'll realize that any number that is congruent to $2$ mod $5$ will also work. This is because Bob can do the same strategy, and when there are $2$ coins left, Alice is forced to take $1$ and Bob takes the final coin. For example, let's say there are $72$ coins. If Alice takes $1$, Bob will take $4$. If Alice takes $4$, Bob will take $1$. So after they each make a turn, the number will always be equal to $2$ mod $5$. Eventually, there will be only $2$ coins remaining, and we've established that Alice will simply take $1$ and Bob will take the final coin.\nSo we have to find the number of numbers less than or equal to $2024$ that are either congruent to $0$ mod $5$ or $2$ mod $5$. There are $404$ numbers in the first category: $5, 10, 15, \\dots, 2020$. For the second category, there are $405$ numbers. $2, 7, 12, 17, \\dots, 2022$. So the answer is $404 + 405 = \\boxed{809}$\n~lprado\nWe will use winning and losing positions, where a $W$ marks when Alice wins and an $L$ marks when Bob wins.\n$1$ coin: $W$\n$2$ coins: $L$\n$3$ coins: $W$\n$4$ coins: $W$\n$5$ coins: $L$\n$6$ coin: $W$\n$7$ coins: $L$\n$8$ coins: $W$\n$9$ coins: $W$\n$10$ coins: $L$\n$11$ coin: $W$\n$12$ coins: $L$\n$13$ coins: $W$\n$14$ coins: $W$\n$15$ coins: $L$\nWe can see that losing positions occur when $n$ is congruent to $0, 2 \\mod{5}$ and winning positions occur otherwise. In other words, there will be $2$ losing positions out of every $5$ consecutive values of n. As $n$ ranges from $1$ to $2020$, $\\frac{2}{5}$ of these values are losing positions where Bob will win. As $n$ ranges from $2021$ to $2024$, $2022$ is the only value where Bob will win. Thus, the answer is $2020\\times\\frac{2}{5}+1=\\boxed{809}$\n~alexanderruan\nDenote by $A_i$ and $B_i$ Alice's or Bob's $i$th moves, respectively.\nCase 1: $n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$.\nBob can always take the strategy that $B_i = 5 - A_i$.\nThis guarantees him to win.\nIn this case, the number of $n$ is $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{2024}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 404$.\nCase 2: $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$.\nIn this case, consider Alice's following strategy: $A_1 = 1$ and $A_i = 5 - B_{i-1}$ for $i \\geq 2$.\nThus, under Alice's this strategy, Bob has no way to win.\nCase 3: $n \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$.\nIn this case, consider Alice's following strategy: $A_1 = 4$ and $A_i = 5 - B_{i-1}$ for $i \\geq 2$.\nThus, under Alice's this strategy, Bob has no way to win.\nCase 4: $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$.\nBob can always take the strategy that $B_i = 5 - A_i$.\nTherefore, after the $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor$th turn, there are two tokens leftover.\nTherefore, Alice must take 1 in the next turn that leaves the last token on the table.\nTherefore, Bob can take the last token to win the game.\nThis guarantees him to win.\nIn this case, the number of $n$ is $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{2024 - 2}{5} \\right\\rfloor +1 = 405$.\nCase 5: $n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$.\nConsider Alice's following strategy: $A_1 = 1$ and $A_i = 5 - B_{i-1}$ for $i \\geq 2$.\nBy doing so, there will finally be 2 tokens on the table and Bob moves first. Because Bob has the only choice of taking 1 token, Alice can take the last token and win the game.\nTherefore, in this case, under Alice's this strategy, Bob has no way to win.\nPutting all cases together, the answer is $404 + 405 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(809) }}$.\nSince the game Alice and Bob play is impartial (the only difference between player 1 and player 2 is that player 1 goes first (note that games like chess are not impartial because each player can only move their own pieces)), we can use the Sprague-Grundy Theorem to solve this problem. We will use induction to calculate the Grundy Values for this game.\nWe claim that heaps of size congruent to $0,2 \\bmod{5}$ will be in outcome class $\\mathcal{P}$ (win for player 2 = Bob), and heaps of size equivalent to $1,3,4 \\bmod{5}$ will be in outcome class $\\mathcal{N}$ (win for player 1 = Alice). Note that the mex (minimal excludant) of a set of nonnegative integers is the least nonnegative integer not in the set. e.g. mex$(1, 2, 3) = 0$ and mex$(0, 1, 2, 4) = 3$.\n\n$\\text{heap}(0) = \\{\\} = *\\text{mex}(\\emptyset) = 0$\n\n$\\text{heap}(1) = \\{0\\} = *\\text{mex}(0) = *$\n\n$\\text{heap}(2) = \\{*\\} = *\\text{mex}(1) = 0$\n\n$\\text{heap}(3) = \\{0\\} = *\\text{mex}(0) = *$\n\n$\\text{heap}(4) = \\{0, *\\} = *\\text{mex}(0, 1) = *2$\n\n$\\text{heap}(5) = \\{*, *2\\} = *\\text{mex}(1, 2) = 0$\n\n$\\text{heap}(6) = \\{0, 0\\} = *\\text{mex}(0, 0) = *$\n\n$\\text{heap}(7) = \\{*, *\\} = *\\text{mex}(1, 1) = 0$\n\n$\\text{heap}(8) = \\{*2, 0\\} = *\\text{mex}(0, 2) = *$\n\n$\\text{heap}(9) = \\{0, *\\} = *\\text{mex}(0, 1) = *2$\n\n$\\text{heap}(10) = \\{*, *2\\} = *\\text{mex}(1, 2) = 0$\n\nWe have proven the base case. We will now prove the inductive hypothesis: If $n \\equiv 0 \\bmod{5}$, $\\text{heap}(n) = 0$, $\\text{heap}(n+1) = *$, $\\text{heap}(n+2) = 0$, $\\text{heap}(n+3) = *$, and $\\text{heap}(n+4) = *2$, then $\\text{heap}(n+5) = 0$, $\\text{heap}(n+6) = *$, $\\text{heap}(n+7) = 0$, $\\text{heap}(n+8) = *$, and $\\text{heap}(n+9) = *2$.\n\n$\\text{heap}(n+5) = \\{\\text{heap}(n+1), \\text{heap}(n+4)\\} = \\{*, *2\\} = *\\text{mex}(1, 2) = 0$\n\n$\\text{heap}(n+6) = \\{\\text{heap}(n+2), \\text{heap}(n+5)\\} = \\{0, 0\\} = *\\text{mex}(0, 0) = *$\n\n$\\text{heap}(n+7) = \\{\\text{heap}(n+3), \\text{heap}(n+6)\\} = \\{*, *\\} = *\\text{mex}(1, 1) = 0$\n\n$\\text{heap}(n+8) = \\{\\text{heap}(n+4), \\text{heap}(n+7)\\} = \\{*2, 0\\} = *\\text{mex}(2, 1) = *$\n\n$\\text{heap}(n+9) = \\{\\text{heap}(n+5), \\text{heap}(n+8)\\} = \\{0, *\\} = *\\text{mex}(0, 1) = *2$\n\nWe have proven the inductive hypothesis. QED.\nThere are $2020*\\frac{2}{5}=808$ positive integers congruent to $0,2 \\bmod{5}$ between 1 and 2020, and 1 such integer between 2021 and 2024. $808 + 1 = \\boxed{809}$.\n\n~numerophile\nWe start with $n$ as some of the smaller values. After seeing the first 4 where Bob wins automatically, with trial and error we see that $2, 5, 7,$ and $10$ are spaced alternating in between 2 and 3 apart. This can also be proven with modular arithmetic, but  this is an easier solution for some people. We split them into 2 different sets with common difference 5: {2,7,12 ...} and {5,10,15...}. Counting up all the numbers in each set can be done as follows:\nSet 1 ${2,7,12...}$\n$2024-2=2022$ (because the first term is two)\n$\\lfloor \\frac{2024}{5} \\rfloor = 404$\nSet 2 ${5,10,15}$\n$\\lfloor \\frac{2024}{5} \\rfloor = 404$\n\nAnd because we forgot 2022 we add 1 more.\n$404+404+1=809$\n-Multpi12\n(Edits would be appreciated)\nLaTexed by BossLu99",
