  "problem": "Eight circles of radius $34$ are sequentially tangent, and two of the circles are tangent to $AB$ and $BC$ of triangle $ABC$, respectively. $2024$ circles of radius $1$ can be arranged in the same manner. The inradius of triangle $ABC$ can be expressed as $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\n[asy] pair A = (2,1); pair B = (0,0); pair C = (3,0); dot(A^^B^^C); label(\"$A$\", A, N); label(\"$B$\", B, S); label(\"$C$\", C, S); draw(A--B--C--cycle); for(real i=0.62; i<2.7; i+=0.29){ draw(circle((i,0.145), 0.145)); } [/asy]",
  "solution": "Draw an altitude from both end circles of the diagram with the circles of radius one, and call the lengths you get drawing the altitudes of the circles down to $BC$ $a$ and $b$. Now we have the length of side $BC$ of being $(2)(2022)+1+1+a+b$. However, the side $BC$ can also be written as $(6)(68)+34+34+34a+34b$, due to similar triangles from the second diagram. If we set the equations equal, we have $\\frac{1190}{11} = a+b$. Call the radius of the incircle $r$, then we have the side BC to be $r(a+b)$. We find $r$ as $\\frac{4046+\\frac{1190}{11}}{\\frac{1190}{11}}$, which simplifies to $\\frac{10+((34)(11))}{10}$,so we have $\\frac{192}{5}$, which sums to $\\boxed{197}$.\nAssume that $ABC$ is isosceles with $AB=AC$.\nIf we let $P_1$ be the intersection of $BC$ and the leftmost of the eight circles of radius $34$, $N_1$ the center of the leftmost circle, and $M_1$ the intersection of the leftmost circle and $AB$, and we do the same for the $2024$ circles of radius $1$, naming the points $P_2$, $N_2$, and $M_2$, respectively, then we see that $BP_1N_1M_1\\sim BP_2N_2M_2$. The same goes for vertex $C$, and the corresponding quadrilaterals are congruent.\nLet $x=BP_2$. We see that $BP_1=34x$ by similarity ratios (due to the radii). The corresponding figures on vertex $C$ are also these values. If we combine the distances of the figures, we see that $BC=2x+4046$ and $BC=68x+476$, and solving this system, we find that $x=\\frac{595}{11}$.\nIf we consider that the incircle of $\\triangle ABC$ is essentially the case of $1$ circle with $r$ radius (the inradius of $\\triangle ABC$, we can find that $BC=2rx$. From $BC=2x+4046$, we have:\n$r=1+\\frac{2023}{x}$\n$=1+\\frac{11\\cdot2023}{595}$\n$=1+\\frac{187}{5}$\n$=\\frac{192}{5}$\nThus the answer is $192+5=\\boxed{197}$.\n~eevee9406\nLet $x = \\cot{\\frac{B}{2}} + \\cot{\\frac{C}{2}}$. By representing $BC$ in two ways, we have the following:\n\\[34x + 7\\cdot 34\\cdot 2 = BC\\]\n\\[x + 2023 \\cdot 2 = BC\\]\nSolving we find $x = \\frac{1190}{11}$. \nNow draw the inradius, let it be $r$. We find that $rx =BC$, hence \n\\[xr = x + 4046 \\implies r-1 = \\frac{11}{1190}\\cdot 4046 = \\frac{187}{5}.\\]\nThus \\[r = \\frac{192}{5} \\implies \\boxed{197}.\\]\n~AtharvNaphade\nFirst, let the circle tangent to $AB$ and $BC$ be $O$ and the other circle that is tangent to $AC$ and $BC$ be $R$. Let $x$ be the distance from the tangency point on line segment $BC$ of the circle $O$ to $B$. Also, let $y$ be the distance of the tangency point of circle $R$ on the line segment $BC$ to point $C$. Realize that we can let $n$ be the number of circles tangent to line segment $BC$ and $r$ be the corresponding radius of each of the circles. Also, the circles that are tangent to $BC$ are similar. So, we can build the equation $BC = (x+y+2(n-1)) \\times r$. Looking at the given information, we see that when $n=8$, $r=34$, and when $n=2024$, $r=1$, and we also want to find the radius $r$ in the case where $n=1$. Using these facts, we can write the following equations:\n$BC = (x+y+2(8-1)) \\times 34 = (x+y+2(2024-1)) \\times 1 = (x+y+2(1-1)) \\times r$\nWe can find that $x+y = \\frac{1190}{11}$ . Now, let $(x+y+2(2024-1)) \\times 1 = (x+y+2(1-1)) \\times r$. \nSubstituting $x+y = \\frac{1190}{11}$ in, we find that \\[r = \\frac{192}{5} \\implies \\boxed{197}.\\]\n~Rainier2020\nDefine $I, x_1, x_8, y_1, y_{2024}$ to be the incenter and centers of the first and last circles of the $8$ and $2024$ tangent circles to $BC,$ and define $r$ to be the inradius of triangle $\\bigtriangleup ABC.$ We calculate $\\overline{x_1x_8} = 34 \\cdot 14$ and $\\overline{y_1y_{2024}} = 1 \\cdot 4046$ because connecting the center of the circles voids two extra radii.\n\nWe can easily see that $B, x_1, x_8,$ and $I$ are collinear, and the same follows for $C, y_1, y_2024,$ and $I$ (think angle bisectors).\n\nWe observe that triangles $\\bigtriangleup I x_1 x_8$ and $\\bigtriangleup I y_1 y_{2024}$ are similar, and therefore the ratio of the altitude to the base is the same, so we note\n\\[\\frac{\\text{altitude}}{\\text{base}} = \\frac{r-34}{34\\cdot 14} = \\frac{r-1}{1\\cdot 4046}.\\]\n\nSolving yields $r = \\frac{192}{5},$ so the answer is $192+5 = \\boxed{197}$.\n-[spectraldragon8](https://artofproblemsolving.comhttps://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/User:Spectraldragon8)",
