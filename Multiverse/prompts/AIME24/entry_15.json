  "problem": "Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be point on the hyperbola $\\frac{x^2}{20}- \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.",
  "solution": "A quadrilateral is a rhombus if and only if its two diagonals bisect each other and are perpendicular to each other. The first condition is automatically satisfied because of the hyperbola's symmetry about the origin. To satisfy the second condition, we set $BD$ as the line $y = mx$ and $AC$ as $y = -\\frac{1}{m}x.$ Because the hyperbola has asymptotes of slopes $\\pm \\frac{\\sqrt6}{\\sqrt5},$ we have $m, -\\frac{1}{m} \\in \\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt6}{\\sqrt5}, \\frac{\\sqrt6}{\\sqrt5}\\right).$ This gives us $m^2 \\in \\left(\\frac{5}{6}, \\frac{6}{5}\\right)$.\n\nPlugging $y = mx$ into the equation for the hyperbola yields $x^2 = \\frac{120}{6-5m^2}$ and $y^2 = \\frac{120m^2}{6-5m^2}.$ By symmetry of the hyperbola, we know that $\\left(\\frac{BD}{2}\\right)^2 = x^2 + y^2,$ so we wish to find a lower bound for $x^2 + y^2 = 120\\left(\\frac{1+m^2}{6-5m^2}\\right).$ This is equivalent to minimizing $\\frac{1+m^2}{6-5m^2} = -\\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{11}{5(6-5m^2)}$. It's then easy to see that this expression increases with $m^2,$ so we plug in $m^2 = \\frac{5}{6}$ to get $x^2+y^2 > 120,$ giving $BD^2 > \\boxed{480}$.\nAssume $AC$ is the asymptope of the hyperbola, $BD$ in that case is the smallest. The expression of $BD$ is $y=-\\sqrt{\\frac{5}{6}}x$. Thus, we could get $\\frac{x^2}{20}-\\frac{y^2}{24}=1\\implies x^2=\\frac{720}{11}$. The desired value is $4\\cdot \\frac{11}{6}x^2=480$. This case wouldn't achieve, so all $BD^2$ would be greater than $\\boxed{480}$\n~Bluesoul\n$\\textbf{warning: this solution is wrong}$\nThe pythagorean theorem in the last step is missing a factor of 2 - this was a lucky \"solve\".\nA square is a rhombus. Take B to have coordinates $(x,x)$ and D to have coordinates $(-x,-x)$. This means that $x$ satisfies the equations $\\frac{x^2}{20}-\\frac{x^2}{24}=1 \\rightarrow x^2=120$. This means that the distance from $B$ to $D$ is $\\sqrt{2x^2+2x^2}\\rightarrow 2x = \\sqrt{480}$. So $BD^2 = \\boxed{480}$. We use a square because it minimizes the length of the long diagonal (also because it's really easy).\n~amcrunner\nThe only \"numbers\" provided in this problem are $24$ and $20$, so the answer must be a combination of some operations on these numbers. If you're lucky, you could figure the most likely option is $24\\cdot 20$, as this yields $\\boxed{480}$ and seems like a plausible answer for this question.\n~Mathkiddie",
