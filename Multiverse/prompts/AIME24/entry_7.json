  "problem": "Let $\\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.",
  "solution": "Observe that the \"worst\" possible box is one of the maximum possible length. \nBy symmetry, the height and the width are the same in this antioptimal box. (If the height and width weren't the same, the extra difference between them could be used to make the length longer.) Thus, let the width and height be of length $a$ and the length be $L$. \nWe're given that the volume is $23$; thus, $a^2L=23$. We're also given that the surface area is $54=2\\cdot27$; thus, $a^2+2aL=27$. \nFrom the first equation, we can get $L=\\dfrac{23}{a^2}$. We do a bunch of algebra: \n\\begin{align*}\nL&=\\dfrac{23}{a^2} \\\\\n27&=a^2+2aL \\\\\n&=a^2+2a\\left(\\dfrac{23}{a^2}\\right) \\\\\n&=a^2+\\dfrac{46}a \\\\\n27a&=a^3+46 \\\\\na^3-27a+46&=0. \\\\\n\\end{align*}\nWe can use the Rational Root Theorem and test a few values. It turns out that $a=2$ works. We use synthetic division to divide by $a-2$: \n[Asdf.png](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/File:Asdf.png)\nAs we expect, the remainder is $0$, and we are left with the polynomial $x^2+2x-23$. We can now simply use the quadratic formula and find that the remaining roots are $\\dfrac{-2\\pm\\sqrt{4-4(-23)}}2=\\dfrac{-2\\pm\\sqrt{96}}2=\\dfrac{-2\\pm4\\sqrt{6}}2=-1\\pm2\\sqrt6$. We want the smallest $a$ to maximize $L$, and it turns out that $a=2$ is in fact the smallest root. Thus, we let $a=2$. Substituting this into $L=\\dfrac{23}{a^2}$, we find that $L=\\dfrac{23}4$. However, this is not our answer! This is simply the length of the box; we want the radius of the sphere enclosing it. We know that the diameter of the sphere is the diagonal of the box, and the 3D Pythagorean Theorem can give us the space diagonal. Applying it, we find that the diagonal has length $\\sqrt{2^2+2^2+\\left(\\dfrac{23}4\\right)^2}=\\sqrt{8+\\dfrac{529}{16}}=\\sqrt{\\dfrac{128+529}{16}}=\\dfrac{\\sqrt{657}}4$. This is the diameter; we halve it to find the radius, $\\dfrac{\\sqrt{657}}8$. We then square this and end up with $\\dfrac{657}{64}$, giving us an answer of $657+64=\\boxed{721}$. \n~Technodoggo\nDenote by $x$, $y$, $z$ the length, width, and height of a rectangular box.\nWe have\n\\begin{align*}\nxy + yz + zx & = \\frac{54}{2}  \\hspace{1cm} (1) \\\\\nxyz & = 23 \\hspace{1cm} (2)\n\\end{align*}\nWe have\n\\begin{align*}\n4 r^2 & = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\\\\n& = \\left( x + y + z \\right)^2 - 2 \\cdot \\left( xy + yz + zx \\right) \\\\\n& = \\left( x + y + z \\right)^2 - 54 .\n\\end{align*}\nTherefore, we solve the following constrained optimization problem:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\max_{x,y,z} \\ & x + y + z \\\\\n\\mbox{subject to } & (1), (2) \n\\end{align*}\nFirst, we prove that an optimal solution must have at least two out of $x$, $y$, $z$ that are the same.\nDenote by $\\lambda$ and $\\eta$ lagrangian multipliers of constraints (1) and (2), respectively. \nConsider the following Lagrangian:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\max_{x,y,z, \\lambda, \\eta} & x + y + z + \\lambda \\left( xy + yz + zx - 27 \\right)\n+ \\eta \\left( xyz - 23 \\right) .\n\\end{align*}\nTaking first-order-condition with respect to $x$, $y$, $z$, respectively, we get\n\\begin{align*}\n1 + \\lambda \\left( y + z \\right) + \\eta yz & = 0 \\hspace{1cm} (3) \\\\\n1 + \\lambda \\left( z + x \\right) + \\eta zx & = 0 \\hspace{1cm} (4) \\\\\n1 + \\lambda \\left( x + y \\right) + \\eta xy & = 0 \\hspace{1cm} (5)\n\\end{align*}\nSuppose there is an optimal solution with $x$, $y$, $z$ that are all distinct.\nTaking $(4)-(3)$, we get\n\\[ \\left( x - y \\right) \\left( \\lambda + \\eta z \\right) = 0 . \\]\nBecause $x \\neq y$, we have\n\\[ \\lambda + \\eta z = 0 \\hspace{1cm} (6) \\]\nAnalogously, we have\n\\begin{align*}\n\\lambda + \\eta x & = 0 \\hspace{1cm} (7) \n\\end{align*} \nTaking $(6) - (7)$, we get $\\eta \\left( z - x \\right) = 0$.\nBecause $z \\neq x$, we have $\\eta = 0$. Plugging this into (6), we get $\\lambda = 0$.\nHowever, the solution that $\\lambda = \\eta = 0$ is a contradiction with (3).\nTherefore, in an optimal solution, we cannot have $x$, $y$, and $z$ to be all distinct.\nW.L.O.G, in our remaining analysis, we assume an optimal solution satisfies $y = z$.\nTherefore, we need to solve the following two-variable optimization problem:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\max_{x,y} \\ & x + 2y \\\\\n\\mbox{subject to } & 2 xy + y^2 = 27 \\\\\n& xy^2 = 23\n\\end{align*}\nReplacing $x$ with $y$ by using the constraint $xy^2 = 23$, we solve the following single-variable optimization problem:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\max_y \\ &  \\frac{23}{y^2} + 2y \\hspace{1cm} (8) \\\\\n\\mbox{subject to } & \\frac{46}{y} + y^2 = 27 \\hspace{1cm} (9)\n\\end{align*}\nBy solving (9), we get $y = 2$ and $-1 + 2 \\sqrt{6}$.\nPlugging $y = 2$ into (8), we get $\\frac{23}{y^2} + 2y = \\frac{39}{4}$.\nPlugging $y = -1 + 2 \\sqrt{6}$ into (8), we get $\\frac{23}{y^2} + 2y = \\frac{96 \\sqrt{6} - 21}{23}$.\nWe have $\\frac{96 \\sqrt{6} - 21}{23} < \\frac{39}{4}$.\nTherefore, the maximum value of $x + y + z$ is $\\frac{39}{4}$.\nTherefore,\n\\begin{align*}\nr^2 & = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( \\left( x + y + z \\right)^2 - 54 \\right) \\\\\n& = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( \\left( \\frac{39}{4} \\right)^2 - 54 \\right) \\\\\n& = \\frac{657}{64} .\n\\end{align*}\nTherefore, the answer is\n$657 + 64 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(721) }}$.\n~Steven Chen (Professor Chen Education Palace, www.professorchenedu.com)\nFirst, let's list the conditions:\nDenote by $l$, $w$, $h$ the length, width, and height of a rectangular box.\n\\[lwh=23\\]\n\\begin{align*}\n2(lw+wh+hl)&=54\\\\\nlw+wh+hl&=27.\n\\end{align*}\nApplying the Pythagorean theorem, we can establish that\n\\begin{align*}\n(2r)^2&=(l^2+w^2+h^2)\\\\\n4r^2&=(l^2+w^2+h^2)\\\\\n4r^2&=(l+w+h)^2-2(lw+wh+hl)\\\\\n4r^2&=(l+w+h)^2-54.\n\\end{align*}\nWe can spot Vieta's formula hidden inside this equation and call this $m$.
