Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the chemist has a white solid, and we need to identify it using the given spectral data: mass spec, IR, and 1H NMR. The options are A to D. Let's break down each piece of information.
First, the mass spectrum shows a molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100%) and a peak at m/z = 158 (32%). The presence of both M+ at 156 and M+2 at 158 suggests the molecule contains a halogen, probably chlorine, because chlorine has two isotopes with masses 35 and 37, which would give that M+ and M+2 pattern. The relative intensity of 32% for M+2 is about a third, which is typical for chlorine (since the natural abundance of 37Cl is about 24%, but maybe combined in some groups). So, the molecule likely has one chlorine atom. The molecular ion m/z 156 would then correspond to the molecular weight minus electrons, so the molecular formula should have a mass around 156. Let me calculate the exact mass later when I know the structure.
Next, the IR spectrum: a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1, which is typical of O-H stretching (like in a carboxylic acid or alcohol), and a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is likely a carbonyl group (C=O). So, combining the broad O-H and the carbonyl, maybe a carboxylic acid (COOH group) or an ester or maybe a ketone with a hydroxyl group. But carboxylic acid has broad O-H and a carbonyl at around 1700 cm^-1. However, 1720 is a bit higher, maybe an ester or an acid chloride? Wait, acid chlorides have carbonyl stretching around 1800 cm^-1, maybe a ketone or ester. Wait, 1720 is more in the range of esters or perhaps a ketone? But also considering the O-H... Hmm. Wait, maybe it's a chloroformate? Because phenyl chloroformate (option C) has a carbonyl group. Wait, chloroformate is OCl-O-CO- group. Its IR might show a carbonyl at 1720. Not sure. Let's hold that thought.
The NMR data: a singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H), which is probably a proton that is strongly deshielded. That could be a carboxylic acid proton (though usually around 10-12 ppm, but possible). Alternatively, a hydroxyl group in exchange broadening might not show, but here it's a singlet at 11.0, so maybe it's a COOH proton or a hydroxyl. Wait, but hydroxyls are usually broad singlets, but in NMR they often exchange and are integrated as singlets. But 11.0 ppm is quite high. Carboxylic acid protons are around that area, but a singlet suggests symmetry or no neighboring protons. Wait, benzoic acid would have the COOH proton as a broad singlet, but if it's 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the proton at the carboxyl would be a singlet. Then aromatic protons: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H). This suggests two doublets, each with two protons, which is a pattern for ortho or para substitution. Wait, let's think. In para-substituted benzene, like chlorobenzoic acid, the aromatic protons next to the substituents would be split into doublets. For example, in para-chlorobenzoic acid, the ring would have substituents at positions 1 and 4: Cl at para to COOH. Then the aromatic protons would be split into two doublets due to coupling between the adjacent protons.
But in benzoic acid, the proton at position 2 (assuming COOH at 1) is deshielded, but maybe in chlorobenzoic acid, depending on where the Cl is, you can have different splitting. Wait, let's see the options. Option A is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. If the Cl is at position 4 (para to COOH), then the aromatic protons at positions 3 and 5 would be equivalent, each neighboring the COOH and Cl. Wait, maybe not. Let me draw it. Suppose COOH is at position 1, Cl at position 4. Then the protons at positions 2 and 6 would be adjacent to COOH and Cl, but I think all the aromatic protons para to the substituents might be split. Wait, perhaps the NMR signals are from the aromatic protons ortho to the substituents. For example, in para-substituted benzene rings, the protons ortho to substituents are deshielded and split due to coupling. In 4-chlorobenzoic acid, there are two pairs of ortho protons. Each pair would be split as doublets. For example, the protons at positions 2 and 6 (ortho to COOH and Cl) might be doublets. Wait, but if the substituents are para, then positions 2, 3, 5, and 6 all have neighboring substituents. Wait, maybe the splitting is due to the adjacent protons. Wait, in a para-substituted benzene, each proton has two adjacent protons (since the substituents are at positions 1 and 4). So, the coupling would be between those adjacent protons. Wait, but in a para-substituted benzene, all aromatic protons are equivalent pairs. Wait, no. If substituents are at positions 1 and 4, then the protons at positions 2 and 6 are equivalent, and the protons at positions 3 and 5 are equivalent. Each proton in position 2 is adjacent to protons in positions 1 (COOH), 3, and 7. Wait, maybe I need to think again.
Alternatively, let's look at the NMR: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H). This is a common splitting pattern for a para-substituted benzene with two different substituents. For example, if you have two substituents in para positions, like nitrophenyl groups, sometimes you see a similar splitting. Wait, but if the substituents are in para, the ring would have two pairs of equivalent protons. Each pair is ortho to each other and meta to the substituents. Wait, maybe each doublet corresponds to a pair of protons. Let's take 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The substituents are COOH and Cl in para positions. Then, the remaining aromatic protons would be two pairs, each adjacent to both substituents. But I'm getting confused. Alternatively, let's think about the integration: the NMR shows 1H (the singlet at 11.0), then 2H and 2H, total 5 protons? Wait, but benzene has 6 protons. If there's a substituent like COOH (which has 1 proton) and Cl (no protons), then the total protons would be 6 - 1 = 5? But wait, COOH is a substituent taking one position, Cl another. So, in chlorobenzoic acid, the benzene ring has two substituents (COOH and Cl), so only four protons left on the ring. Wait, no: six positions on the benzene ring, two are occupied by substituents (COOH and Cl), so four protons. Wait, but the NMR shows 1H (COOH?) and then 2H + 2H aromatic. So total protons reported in NMR would be 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. But benzene minus two substituents would have four aromatic protons. Hmm. This is confusing. Wait, maybe the molecule is not chlorobenzoic acid but something else. Let's consider option C: phenyl chloroformate. Structure would be Ph-O-CO-Cl. Let's think about its NMR. The phenyl group (Ph) would have protons. If the chloroformate is attached, the ring would be ortho/para substituted. The O and Cl substituents would influence the proton NMR shifts. The carbonyl would be in the IR at 1720 (which matches). The singlet at 11.0 ppm: could that be a proton from the chloroformate? Wait, chloroformate is OCl-O-CO-Ph. The ester group has a carbonyl. The chloroformate ester (PhOCOCl) would have a Ph group, then OCOCl. The Ph protons would be split depending on substitution. If the ester is attached to the benzene ring, say at position 1, then the adjacent protons (position 2 and 6) would be deshielded. But chloroformate is an ortho/para director. Wait, but maybe the structure is such that there are two doublets due to coupling between adjacent protons. Alternatively, if the chloroformate is attached at a position where there are two protons each in different environments. Alternatively, let's look at the IR again: broad O-H stretch (maybe from a hydroxyl group?), but phenyl chloroformate doesn't have an O-H. Wait, unless there's a hydroxyl group somewhere. Wait, option D is 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure would be a benzene ring with Cl at position 3, OH at 2, and aldehyde at 1. That would give a structure like: 
O
|
CHO - 1
OH - 2
Cl - 3
Then, the IR would have broad O-H (from hydroxyl) and a carbonyl at 1720 (which would be the aldehyde or maybe a ketone). Wait, aldehyde has a carbonyl at around 1720 cm^-1. The singlet at 11.0 ppm could be the aldehyde proton? But aldehyde protons are typically around 9-10 ppm. Wait, 11.0 might be too high. Alternatively, the hydroxyl group could exchange and be a broad singlet around 12-13 ppm, but if it's exchange-suppressed, maybe. Wait, but 11.0 ppm is possible for an aldehyde proton. For example, in aromatic aldehydes, like benzaldehyde, the proton is around 10 ppm. If substituted with Cl and OH, the shift could be upfield or downfield. Hmm. Also, the NMR shows 8.02 and 7.72, each d (2H). In such a substituted benzaldehyde, the aromatic protons would be split. Let's see: positions 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), 3 (Cl). The remaining protons would be in positions 4,5,6. But since substituents are at positions 1,2,3, the remaining positions are meta to some substituents. Wait, but the substitution is on adjacent positions (1, 2, 3), so the ring would be highly substituted. Then, maybe there are equivalent protons. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is not an aldehyde. Let's go back.
Alternatively, option B is 2-chlorobenzoic acid. If the Cl is ortho to COOH, then the ring would have substituents at positions 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl). Then, the aromatic protons would be at positions 3,4,5,6. The protons at positions 3 and 5 would be adjacent to COOH and Cl, perhaps. But this is getting complicated. Let's look at the NMR again: two doublets of 2H each. That suggests two equivalent protons coupled to each other. Wait, but in a para-substituted ring, if there are two substituents, the remaining equivalent protons would be in pairs. Wait, maybe the molecule is actually a nitro compound? But none of the options have nitro.
Wait, the molecular ion is m/z 156. Let's calculate the molecular formula. Assuming the substance is CxHyOzCl. The approximate molecular formula can be deduced. Chlorine has an atomic mass of 35.5. Let's suppose the actual molecular mass is around 156. Let me check the options:
Option A: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The formula would be C7H5O2Cl. Calculate the mass: C: 7*12=84, H:5*1=5, O:2*16=32, Cl:35.5. Total: 84+5+32+35.5=156.5. That's close to the m/z 156 (which is the molecular ion, so maybe the exact mass is 156.5, but the m/z is 156). So that could fit. Similarly, option B: 2-chlorobenzoic acid has the same formula, C7H5O2Cl, so same molecular mass. Option C: phenyl chloroformate. Structure is PhOCOCl. So, C6H5-O-CO-Cl. Molecular formula: C6H5OClCO (CO is O and C). Wait, more accurately, C6H5-O-C(=O)-Cl. So, molecular formula is C7H7OCl (since the Ph group is C6H5, plus O, C, and Cl). The molecular mass would be C:7*12=84, H:7*1=7, O:16, Cl:35.5. Total 84+7+16+35.5=142.5. But the m/z here is 156, so that's lower. So option C would have a lower mass. Option D: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Formula: C7H6O2Cl. Because benzaldehyde is C7H6O, adding Cl makes it C7H6OCl. Wait, wait: benzaldehyde is C7H8O (but wait, wait: benzaldehyde is C6H5-CHO. The formula is C7H6O). With substitution of Cl and OH, it would be C7H6O2Cl. Molecular mass: C:7*12=84, H:6*1=6, O:2*16=32, Cl:35.5. Total: 84+6+32+35.5=157.5. Close to 156, but maybe within error. But option A and B also have molecular mass around 156-157. But the mass spec shows m/z=156.
But wait, the m/z is the mass divided by charge. For the molecular ion (M+), it would be (M)+. So m/z = (M) / 1 = M. So if the molecular mass is 156, then the exact mass should be 156. Let's recalculate option A: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. C7H5O2Cl. Exact mass: C=12.0107*7=84.0749, H=5*1.0078=5.039, O=2*15.9949=31.9898, Cl=35.453 (isotopologue), but the molecular ion would be a mixture. Wait, but the m/z given is 156 for the molecular ion. If we calculate the exact mass of C7H5O2Cl: 84.0749 + 5.039 + 31.9898 + 35.453 = 156.5567. So the m/z for the M+ would be approximately 156.5, which could show as m/z 156 or 157 (depending on the instrument). The problem states m/z 156 as the molecular ion. So if the exact mass is 156.5, it may appear as m/z 156 and 157. But the main peak is at 156 (100%). That seems a bit odd. But maybe the instrument's configuration or the specific ionization method. Alternatively, maybe the molecular formula is slightly different. Alternatively, maybe the exact mass is 156.5, but the m/z is given as the integer closest to it. Let's not overcomplicate. Let's proceed.
Now, considering the options A and B have the same formula but different substitution (para vs ortho). Option D is 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, which has a higher molecular weight (about 157.5). The mass spec shows m/z 156, so maybe option D is slightly higher. However, in reality, the m/z is often an approximate value. Let's see.
Let's look at the IR again. Broad O-H stretch (could be from a carboxylic acid, hydroxyl group, or even an aldehyde). The carbonyl at 1720 cm^-1. For option A or B (chlorobenzoic acid), the carbonyl would be the carboxylic acid group. The carboxylic acid carbonyl is around 1700 cm^-1. The 1720 cm^-1 is a bit higher, which might suggest something else, like an ester or ketone. Wait, but carboxylic acids have O-H and carbonyl. If the carbonyl is at 1720, maybe it's an ester. But if the compound is an ester, like methyl benzoate, the carbonyl is slightly upshifted. Wait, esters typically have carbonyl stretching around 1740-1720 cm^-1. So 1720 could be an ester. However, if the compound is benzoic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700. So the IR at 1720 suggests maybe an ester group. But none of the options are esters. Option C is phenyl chloroformate, which is a chloroformate ester. Its structure is PhOCOCl. The carbonyl would be in the ester group (COO-), so around 1720 cm^-1. That matches. The IR also shows a broad O-H stretch, but chloroformate doesn't have O-H. Unless there's a hydroxyl group in the structure. Wait, option C is phenyl chloroformate (no hydroxyl). Then the broad O-H in IR would be inconsistent. Therefore, option C can be eliminated because of the O-H stretch in IR.
Now, between A, B, and D. Option D is 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. This would have a hydroxyl group (broad O-H), aldehyde group (singlet at 11.0 ppm – but aldehyde protons are usually around 10 ppm, but possible). The carbonyl at 1720 would be the aldehyde. Aldehyde carbonyls are around 1720 cm^-1, so that matches. In the NMR, the singlet at 11.0 ppm could be the aldehyde proton (which is strongly deshielded). Then the aromatic protons: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). In a substituted benzaldehyde, how would the aromatic protons be split? Let's imagine the structure:
O
|
CHO - position 1
OH - position 2
Cl - position 3
The remaining aromatic protons would be at positions 4, 5, 6. But with substituents at positions 1, 2, 3, the remaining ring would not be symmetrical. Positions 4 and 6 would be adjacent to the OH and Cl, perhaps. But this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is not an aldehyde. Let's check option A and B again.
Options A and B are chlorobenzoic acids (para and ortho). The molecular formula fits the mass spec. The IR shows carboxylic acid O-H (broad) and carbonyl at 1720 (which is a bit high for a carboxylic acid but possible). Wait, maybe the carbonyl is part of another group. Wait, benzoic acid would have a COOH group. The carbonyl would be at ~1700 cm^-1. The 1720 cm^-1 here might suggest an ester or other group. If the compound is an ester of benzoic acid, then the carbonyl would be at ~1720 cm^-1. But options A and B are benzoic acids (with COOH), not esters. Therefore, the 1720 cm^-1 might not fit. However, maybe the instrument's calibration or solvent effects. Alternatively, could the compound be a different acid? For example, if it's a chloroformate (option C), which we eliminated due to O-H. Alternatively, maybe the compound is a sulfonic acid, but none of the options are that.
Wait, another thought: could the compound be phenyl chloroacetate or something else? But none of the options. Wait, the options are A) 4-Cl benzoic acid, B) 2-Cl benzoic acid, C) phenyl chloroformate, D) 3-Cl-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde.
Let's look at the NMR again. The NMR shows 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), which could be a COOH group or an aldehyde. But aldehydes typically are more reactive and the proton is around 9-10 ppm. 11.0 is higher. Maybe a carboxylic acid. But if it's benzoic acid, why is the COOH proton a singlet? Benzoic acid's proton is exchange broadened due to acidity. In NMR, it would usually be a broad singlet. But here, the entry says 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), which might indicate that. So maybe that's the COOH proton.
Then the aromatic protons: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). That suggests two doublets in the aromatic region. In a para-substituted benzoic acid (option A), the aromatic protons邻 to the substituents (COOH and Cl) would be shifted. Wait, in para nitrobenzoic acid, the protons ortho to the nitro group are deshielded. Similarly, in para chlorobenzoic acid, the protons ortho to the Cl (and adjacent to COOH) would be deshielded. Let's say in para chlorobenzoic acid (option A), the substituents are at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). Then the protons at positions 2 and 6 (ortho to COOH) and positions 3 and 5 (ortho to Cl). Wait, but those positions would have different shielding. Alternatively, maybe the doublets at 8.02 and 7.72 correspond to two pairs of equivalent protons. For example, if the substituents are in para, then positions 2 and 6 (ortho to COOH) would be equivalent, each adjacent to the COOH and a Cl (if Cl is para). Wait, but Cl is at position 4, so positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to COOH and nothing else (assuming Cl is para to COOH). Wait, no. If Cl is at position 4 and COOH at position 1, then positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to COOH, and positions 3 and 5 are adjacent to Cl. In that case, the protons at positions 2 and 6 would be in a similar environment, and the protons at 3 and 5 similarly. But if the substituents are in para, the coupling between these protons would depend on their positions. If the ring is para-substituted, the protons at positions 2 and 6 (ortho to COOH) would be adjacent to each other and would couple as a doublet. Similarly, the protons at 3 and 5 (ortho to Cl) would couple with each other. However, if the Cl is in para to COOH, then positions 2 and 6 have similar environments but split due to neighboring protons. Wait, maybe each of these protons (in positions 2,3,5,6) would couple with their neighbors. But in para substitution, let's consider the actual splitting.
Wait, in para-dichlorobenzenes, the proton NMR shows multiplets due to coupling. But in this case, if we have substituents at positions 1 and 4 (COOH and Cl), the remaining protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. Each of these protons is adjacent to two different substituents. However, positions 2 and 6 are equivalent, and positions 3 and 5 are equivalent. Each set (positions 2,6 and 3,5) would form doublets. For example, the protons at 2 and 6 (each adjacent to COOH and H) would couple with their neighboring protons. Wait, but if the substituents are in para, then each of these protons would have neighboring protons that are equivalent. Wait, if you have a para-substituted ring, like Cl at position 4 and COOH at position 1, then the protons at positions 2 and 6 would each be adjacent to COOH and H, and the protons at 3 and 5 would each be adjacent to Cl and H. However, positions 2 and 6 are equivalent, so their NMR signals would be a doublet of doublets? Wait, but if each proton in position 2 couples with position 1 (COOH, but that's a quaternary carbon) and position 3 (which is adjacent). Wait, actually, the coupling in aromatic protons is between adjacent protons. So, proton at position 2 would couple with protons at positions 1 (if not substituent), but wait, position 1 is COOH, which is a substituent. Wait, no, the coupling is between neighboring protons. For aromatic protons, coupling (J values) are usually between adjacent protons. So, in a benzene ring, each proton couples with the two adjacent protons. If there are substituents, the coupling constants may change, but the pattern depends on the equivalence.
If we have substituents in para positions (1 and 4), then the protons at 2 and 6 are equivalent, each coupled to two equivalent protons (3 and 5, and 1 which is COOH). Wait, no. Let's think again. If the substituent is COOH at position 1 and Cl at position 4. Then, the protons at position 2 and 6 are adjacent to COOH and H. Each of these protons (position 2 and 6) would couple with the protons at positions 1 (COOH – no proton) and 3. Wait, no. Wait, in a benzene ring, each proton is adjacent to two others. If we have substituents at positions 1 and 4, then each proton at 2 and 6 is adjacent to substituent COOH (position 1) and proton at 3 or 5. Wait, this is getting too complicated. Let's take an example. Suppose we have para-chlorobenzoic acid. The structure would have COOH at position 1 and Cl at position 4. Then, the aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. Protons at 2 and 6 are equivalent (due to symmetry), and protons at 3 and 5 are also equivalent. Each proton at 2 would be adjacent to COOH (position 1, no proton) and proton at 3. Similarly, proton at 3 is adjacent to protons at 2 and 4 (Cl, no proton). Wait, no. If Cl is at position 4, then proton at 3 is adjacent to protons at 2 and 4 (but position 4 is Cl, which has no proton). Therefore, the coupling would be between protons at positions 2 and 3, and between protons at 3 and 5, etc. Wait, perhaps each equivalent proton (e.g., positions 2 and 6) would couple with their neighboring protons (positions 3 and 5). Since positions 3 and 5 are equivalent, each proton at 2 and 6 would couple with two equivalent protons (3 and 5), leading to a doublet. Similarly, the protons at 3 and 5 would couple with protons at 2 and 4. But position 4 is Cl, so no proton. Therefore, each proton at 3 would couple with protons at 2 and 5. But if the structure is symmetric, maybe the protons at 2 and 6 are each coupled to two equivalent protons (3 and 5), leading to a doublet. Similarly, the protons at 3 and 5 are each coupled to two equivalent protons (2 and 6), leading to a doublet. Therefore, in total, you would have two doublets: one for positions 2 and 6, and another for positions 3 and 5. However, due to the different chemical environments (next to COOH and Cl), their chemical shifts would be different. If the COOH is at position 1, the protons at 2 and 6 are adjacent to COOH, so they would be more deshielded, hence upfield or downfield? Carboxylic acid groups are electron-withdrawing. Therefore, protonsortho to COOH are deshielded (higher ppm). Similarly, Cl is also electron-withdrawing. Therefore, the protons ortho to Cl (positions 3 and 5) would also be deshielded. But depending on the strength, maybe the COOH effect is stronger. So, the doublets for positions 2 and 6 (ortho to COOH) might be at a higher ppm than positions 3 and 5 (ortho to Cl). Wait, but in the NMR data, the signals are at 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). Chlorine is meta to COOH in this case. Wait, no, if Cl is para to COOH, then the positions ortho to Cl would be positions 3 and 5. The question is how these environments affect chemical shift. Typically, electron-withdrawing groups increase the chemical shift (upfield or downfield)? For aromatic protons, electron-withdrawing groups deshield the protons (shift upfield? Wait, no. Wait, deshielded protons appear at higher ppm in downfield. So, electron-withdrawing groups (like COOH and Cl) would deshield the adjacent protons, moving their NMR signals upfield (higher ppm). Therefore, the protons next to stronger electron-withdrawing groups would be at higher ppm. Between COOH and Cl, COOH is a stronger electron-withdrawer. Therefore, the protons ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6) would be at higher ppm than those ortho to Cl (positions 3 and 5). In the NMR data, the signals are at 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H). So, 8.02 is higher than 7.72. Therefore, this would correspond to the para substitution with COOH and Cl. So, the para substitution (option A) would give two doublets: one at 8.02 (ortho to COOH) and one at 7.72 (ortho to Cl). Therefore, this structure would fit.
But in ortho substitution (option B, 2-chlorobenzoic acid), the substituents are adjacent. Then the NMR splitting would be more complex. For example, if COOH is at position 1 and Cl at position 2, the remaining protons would have different coupling patterns. But this is getting too deep into proton NMR of substituted benzenes, which can be complex. However, the key point is that the two doublets in the NMR suggest two pairs of equivalent aromatic protons, each experiencing coupling with their neighbors. This is consistent with a para substitution (where each pair is ortho to a substituent). Therefore, option A (4-chlorobenzoic acid) would fit this NMR data.
But wait, the IR shows a broad O-H stretch. If it's benzoic acid (option A or B), that O-H is from the COOH group. However, pure benzoic acid exists as dimer in solution due to hydrogen bonding, and the proton is broad and may be a singlet. In the NMR data, the COOH proton is a singlet at 11.0 ppm. That's possible. So, putting it all together:
- Mass spec: M+ at 156, which matches the molecular weight of option A (4-chlorobenzoic acid) or B (2-chlorobenzoic acid).
- IR: Broad O-H (from COOH) and carbonyl at 1720 (which is a bit high for COOH but possible).
- NMR: Singlet at 11.0 ppm (COOH proton), and two doublets from aromatic protons. The doublets at 8.02 and 7.72 would fit a para-substituted arene (A), whereas an ortho substituent (B) would likely cause more splitting or different chemical shifts.
However, another point: if the chlorobenzoic acid is in the ortho position (B), the two substituents (COOH and Cl) are adjacent, which could lead to dihedral angles that might affect the NMR splitting. But I'm not an NMR expert. Alternatively, maybe the splitting is different. Let's think again.
In para chlorobenzoic acid (A), the two substituents are at positions 1 and 4. The protons at positions 2 and 6 are equivalent and each adjacent to COOH and H. The protons at 3 and 5 are equivalent and adjacent to Cl and H. Each set would see two equivalent neighboring protons, leading to doublets. The chemical shifts split as 8.02 and 7.72, which is reasonable for electron withdrawal by COOH and Cl.
In ortho chlorobenzoic acid (B), substituents at 1 and 2. The remaining aromatic protons would be at positions 3, 4, 5, 6. Protons at 3 and 5 (meta to COOH) and protons at 4 and 6 (adjacent to Cl and COOH). This would lead to more complicated splitting or potentially multiplets, not clean doublets. Therefore, the NMR data with two doublets suggests para substitution (option A).
Another point: the mass spectrum shows M+ at 156 and M+2 at 158 (32%). This matches the chlorine isotopes (35Cl and 37Cl). The molecular ion of 156 (calculated as C7H5O2Cl: 156.5) is consistent with option A. Therefore, considering all data (mass spec, IR, NMR), option A, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, seems the most reasonable.
Let's check option D again. 3-Chloro-2-hydroxyben

okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. so, the chemist has a white solid, and we need to identify it using the given spectral data: mass spec, ir, and 1h nmr. the options are a to d. let's break down each piece of information.
first, the mass spectrum shows a molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100%) and a peak at m/z = 158 (32%). the presence of both m+ at 156 and m+2 at 158 suggests the molecule contains a halogen, probably chlorine, because chlorine has two isotopes with masses 35 and 37, which would give that m+ and m+2 pattern. the relative intensity of 32% for m+2 is about a third, which is typical for chlorine (since the natural abundance of 37cl is about 24%, but maybe combined in some groups). so, the molecule likely has one chlorine atom. the molecular ion m/z 156 would then correspond to the molecular weight minus electrons, so the molecular formula should have a mass around 156. let me calculate the exact mass later when i know the structure.
next, the ir spectrum: a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1, which is typical of o-h stretching (like in a carboxylic acid or alcohol), and a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is likely a carbonyl group (c=o). so, combining the broad o-h and the carbonyl, maybe a carboxylic acid (cooh group) or an ester or maybe a ketone with a hydroxyl group. but carboxylic acid has broad o-h and a carbonyl at around 1700 cm^-1. however, 1720 is a bit higher, maybe an ester or an acid chloride? wait, acid chlorides have carbonyl stretching around 1800 cm^-1, maybe a ketone or ester. wait, 1720 is more in the range of esters or perhaps a ketone? but also considering the o-h... hmm. wait, maybe it's a chloroformate? because phenyl chloroformate (option c) has a carbonyl group. wait, chloroformate is ocl-o-co- group. its ir might show a carbonyl at 1720. not sure. let's hold that thought.
the nmr data: a singlet at 11.0 ppm (1h), which is probably a proton that is strongly deshielded. that could be a carboxylic acid proton (though usually around 10-12 ppm, but possible). alternatively, a hydroxyl group in exchange broadening might not show, but here it's a singlet at 11.0, so maybe it's a cooh proton or a hydroxyl. wait, but hydroxyls are usually broad singlets, but in nmr they often exchange and are integrated as singlets. but 11.0 ppm is quite high. carboxylic acid protons are around that area, but a singlet suggests symmetry or no neighboring protons. wait, benzoic acid would have the cooh proton as a broad singlet, but if it's 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the proton at the carboxyl would be a singlet. then aromatic protons: 8.02 ppm (d, 2h) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2h). this suggests two doublets, each with two protons, which is a pattern for ortho or para substitution. wait, let's think. in para-substituted benzene, like chlorobenzoic acid, the aromatic protons next to the substituents would be split into doublets. for example, in para-chlorobenzoic acid, the ring would have substituents at positions 1 and 4: cl at para to cooh. then the aromatic protons would be split into two doublets due to coupling between the adjacent protons.
but in benzoic acid, the proton at position 2 (assuming cooh at 1) is deshielded, but maybe in chlorobenzoic acid, depending on where the cl is, you can have different splitting. wait, let's see the options. option a is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. if the cl is at position 4 (para to cooh), then the aromatic protons at positions 3 and 5 would be equivalent, each neighboring the cooh and cl. wait, maybe not. let me draw it. suppose cooh is at position 1, cl at position 4. then the protons at positions 2 and 6 would be adjacent to cooh and cl, but i think all the aromatic protons para to the substituents might be split. wait, perhaps the nmr signals are from the aromatic protons ortho to the substituents. for example, in para-substituted benzene rings, the protons ortho to substituents are deshielded and split due to coupling. in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, there are two pairs of ortho protons. each pair would be split as doublets. for example, the protons at positions 2 and 6 (ortho to cooh and cl) might be doublets. wait, but if the substituents are para, then positions 2, 3, 5, and 6 all have neighboring substituents. wait, maybe the splitting is due to the adjacent protons. wait, in a para-substituted benzene, each proton has two adjacent protons (since the substituents are at positions 1 and 4). so, the coupling would be between those adjacent protons. wait, but in a para-substituted benzene, all aromatic protons are equivalent pairs. wait, no. if substituents are at positions 1 and 4, then the protons at positions 2 and 6 are equivalent, and the protons at positions 3 and 5 are equivalent. each proton in position 2 is adjacent to protons in positions 1 (cooh), 3, and 7. wait, maybe i need to think again.
alternatively, let's look at the nmr: 8.02 ppm (d, 2h) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2h). this is a common splitting pattern for a para-substituted benzene with two different substituents. for example, if you have two substituents in para positions, like nitrophenyl groups, sometimes you see a similar splitting. wait, but if the substituents are in para, the ring would have two pairs of equivalent protons. each pair is ortho to each other and meta to the substituents. wait, maybe each doublet corresponds to a pair of protons. let's take 4-chlorobenzoic acid. the substituents are cooh and cl in para positions. then, the remaining aromatic protons would be two pairs, each adjacent to both substituents. but i'm getting confused. alternatively, let's think about the integration: the nmr shows 1h (the singlet at 11.0), then 2h and 2h, total 5 protons? wait, but benzene has 6 protons. if there's a substituent like cooh (which has 1 proton) and cl (no protons), then the total protons would be 6 - 1 = 5? but wait, cooh is a substituent taking one position, cl another. so, in chlorobenzoic acid, the benzene ring has two substituents (cooh and cl), so only four protons left on the ring. wait, no: six positions on the benzene ring, two are occupied by substituents (cooh and cl), so four protons. wait, but the nmr shows 1h (cooh?) and then 2h + 2h aromatic. so total protons reported in nmr would be 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. but benzene minus two substituents would have four aromatic protons. hmm. this is confusing. wait, maybe the molecule is not chlorobenzoic acid but something else. let's consider option c: phenyl chloroformate. structure would be ph-o-co-cl. let's think about its nmr. the phenyl group (ph) would have protons. if the chloroformate is attached, the ring would be ortho/para substituted. the o and cl substituents would influence the proton nmr shifts. the carbonyl would be in the ir at 1720 (which matches). the singlet at 11.0 ppm: could that be a proton from the chloroformate? wait, chloroformate is ocl-o-co-ph. the ester group has a carbonyl. the chloroformate ester (phococl) would have a ph group, then ococl. the ph protons would be split depending on substitution. if the ester is attached to the benzene ring, say at position 1, then the adjacent protons (position 2 and 6) would be deshielded. but chloroformate is an ortho/para director. wait, but maybe the structure is such that there are two doublets due to coupling between adjacent protons. alternatively, if the chloroformate is attached at a position where there are two protons each in different environments. alternatively, let's look at the ir again: broad o-h stretch (maybe from a hydroxyl group?), but phenyl chloroformate doesn't have an o-h. wait, unless there's a hydroxyl group somewhere. wait, option d is 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. structure would be a benzene ring with cl at position 3, oh at 2, and aldehyde at 1. that would give a structure like: 
o
|
cho - 1
oh - 2
cl - 3
then, the ir would have broad o-h (from hydroxyl) and a carbonyl at 1720 (which would be the aldehyde or maybe a ketone). wait, aldehyde has a carbonyl at around 1720 cm^-1. the singlet at 11.0 ppm could be the aldehyde proton? but aldehyde protons are typically around 9-10 ppm. wait, 11.0 might be too high. alternatively, the hydroxyl group could exchange and be a broad singlet around 12-13 ppm, but if it's exchange-suppressed, maybe. wait, but 11.0 ppm is possible for an aldehyde proton. for example, in aromatic aldehydes, like benzaldehyde, the proton is around 10 ppm. if substituted with cl and oh, the shift could be upfield or downfield. hmm. also, the nmr shows 8.02 and 7.72, each d (2h). in such a substituted benzaldehyde, the aromatic protons would be split. let's see: positions 1 (cho), 2 (oh), 3 (cl). the remaining protons would be in positions 4,5,6. but since substituents are at positions 1,2,3, the remaining positions are meta to some substituents. wait, but the substitution is on adjacent positions (1, 2, 3), so the ring would be highly substituted. then, maybe there are equivalent protons. alternatively, maybe the molecule is not an aldehyde. let's go back.
alternatively, option b is 2-chlorobenzoic acid. if the cl is ortho to cooh, then the ring would have substituents at positions 1 (cooh) and 2 (cl). then, the aromatic protons would be at positions 3,4,5,6. the protons at positions 3 and 5 would be adjacent to cooh and cl, perhaps. but this is getting complicated. let's look at the nmr again: two doublets of 2h each. that suggests two equivalent protons coupled to each other. wait, but in a para-substituted ring, if there are two substituents, the remaining equivalent protons would be in pairs. wait, maybe the molecule is actually a nitro compound? but none of the options have nitro.
wait, the molecular ion is m/z 156. let's calculate the molecular formula. assuming the substance is cxhyozcl. the approximate molecular formula can be deduced. chlorine has an atomic mass of 35.5. let's suppose the actual molecular mass is around 156. let me check the options:
option a: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. the formula would be c7h5o2cl. calculate the mass: c: 7*12=84, h:5*1=5, o:2*16=32, cl:35.5. total: 84+5+32+35.5=156.5. that's close to the m/z 156 (which is the molecular ion, so maybe the exact mass is 156.5, but the m/z is 156). so that could fit. similarly, option b: 2-chlorobenzoic acid has the same formula, c7h5o2cl, so same molecular mass. option c: phenyl chloroformate. structure is phococl. so, c6h5-o-co-cl. molecular formula: c6h5oclco (co is o and c). wait, more accurately, c6h5-o-c(=o)-cl. so, molecular formula is c7h7ocl (since the ph group is c6h5, plus o, c, and cl). the molecular mass would be c:7*12=84, h:7*1=7, o:16, cl:35.5. total 84+7+16+35.5=142.5. but the m/z here is 156, so that's lower. so option c would have a lower mass. option d: 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. formula: c7h6o2cl. because benzaldehyde is c7h6o, adding cl makes it c7h6ocl. wait, wait: benzaldehyde is c7h8o (but wait, wait: benzaldehyde is c6h5-cho. the formula is c7h6o). with substitution of cl and oh, it would be c7h6o2cl. molecular mass: c:7*12=84, h:6*1=6, o:2*16=32, cl:35.5. total: 84+6+32+35.5=157.5. close to 156, but maybe within error. but option a and b also have molecular mass around 156-157. but the mass spec shows m/z=156.
but wait, the m/z is the mass divided by charge. for the molecular ion (m+), it would be (m)+. so m/z = (m) / 1 = m. so if the molecular mass is 156, then the exact mass should be 156. let's recalculate option a: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. c7h5o2cl. exact mass: c=12.0107*7=84.0749, h=5*1.0078=5.039, o=2*15.9949=31.9898, cl=35.453 (isotopologue), but the molecular ion would be a mixture. wait, but the m/z given is 156 for the molecular ion. if we calculate the exact mass of c7h5o2cl: 84.0749 + 5.039 + 31.9898 + 35.453 = 156.5567. so the m/z for the m+ would be approximately 156.5, which could show as m/z 156 or 157 (depending on the instrument). the problem states m/z 156 as the molecular ion. so if the exact mass is 156.5, it may appear as m/z 156 and 157. but the main peak is at 156 (100%). that seems a bit odd. but maybe the instrument's configuration or the specific ionization method. alternatively, maybe the molecular formula is slightly different. alternatively, maybe the exact mass is 156.5, but the m/z is given as the integer closest to it. let's not overcomplicate. let's proceed.
now, considering the options a and b have the same formula but different substitution (para vs ortho). option d is 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, which has a higher molecular weight (about 157.5). the mass spec shows m/z 156, so maybe option d is slightly higher. however, in reality, the m/z is often an approximate value. let's see.
let's look at the ir again. broad o-h stretch (could be from a carboxylic acid, hydroxyl group, or even an aldehyde). the carbonyl at 1720 cm^-1. for option a or b (chlorobenzoic acid), the carbonyl would be the carboxylic acid group. the carboxylic acid carbonyl is around 1700 cm^-1. the 1720 cm^-1 is a bit higher, which might suggest something else, like an ester or ketone. wait, but carboxylic acids have o-h and carbonyl. if the carbonyl is at 1720, maybe it's an ester. but if the compound is an ester, like methyl benzoate, the carbonyl is slightly upshifted. wait, esters typically have carbonyl stretching around 1740-1720 cm^-1. so 1720 could be an ester. however, if the compound is benzoic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700. so the ir at 1720 suggests maybe an ester group. but none of the options are esters. option c is phenyl chloroformate, which is a chloroformate ester. its structure is phococl. the carbonyl would be in the ester group (coo-), so around 1720 cm^-1. that matches. the ir also shows a broad o-h stretch, but chloroformate doesn't have o-h. unless there's a hydroxyl group in the structure. wait, option c is phenyl chloroformate (no hydroxyl). then the broad o-h in ir would be inconsistent. therefore, option c can be eliminated because of the o-h stretch in ir.
now, between a, b, and d. option d is 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. this would have a hydroxyl group (broad o-h), aldehyde group (singlet at 11.0 ppm – but aldehyde protons are usually around 10 ppm, but possible). the carbonyl at 1720 would be the aldehyde. aldehyde carbonyls are around 1720 cm^-1, so that matches. in the nmr, the singlet at 11.0 ppm could be the aldehyde proton (which is strongly deshielded). then the aromatic protons: 8.02 ppm (d, 2h) and 7.72 (d, 2h). in a substituted benzaldehyde, how would the aromatic protons be split? let's imagine the structure:
o
|
cho - position 1
oh - position 2
cl - position 3
the remaining aromatic protons would be at positions 4, 5, 6. but with substituents at positions 1, 2, 3, the remaining ring would not be symmetrical. positions 4 and 6 would be adjacent to the oh and cl, perhaps. but this is getting too complicated. alternatively, maybe the molecule is not an aldehyde. let's check option a and b again.
options a and b are chlorobenzoic acids (para and ortho). the molecular formula fits the mass spec. the ir shows carboxylic acid o-h (broad) and carbonyl at 1720 (which is a bit high for a carboxylic acid but possible). wait, maybe the carbonyl is part of another group. wait, benzoic acid would have a cooh group. the carbonyl would be at ~1700 cm^-1. the 1720 cm^-1 here might suggest an ester or other group. if the compound is an ester of benzoic acid, then the carbonyl would be at ~1720 cm^-1. but options a and b are benzoic acids (with cooh), not esters. therefore, the 1720 cm^-1 might not fit. however, maybe the instrument's calibration or solvent effects. alternatively, could the compound be a different acid? for example, if it's a chloroformate (option c), which we eliminated due to o-h. alternatively, maybe the compound is a sulfonic acid, but none of the options are that.
wait, another thought: could the compound be phenyl chloroacetate or something else? but none of the options. wait, the options are a) 4-cl benzoic acid, b) 2-cl benzoic acid, c) phenyl chloroformate, d) 3-cl-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde.
let's look at the nmr again. the nmr shows 11.0 ppm (s, 1h), which could be a cooh group or an aldehyde. but aldehydes typically are more reactive and the proton is around 9-10 ppm. 11.0 is higher. maybe a carboxylic acid. but if it's benzoic acid, why is the cooh proton a singlet? benzoic acid's proton is exchange broadened due to acidity. in nmr, it would usually be a broad singlet. but here, the entry says 11.0 ppm (s, 1h), which might indicate that. so maybe that's the cooh proton.
then the aromatic protons: 8.02 ppm (d, 2h) and 7.72 (d, 2h). that suggests two doublets in the aromatic region. in a para-substituted benzoic acid (option a), the aromatic protons邻 to the substituents (cooh and cl) would be shifted. wait, in para nitrobenzoic acid, the protons ortho to the nitro group are deshielded. similarly, in para chlorobenzoic acid, the protons ortho to the cl (and adjacent to cooh) would be deshielded. let's say in para chlorobenzoic acid (option a), the substituents are at positions 1 (cooh) and 4 (cl). then the protons at positions 2 and 6 (ortho to cooh) and positions 3 and 5 (ortho to cl). wait, but those positions would have different shielding. alternatively, maybe the doublets at 8.02 and 7.72 correspond to two pairs of equivalent protons. for example, if the substituents are in para, then positions 2 and 6 (ortho to cooh) would be equivalent, each adjacent to the cooh and a cl (if cl is para). wait, but cl is at position 4, so positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to cooh and nothing else (assuming cl is para to cooh). wait, no. if cl is at position 4 and cooh at position 1, then positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to cooh, and positions 3 and 5 are adjacent to cl. in that case, the protons at positions 2 and 6 would be in a similar environment, and the protons at 3 and 5 similarly. but if the substituents are in para, the coupling between these protons would depend on their positions. if the ring is para-substituted, the protons at positions 2 and 6 (ortho to cooh) would be adjacent to each other and would couple as a doublet. similarly, the protons at 3 and 5 (ortho to cl) would couple with each other. however, if the cl is in para to cooh, then positions 2 and 6 have similar environments but split due to neighboring protons. wait, maybe each of these protons (in positions 2,3,5,6) would couple with their neighbors. but in para substitution, let's consider the actual splitting.
wait, in para-dichlorobenzenes, the proton nmr shows multiplets due to coupling. but in this case, if we have substituents at positions 1 and 4 (cooh and cl), the remaining protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. each of these protons is adjacent to two different substituents. however, positions 2 and 6 are equivalent, and positions 3 and 5 are equivalent. each set (positions 2,6 and 3,5) would form doublets. for example, the protons at 2 and 6 (each adjacent to cooh and h) would couple with their neighboring protons. wait, but if the substituents are in para, then each of these protons would have neighboring protons that are equivalent. wait, if you have a para-substituted ring, like cl at position 4 and cooh at position 1, then the protons at positions 2 and 6 would each be adjacent to cooh and h, and the protons at 3 and 5 would each be adjacent to cl and h. however, positions 2 and 6 are equivalent, so their nmr signals would be a doublet of doublets? wait, but if each proton in position 2 couples with position 1 (cooh, but that's a quaternary carbon) and position 3 (which is adjacent). wait, actually, the coupling in aromatic protons is between adjacent protons. so, proton at position 2 would couple with protons at positions 1 (if not substituent), but wait, position 1 is cooh, which is a substituent. wait, no, the coupling is between neighboring protons. for aromatic protons, coupling (j values) are usually between adjacent protons. so, in a benzene ring, each proton couples with the two adjacent protons. if there are substituents, the coupling constants may change, but the pattern depends on the equivalence.
if we have substituents in para positions (1 and 4), then the protons at 2 and 6 are equivalent, each coupled to two equivalent protons (3 and 5, and 1 which is cooh). wait, no. let's think again. if the substituent is cooh at position 1 and cl at position 4. then, the protons at position 2 and 6 are adjacent to cooh and h. each of these protons (position 2 and 6) would couple with the protons at positions 1 (cooh – no proton) and 3. wait, no. wait, in a benzene ring, each proton is adjacent to two others. if we have substituents at positions 1 and 4, then each proton at 2 and 6 is adjacent to substituent cooh (position 1) and proton at 3 or 5. wait, this is getting too complicated. let's take an example. suppose we have para-chlorobenzoic acid. the structure would have cooh at position 1 and cl at position 4. then, the aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. protons at 2 and 6 are equivalent (due to symmetry), and protons at 3 and 5 are also equivalent. each proton at 2 would be adjacent to cooh (position 1, no proton) and proton at 3. similarly, proton at 3 is adjacent to protons at 2 and 4 (cl, no proton). wait, no. if cl is at position 4, then proton at 3 is adjacent to protons at 2 and 4 (but position 4 is cl, which has no proton). therefore, the coupling would be between protons at positions 2 and 3, and between protons at 3 and 5, etc. wait, perhaps each equivalent proton (e.g., positions 2 and 6) would couple with their neighboring protons (positions 3 and 5). since positions 3 and 5 are equivalent, each proton at 2 and 6 would couple with two equivalent protons (3 and 5), leading to a doublet. similarly, the protons at 3 and 5 would couple with protons at 2 and 4. but position 4 is cl, so no proton. therefore, each proton at 3 would couple with protons at 2 and 5. but if the structure is symmetric, maybe the protons at 2 and 6 are each coupled to two equivalent protons (3 and 5), leading to a doublet. similarly, the protons at 3 and 5 are each coupled to two equivalent protons (2 and 6), leading to a doublet. therefore, in total, you would have two doublets: one for positions 2 and 6, and another for positions 3 and 5. however, due to the different chemical environments (next to cooh and cl), their chemical shifts would be different. if the cooh is at position 1, the protons at 2 and 6 are adjacent to cooh, so they would be more deshielded, hence upfield or downfield? carboxylic acid groups are electron-withdrawing. therefore, protonsortho to cooh are deshielded (higher ppm). similarly, cl is also electron-withdrawing. therefore, the protons ortho to cl (positions 3 and 5) would also be deshielded. but depending on the strength, maybe the cooh effect is stronger. so, the doublets for positions 2 and 6 (ortho to cooh) might be at a higher ppm than positions 3 and 5 (ortho to cl). wait, but in the nmr data, the signals are at 8.02 ppm (d, 2h) and 7.72 (d, 2h). chlorine is meta to cooh in this case. wait, no, if cl is para to cooh, then the positions ortho to cl would be positions 3 and 5. the question is how these environments affect chemical shift. typically, electron-withdrawing groups increase the chemical shift (upfield or downfield)? for aromatic protons, electron-withdrawing groups deshield the protons (shift upfield? wait, no. wait, deshielded protons appear at higher ppm in downfield. so, electron-withdrawing groups (like cooh and cl) would deshield the adjacent protons, moving their nmr signals upfield (higher ppm). therefore, the protons next to stronger electron-withdrawing groups would be at higher ppm. between cooh and cl, cooh is a stronger electron-withdrawer. therefore, the protons ortho to cooh (positions 2 and 6) would be at higher ppm than those ortho to cl (positions 3 and 5). in the nmr data, the signals are at 8.02 ppm (d, 2h) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2h). so, 8.02 is higher than 7.72. therefore, this would correspond to the para substitution with cooh and cl. so, the para substitution (option a) would give two doublets: one at 8.02 (ortho to cooh) and one at 7.72 (ortho to cl). therefore, this structure would fit.
but in ortho substitution (option b, 2-chlorobenzoic acid), the substituents are adjacent. then the nmr splitting would be more complex. for example, if cooh is at position 1 and cl at position 2, the remaining protons would have different coupling patterns. but this is getting too deep into proton nmr of substituted benzenes, which can be complex. however, the key point is that the two doublets in the nmr suggest two pairs of equivalent aromatic protons, each experiencing coupling with their neighbors. this is consistent with a para substitution (where each pair is ortho to a substituent). therefore, option a (4-chlorobenzoic acid) would fit this nmr data.
but wait, the ir shows a broad o-h stretch. if it's benzoic acid (option a or b), that o-h is from the cooh group. however, pure benzoic acid exists as dimer in solution due to hydrogen bonding, and the proton is broad and may be a singlet. in the nmr data, the cooh proton is a singlet at 11.0 ppm. that's possible. so, putting it all together:
- mass spec: m+ at 156, which matches the molecular weight of option a (4-chlorobenzoic acid) or b (2-chlorobenzoic acid).
- ir: broad o-h (from cooh) and carbonyl at 1720 (which is a bit high for cooh but possible).
- nmr: singlet at 11.0 ppm (cooh proton), and two doublets from aromatic protons. the doublets at 8.02 and 7.72 would fit a para-substituted arene (a), whereas an ortho substituent (b) would likely cause more splitting or different chemical shifts.
however, another point: if the chlorobenzoic acid is in the ortho position (b), the two substituents (cooh and cl) are adjacent, which could lead to dihedral angles that might affect the nmr splitting. but i'm not an nmr expert. alternatively, maybe the splitting is different. let's think again.
in para chlorobenzoic acid (a), the two substituents are at positions 1 and 4. the protons at positions 2 and 6 are equivalent and each adjacent to cooh and h. the protons at 3 and 5 are equivalent and adjacent to cl and h. each set would see two equivalent neighboring protons, leading to doublets. the chemical shifts split as 8.02 and 7.72, which is reasonable for electron withdrawal by cooh and cl.
in ortho chlorobenzoic acid (b), substituents at 1 and 2. the remaining aromatic protons would be at positions 3, 4, 5, 6. protons at 3 and 5 (meta to cooh) and protons at 4 and 6 (adjacent to cl and cooh). this would lead to more complicated splitting or potentially multiplets, not clean doublets. therefore, the nmr data with two doublets suggests para substitution (option a).
another point: the mass spectrum shows m+ at 156 and m+2 at 158 (32%). this matches the chlorine isotopes (35cl and 37cl). the molecular ion of 156 (calculated as c7h5o2cl: 156.5) is consistent with option a. therefore, considering all data (mass spec, ir, nmr), option a, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, seems the most reasonable.
let's check option d again. 3-chloro-2-hydroxyben
