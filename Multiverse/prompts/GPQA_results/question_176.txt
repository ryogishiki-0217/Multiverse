Okay, so I need to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let's see, the problem is about finding the probability of getting a specific sequence of measurement outcomes for two observables, P and Q, in a given state. The steps involved here are: first, measuring observable P, getting the result 0, then measuring observable Q, and getting the result -1. I need to find the probability of this sequence happening.
Let's think in parallel.

First, when you measure an observable, the system collapses into one of the eigenstates of that observable, corresponding to the eigenvalue you measured. So, the process is: 1. Start with the given state vector. 2. Measure observable P. We want the outcome 0. So, the system collapses to the eigenstate of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0. 3. Then, measure observable Q on this collapsed state, and we want the outcome -1. So, the probability is the product of two probabilities: the probability of getting 0 when measuring P, and then the probability of getting -1 when measuring Q on the post-measurement state of P. So, let's break this down. First step: Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix P. Then, identify the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Then, find the projection of the initial state onto this eigenspace. The probability of getting 0 when measuring P is the squared norm of this projection divided by the norm squared of the original state (but since the state is a ket vector, normalization comes into play).
Wait, actually, the state given is a vector, but is it normalized? Let's check. Compute the norm squared of the state vector: ||ψ||2 = (-1)2 + 22 + 12 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. So, the norm is sqrt(6). So, the state is not normalized. So, in quantum mechanics, the probabilities are calculated using the squared components of the state vector, but since this vector isn't normalized, we have to take that into account. Wait, actually, no. The probability is given by the square of the absolute value of the coefficient in the expansion in eigenstates, divided by the norm squared if the vector isn't normalized. Hmm. But maybe it's better to normalize the state first.

1: The state vector |ψ⟩ = [-1; 2; 1] has a norm of √6. The normalized state vector is |ψ_norm⟩ = [-1/√6; 2/√6; 1/√6]. The first step is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator P. The matrix P is [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]. To find the eigenvalues, the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0 is solved. The characteristic polynomial is computed as det( [[-λ, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, -λ, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, -λ]] ).

<Path>
1.1: The determinant is computed using the first row: (-λ) * det( [[-λ, 1/√2], [1/√2, -λ]] ) - (1/√2) * det( [[1/√2, 1/√2], [0, -λ]] ). The first minor determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) = λ^2 - 1/2. The second minor determinant is (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) = -λ/√2. The determinant is (-λ)(λ^2 - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = -λ^3 + (1/2)λ + (λ/2) = -λ^3 + λ. The characteristic equation is -λ^3 + λ = 0, which factors to -λ(λ^2 - 1) = 0. This equation further factors to -λ(λ - 1)(λ + 1) = 0. The eigenvalues are λ = 0, λ = 1, and λ = -1.

1.2: The characteristic equation is -λ^3 + (3/(2√2)) λ = 0, which factors to λ(-λ^2 + 3/(2√2)) = 0. The eigenvalues are λ = 0, and λ = ±√(3/(2√2)). The term √(3/(2√2)) simplifies to √(3√2)/2, which is approximately 1.080. The eigenvalues are λ = 0, approximately 1.080, and approximately -1.080. The eigenvalue of interest is 0. The eigenvector corresponding to λ=0 is found by solving (P - 0I) |v⟩ = 0, which means solving P|v⟩ = 0.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The determinant of P - λI is -λ^3 + λ, and the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, and -1.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
The eigenvectors for λ=0 are found by solving the system P|v⟩ = 0. The equations derived from P|v⟩ = 0 are: (0)v1 + (1/√2)v2 + 0*v3 = 0, (1/√2)v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2)v3 = 0, 0*v1 + (1/√2)v2 + 0*v3 = 0.
The third equation, (1/√2)v2 = 0, implies v2 = 0.
The first equation, (1/√2)v2 = 0, also implies v2 = 0, which is consistent with the third equation.
The second equation, (1/√2)v1 + (1/√2)v3 = 0, simplifies to v1 + v3 = 0.
This implies v3 = -v1.
The eigenvectors for λ=0 are of the form |v⟩ = [v1; 0; -v1].
The eigenspace for λ=0 is spanned by the vector [1; 0; -1].
A normalized eigenvector for λ=0 is |e0⟩ = [1; 0; -1] / sqrt(2).
The projection of the normalized state |ψ_norm⟩ onto the eigenvector |e0⟩ is calculated.
The inner product ⟨e0 | ψ_norm⟩ is computed as (1/sqrt(2))(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1) = (-1)/sqrt(2) - 1/sqrt(2) = -2/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).
The probability of measuring P=0 is |⟨e0 | ψ_norm⟩|^2 = |-sqrt(2)|^2 = 2.
The state after the measurement is |e0⟩, and the probability of then measuring Q=-1 is |⟨q=-1 | e0⟩|^2.
The eigenvectors of Q are determined.
The operator Q is diagonal with entries 1, 0, -1.
The eigenvectors of Q are the standard basis vectors |1⟩ = [1;0;0], |2⟩ = [0;1;0], and |3⟩ = [0;0;1].
The eigenvalue of Q for |1⟩ is 1, for |2⟩ is 0, and for |3⟩ is -1.
The eigenvector for Q=-1 is |3⟩ = [0;0;1].
The projection of |e0⟩ onto |3⟩ is computed as ⟨3 | e0⟩ = 0*1 + 0*0 + 1*(-1)/sqrt(2) = -1/sqrt(2).
The probability of measuring Q=-1 after P=0 is |⟨3 | e0⟩|^2 = (-1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.
The combined probability for the sequence P=0 followed by Q=-1 is the product of the individual probabilities: 2 * 1/2 = 1.
This result of 1 is physically impossible for probabilities.

<Path>
2: The probability calculation can be performed directly using the unnormalized state vector, with the probability of a measurement outcome being the squared magnitude of the projection onto the corresponding eigenspace, divided by the squared norm of the state vector. The norm squared of the state vector |ψ⟩ = [-1; 2; 1] is calculated as ||ψ||^2 = (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The probability of obtaining P=0 and then Q=-1 is 1 when the state is normalized, while it is 1/3 when the state is considered unnormalized, using the formula |⟨e0 | ψ⟩|^2 * |⟨q=-1 | e0⟩|^2.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Wait, the problem is that when you compute probabilities in quantum mechanics, even with unnormalized states, the probabilities must be calculated by taking the squared modulus of the projection divided by the squared norm of the state. So, when the state is not normalized, the total probability can be more than 1, but in the context of this problem, we have to consider the Born rule properly. The Born rule states that the probability of outcome λ for an observable O is ||P_λ ψ||2 / ||ψ||2, where P_λ is the projection onto the λ eigenspace of O. So, applying that here: First, the probability of getting P=0 is ||P_{0} ψ||2 / ||ψ||2. Then, after the measurement, the state collapses to P_{0} ψ / ||P_{0} ψ||. Then, the probability of getting Q=-1 is ||P_{-1} P_{0} ψ||2 / ||P_{0} ψ||2. But since we want the total probability of the sequence P=0 followed by Q=-1, it's the product of the first probability and the conditional probability: [||P_{0} ψ||2 / ||ψ||2] * [||P_{-1} P_{0} ψ||2 / ||P_{0} ψ||2] = ||P_{-1} P_{0} ψ||2 / ||ψ||2. Wait, yes. Because the first measurement projects the state onto P_{0} ψ with probability ||P_{0} ψ||2 / ||ψ||2, and then the second measurement projects that state onto P_{-1} P_{0} ψ, with probability ||P_{-1} P_{0} ψ||2 / ||P_{0} ψ||2. Multiplying these gives ||P_{-1} P_{0} ψ||2 / ||ψ||2. But since the state ψ here is not normalized, we need to compute these norms. Let's do this step by step. First, find the projection P_{0} ψ. Then compute ||P_{0} ψ||2. Then compute the projection P_{-1} P_{0} ψ and its squared norm. Then divide by ||ψ||2. Given that, let's proceed. First, find the eigenspace of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0. As we found earlier, the eigenvectors for P=0 are spanned by [1; 0; -1]. Let me verify this again. The matrix P is: [ [ 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0 ], [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0] ] To find the eigenvectors for λ=0, solve P v = 0. So, the equations are: 1/sqrt(2) v_2 = 0 (from first component) 1/sqrt(2) v_1 + 1/sqrt(2) v_3 = 0 (from second component) 1/sqrt(2) v_2 = 0 (from third component) From the first and third equations, v_2 = 0. From the second equation, v_1 + v_3 = 0, so v_3 = -v_1. Hence, the eigenvectors are of the form [v_1; 0; -v_1], so spanned by [1; 0; -1]. So, the projection operator P_0 projects onto this eigenspace. So, the matrix of P_0 in the standard basis is the outer product of [1;0;-1] with itself divided by the norm squared of [1;0;-1]. Wait, [1;0;-1] has norm squared 2, so the projection matrix is (1/2) * [1 0 -1]^T [1 0 -1] = (1/2) * [ [1, 0, -1]; [0, 0, 0]; [-1, 0, 1] ]. Wait, actually, the outer product of [1; 0; -1] with itself is: [ [1*1, 1*0, 1*(-1)], [0*1, 0*0, 0*(-1)], [-1*1, -1*0, -1*(-1)] ] = [ [1, 0, -1], [0, 0, 0], [-1, 0, 1] ] And then you divide by the norm squared of the vector, which is 12 + 02 + (-1)2 = 2, so yes, P_0 = (1/2) * [ [1, 0, -1], [0, 0, 0], [-1, 0, 1] ].
Therefore, applying P_0 to the state ψ = [-1; 2; 1], we get: P_0 ψ = (1/2) * [ [1, 0, -1], [0, 0, 0], [-1, 0, 1] ] * [ -1; 2; 1 ] Compute the matrix-vector product first: First component: 1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1 = -1 + 0 - 1 = -2. Second component: 0*(-1) + 0*2 + 0*1 = 0. Third component: -1*(-1) + 0*2 + 1*1 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2. So, the result is [ -2; 0; 2 ] multiplied by 1/2, which is [ -1; 0; 1 ]. Therefore, P_0 ψ = [ -1; 0; 1 ]. Now, compute the squared norm of this vector: ||P_0 ψ||2 = (-1)2 + 02 + 12 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2. The squared norm of the original state ψ is, as we computed before, 6. Therefore, the probability of getting P=0 is ||P_0 ψ||2 / ||ψ||2 = 2 / 6 = 1/3. Okay, so that's the first probability. Now, if we get P=0, the state collapses to P_0 ψ normalized. But since we already projected and have P_0 ψ with norm sqrt(2), the normalized state after measurement is [-1; 0; 1] / sqrt(2). But now we have to measure Q on this state. We want the probability of getting Q=-1. The operator Q has eigenvalue -1 corresponding to the eigenvector [0,0,1]^T (since Q is diagonal with entries 1,0,-1). So, the eigenspace for Q=-1 is the span of [0,0,1]. The projection operator P_{Q=-1} onto this eigenspace is the outer product of [0,0,1] with itself, which is the matrix [ [0,0,0]; [0,0,0]; [0,0,1] ]. So, to find the probability of getting Q=-1 on the post-measurement state, we need to compute the projection of [-1; 0; 1] (which is P_0 ψ) onto the eigenspace of Q=-1, which is the span of the third basis vector |3⟩. Since the state after P measurement is [-1; 0; 1], projecting onto |3⟩ gives the third component, which is 1. But wait, the projection is (using the projection matrix): P_{Q=-1} ( [-1; 0; 1] ) = [0; 0; 1] * [0,0,1] * [-1; 0; 1] = [0; 0; 1] * 1 = [0; 0; 1]. Wait, perhaps more straightforwardly, the projection operator P_{Q=-1} is the matrix with 1 in the (3,3) entry and 0 elsewhere. So, applying this to the vector [-1; 0; 1] gives [0; 0; 1]. The squared norm of this is 1. But to get the probability, we need to divide by the norm squared of the state being projected, which is ||P_0 ψ||2 = 2. Therefore, the probability of getting Q=-1 given the state is P_0 ψ is 12 / 2 = 1/2. Therefore, the total probability is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6. Wait, but some part here might be wrong. Let me check again. Wait, the probability of the first event (P=0) is 1/3. Then, given that first event, the probability of the second event (Q=-1) is computed as follows. The state after first measurement is P_0 ψ normalized. But when calculating the conditional probability, it's the squared norm of P_{Q=-1} applied to the post-P state, divided by the norm of the post-P state. But since in the rules of quantum mechanics, after the first measurement, the state is P_0 ψ normalized. So, the probability of then measuring Q=-1 is |⟨3 | ψ_P⟩|2, where |ψ_P⟩ is the normalized state after P measurement. So, let's do this. The state after P measurement is |ψ_P⟩ = P_0 ψ / ||P_0 ψ|| = [ -1; 0; 1 ] / sqrt(2). The eigenvector for Q=-1 is |3⟩ = [0;0;1]. The inner product ⟨3 | ψ_P⟩ is (0)*(-1/sqrt(2)) + (0)*(0) + (1)*(1/sqrt(2)) = 1/sqrt(2). The squared magnitude is (1/sqrt(2))2 = 1/2. Therefore, the probability of getting Q=-1 given that we had P=0 is 1/2. Therefore, the total probability for the sequence is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6. Therefore, the answer should be C) 1/6. Wait, but let's confirm this step-by-step. Alternative approach: The probability of getting result 0 for P is the squared magnitude of the projection of ψ onto the P=0 eigenspace, divided by ||ψ||2. Then, given that the system is in the P=0 eigenspace, the probability of getting -1 for Q is the squared magnitude of the projection onto the Q=-1 eigenspace within the P=0 eigenspace. Hmm, but Q and P may not commute, so their eigenspaces aren't necessarily orthogonal. Wait, but in this case, the projection onto Q=-1 is just the third component. However, the P=0 eigenspace consists of vectors of the form [a; 0; -a]. The intersection of the P=0 eigenspace with the Q=-1 eigenspace would require the vector to be in both. But the Q=-1 eigenspace is vectors of the form [0, 0, c]^T. So, their intersection is trivial, because [a, 0, -a] can only be [0,0,c] if a=0 and c=0. So, they don't overlap except at zero vector. Therefore, perhaps there's no component in both? But that contradicts our earlier calculation. Wait, but when we project the state [-1;0;1] onto the Q=-1 eigenspace (which is span{[0,0,1]}), the projection is [0;0;1], which is non-zero. So, even though the eigenvectors for P=0 and Q=-1 are different, the projection of the P=0 eigenspace onto Q=-1 can still have components. Wait, the projection is done on the state vector, not on the eigenspace. So, given that after the first measurement, the system is in state [-1;0;1], normalized or not, then projecting onto the Q=-1 eigenvector (third basis vector) would just take the third component. But in this case, the third component is 1. Wait, but if the state after P measurement is [-1;0;1], then the third component is 1, and the norm of the state is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 0 + 1^2 ) = sqrt(2). Therefore, the probability of Q=-1 is (1)^2 / (sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2. So, yes, that's correct. So, the total probability is (1/3)*(1/2) = 1/6. Therefore, the answer is C) 1/6. But just to be thorough, let's verify by another approach. Alternatively, using the formula from quantum mechanics for sequential measurements. If you have two projectors P_0 and P_{-1} for the respective measurements, the probability is Tr(P_0 P_{-1} P_0 |ψ><ψ| ) / ||ψ||2. But maybe I'm mixing something up. Alternatively, the probability can be calculated as <ψ| P_0 |ψ> / ||ψ||2 multiplied by Tr(P_{-1} P_0 |ψ><ψ| ) / <ψ| P_0 |ψ>. But perhaps not, this might be more complicated. Alternatively, since the first measurement is P then Q, the combined probability is the square of the absolute value of the overlap between the state and the combined projectors. Wait, but in any case, perhaps the initial calculation is correct. Let me cross-verify. Original state: ψ = [-1; 2; 1]. P_0 ψ = [ -1; 0; 1 ], as we found. Then, the probability for P=0 is ||P_0 ψ||2 / ||ψ||2 = 2/6 = 1/3. Then, the post-measurement state is P_0 ψ normalized, i.e., divided by sqrt(2). Then, the probability of Q=-1 is |third component of normalized vector|2, which is (1/sqrt(2))2 = 1/2. So total probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6. So that's correct. Alternatively, another way: the probability of the combined event is the inner product of the state with the operator P_0 P_{-1} P_0 applied to the state. Wait, in quantum mechanics, when you perform a sequential projective measurements, the total probability is given by the Hilbert-Schmidt product: Tr( P_{-1} P_0 |ψ><ψ| P_0 ) ) / ||ψ||2. But perhaps this is overcomplicating. Alternatively, the formula is [ <ψ| P_0 |ψ> ] * [ Tr( P_{-1} P_0 |ψ><ψ| ) / <ψ| P_0 |ψ> ] and that simplifies to Tr( P_{-1} P_0 |ψ><ψ| ). But perhaps not. Alternatively, think of it as the probability amplitude. But maybe not necessary here. Given all that, the step-by-step approach seems solid, giving 1/6.
the final answer is \boxed{C}
</Think>

Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability of measuring \(0\) for observable \(P\) followed by \(-1\) for observable \(Q\).

1. **State Vector and Norm**:
   The state vector is \(\psi = \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\). The norm squared of \(\psi\) is:
   \[
   \|\psi\|^2 = (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6
   \]

2. **Projection onto \(P = 0\) Eigenspace**:
   The eigenvectors of \(P\) corresponding to eigenvalue \(0\) are spanned by \(\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}\). The projection operator \(P_0\) is:
   \[
   P_0 = \frac{1}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ -1 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}
   \]
   Applying \(P_0\) to \(\psi\):
   \[
   P_0 \psi = \frac{1}{2} \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 0 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
   \]
   The norm squared of \(P_0 \psi\) is:
   \[
   \|P_0 \psi\|^2 = (-1)^2 + 0^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2
   \]
   The probability of measuring \(0\) for \(P\) is:
   \[
   \frac{\|P_0 \psi\|^2}{\|\psi\|^2} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]

3. **Projection onto \(Q = -1\) Eigenspace**:
   The eigenvector of \(Q\) corresponding to eigenvalue \(-1\) is \(\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\). The projection operator \(P_{-1}\) is:
   \[
   P_{-1} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}
   \]
   Applying \(P_{-1}\) to the normalized state after measuring \(P = 0\) (which is \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\)):
   \[
   P_{-1} \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
   \]
   The probability of measuring \(-1\) for \(Q\) given \(P = 0\) is:
   \[
   \left\| P_{-1} \left( \frac{P_0 \psi}{\|P_0 \psi\|} \right) \right\|^2 = \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}
   \]

4. **Combined Probability**:
   The total probability is the product of the two probabilities:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}
   \]

The final answer is \boxed{C}.

okay, so i need to solve this quantum mechanics problem. let's see, the problem is about finding the probability of getting a specific sequence of measurement outcomes for two observables, p and q, in a given state. the steps involved here are: first, measuring observable p, getting the result 0, then measuring observable q, and getting the result -1. i need to find the probability of this sequence happening.
let's think in parallel.

2: the operator p is represented by a 3x3 matrix, with the first row containing (0, 1/√2, 0), the second row (1/√2, 0, 1/√2), and the third row (0, 1/√2, 0).

the system's state vector is |ψ⟩ = [-1; 2; 1], the matrix for p is [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]], and the matrix for q is [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]].

first, when you measure an observable, the system collapses into one of the eigenstates of that observable, corresponding to the eigenvalue you measured. so, the process is: 1. start with the given state vector. 2. measure observable p. we want the outcome 0. so, the system collapses to the eigenstate of p corresponding to eigenvalue 0. 3. then, measure observable q on this collapsed state, and we want the outcome -1. so, the probability is the product of two probabilities: the probability of getting 0 when measuring p, and then the probability of getting -1 when measuring q on the post-measurement state of p. so, let's break this down. first step: find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix p. then, identify the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalue 0. then, find the projection of the initial state onto this eigenspace. the probability of getting 0 when measuring p is the squared norm of this projection divided by the norm squared of the original state (but since the state is a ket vector, normalization comes into play).
wait, actually, the state given is a vector, but is it normalized? let's check. compute the norm squared of the state vector: ||ψ||2 = (-1)2 + 22 + 12 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. so, the norm is sqrt(6). so, the state is not normalized. so, in quantum mechanics, the probabilities are calculated using the squared components of the state vector, but since this vector isn't normalized, we have to take that into account. wait, actually, no. the probability is given by the square of the absolute value of the coefficient in the expansion in eigenstates, divided by the norm squared if the vector isn't normalized. hmm. but maybe it's better to normalize the state first.

1: the state vector |ψ⟩ = [-1; 2; 1] has a norm of √6. the normalized state vector is |ψ_norm⟩ = [-1/√6; 2/√6; 1/√6]. the first step is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator p. the matrix p is [[0, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, 0, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, 0]]. to find the eigenvalues, the characteristic equation det(p - λi) = 0 is solved. the characteristic polynomial is computed as det( [[-λ, 1/√2, 0], [1/√2, -λ, 1/√2], [0, 1/√2, -λ]] ).

1.1: the determinant is computed using the first row: (-λ) * det( [[-λ, 1/√2], [1/√2, -λ]] ) - (1/√2) * det( [[1/√2, 1/√2], [0, -λ]] ). the first minor determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) = λ^2 - 1/2. the second minor determinant is (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) = -λ/√2. the determinant is (-λ)(λ^2 - 1/2) - (1/√2)(-λ/√2) = -λ^3 + (1/2)λ + (λ/2) = -λ^3 + λ. the characteristic equation is -λ^3 + λ = 0, which factors to -λ(λ^2 - 1) = 0. this equation further factors to -λ(λ - 1)(λ + 1) = 0. the eigenvalues are λ = 0, λ = 1, and λ = -1.
</path>
<path>
1.2: the characteristic equation is -λ^3 + (3/(2√2)) λ = 0, which factors to λ(-λ^2 + 3/(2√2)) = 0. the eigenvalues are λ = 0, and λ = ±√(3/(2√2)). the term √(3/(2√2)) simplifies to √(3√2)/2, which is approximately 1.080. the eigenvalues are λ = 0, approximately 1.080, and approximately -1.080. the eigenvalue of interest is 0. the eigenvector corresponding to λ=0 is found by solving (p - 0i) |v⟩ = 0, which means solving p|v⟩ = 0.
</path>
<conclusion>
the determinant of p - λi is -λ^3 + λ, and the eigenvalues of p are 0, 1, and -1.

the eigenvectors for λ=0 are found by solving the system p|v⟩ = 0. the equations derived from p|v⟩ = 0 are: (0)v1 + (1/√2)v2 + 0*v3 = 0, (1/√2)v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2)v3 = 0, 0*v1 + (1/√2)v2 + 0*v3 = 0.
the third equation, (1/√2)v2 = 0, implies v2 = 0.
the first equation, (1/√2)v2 = 0, also implies v2 = 0, which is consistent with the third equation.
the second equation, (1/√2)v1 + (1/√2)v3 = 0, simplifies to v1 + v3 = 0.
this implies v3 = -v1.
the eigenvectors for λ=0 are of the form |v⟩ = [v1; 0; -v1].
the eigenspace for λ=0 is spanned by the vector [1; 0; -1].
a normalized eigenvector for λ=0 is |e0⟩ = [1; 0; -1] / sqrt(2).
the projection of the normalized state |ψ_norm⟩ onto the eigenvector |e0⟩ is calculated.
the inner product ⟨e0 | ψ_norm⟩ is computed as (1/sqrt(2))(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1) = (-1)/sqrt(2) - 1/sqrt(2) = -2/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).
the probability of measuring p=0 is |⟨e0 | ψ_norm⟩|^2 = |-sqrt(2)|^2 = 2.
the state after the measurement is |e0⟩, and the probability of then measuring q=-1 is |⟨q=-1 | e0⟩|^2.
the eigenvectors of q are determined.
the operator q is diagonal with entries 1, 0, -1.
the eigenvectors of q are the standard basis vectors |1⟩ = [1;0;0], |2⟩ = [0;1;0], and |3⟩ = [0;0;1].
the eigenvalue of q for |1⟩ is 1, for |2⟩ is 0, and for |3⟩ is -1.
the eigenvector for q=-1 is |3⟩ = [0;0;1].
the projection of |e0⟩ onto |3⟩ is computed as ⟨3 | e0⟩ = 0*1 + 0*0 + 1*(-1)/sqrt(2) = -1/sqrt(2).
the probability of measuring q=-1 after p=0 is |⟨3 | e0⟩|^2 = (-1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.
the combined probability for the sequence p=0 followed by q=-1 is the product of the individual probabilities: 2 * 1/2 = 1.
this result of 1 is physically impossible for probabilities.

2: the probability calculation can be performed directly using the unnormalized state vector, with the probability of a measurement outcome being the squared magnitude of the projection onto the corresponding eigenspace, divided by the squared norm of the state vector. the norm squared of the state vector |ψ⟩ = [-1; 2; 1] is calculated as ||ψ||^2 = (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6.
</path>
<conclusion>
the probability of obtaining p=0 and then q=-1 is 1 when the state is normalized, while it is 1/3 when the state is considered unnormalized, using the formula |⟨e0 | ψ⟩|^2 * |⟨q=-1 | e0⟩|^2.

wait, the problem is that when you compute probabilities in quantum mechanics, even with unnormalized states, the probabilities must be calculated by taking the squared modulus of the projection divided by the squared norm of the state. so, when the state is not normalized, the total probability can be more than 1, but in the context of this problem, we have to consider the born rule properly. the born rule states that the probability of outcome λ for an observable o is ||p_λ ψ||2 / ||ψ||2, where p_λ is the projection onto the λ eigenspace of o. so, applying that here: first, the probability of getting p=0 is ||p_{0} ψ||2 / ||ψ||2. then, after the measurement, the state collapses to p_{0} ψ / ||p_{0} ψ||. then, the probability of getting q=-1 is ||p_{-1} p_{0} ψ||2 / ||p_{0} ψ||2. but since we want the total probability of the sequence p=0 followed by q=-1, it's the product of the first probability and the conditional probability: [||p_{0} ψ||2 / ||ψ||2] * [||p_{-1} p_{0} ψ||2 / ||p_{0} ψ||2] = ||p_{-1} p_{0} ψ||2 / ||ψ||2. wait, yes. because the first measurement projects the state onto p_{0} ψ with probability ||p_{0} ψ||2 / ||ψ||2, and then the second measurement projects that state onto p_{-1} p_{0} ψ, with probability ||p_{-1} p_{0} ψ||2 / ||p_{0} ψ||2. multiplying these gives ||p_{-1} p_{0} ψ||2 / ||ψ||2. but since the state ψ here is not normalized, we need to compute these norms. let's do this step by step. first, find the projection p_{0} ψ. then compute ||p_{0} ψ||2. then compute the projection p_{-1} p_{0} ψ and its squared norm. then divide by ||ψ||2. given that, let's proceed. first, find the eigenspace of p corresponding to eigenvalue 0. as we found earlier, the eigenvectors for p=0 are spanned by [1; 0; -1]. let me verify this again. the matrix p is: [ [ 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0 ], [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0] ] to find the eigenvectors for λ=0, solve p v = 0. so, the equations are: 1/sqrt(2) v_2 = 0 (from first component) 1/sqrt(2) v_1 + 1/sqrt(2) v_3 = 0 (from second component) 1/sqrt(2) v_2 = 0 (from third component) from the first and third equations, v_2 = 0. from the second equation, v_1 + v_3 = 0, so v_3 = -v_1. hence, the eigenvectors are of the form [v_1; 0; -v_1], so spanned by [1; 0; -1]. so, the projection operator p_0 projects onto this eigenspace. so, the matrix of p_0 in the standard basis is the outer product of [1;0;-1] with itself divided by the norm squared of [1;0;-1]. wait, [1;0;-1] has norm squared 2, so the projection matrix is (1/2) * [1 0 -1]^t [1 0 -1] = (1/2) * [ [1, 0, -1]; [0, 0, 0]; [-1, 0, 1] ]. wait, actually, the outer product of [1; 0; -1] with itself is: [ [1*1, 1*0, 1*(-1)], [0*1, 0*0, 0*(-1)], [-1*1, -1*0, -1*(-1)] ] = [ [1, 0, -1], [0, 0, 0], [-1, 0, 1] ] and then you divide by the norm squared of the vector, which is 12 + 02 + (-1)2 = 2, so yes, p_0 = (1/2) * [ [1, 0, -1], [0, 0, 0], [-1, 0, 1] ].
therefore, applying p_0 to the state ψ = [-1; 2; 1], we get: p_0 ψ = (1/2) * [ [1, 0, -1], [0, 0, 0], [-1, 0, 1] ] * [ -1; 2; 1 ] compute the matrix-vector product first: first component: 1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1 = -1 + 0 - 1 = -2. second component: 0*(-1) + 0*2 + 0*1 = 0. third component: -1*(-1) + 0*2 + 1*1 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2. so, the result is [ -2; 0; 2 ] multiplied by 1/2, which is [ -1; 0; 1 ]. therefore, p_0 ψ = [ -1; 0; 1 ]. now, compute the squared norm of this vector: ||p_0 ψ||2 = (-1)2 + 02 + 12 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2. the squared norm of the original state ψ is, as we computed before, 6. therefore, the probability of getting p=0 is ||p_0 ψ||2 / ||ψ||2 = 2 / 6 = 1/3. okay, so that's the first probability. now, if we get p=0, the state collapses to p_0 ψ normalized. but since we already projected and have p_0 ψ with norm sqrt(2), the normalized state after measurement is [-1; 0; 1] / sqrt(2). but now we have to measure q on this state. we want the probability of getting q=-1. the operator q has eigenvalue -1 corresponding to the eigenvector [0,0,1]^t (since q is diagonal with entries 1,0,-1). so, the eigenspace for q=-1 is the span of [0,0,1]. the projection operator p_{q=-1} onto this eigenspace is the outer product of [0,0,1] with itself, which is the matrix [ [0,0,0]; [0,0,0]; [0,0,1] ]. so, to find the probability of getting q=-1 on the post-measurement state, we need to compute the projection of [-1; 0; 1] (which is p_0 ψ) onto the eigenspace of q=-1, which is the span of the third basis vector |3⟩. since the state after p measurement is [-1; 0; 1], projecting onto |3⟩ gives the third component, which is 1. but wait, the projection is (using the projection matrix): p_{q=-1} ( [-1; 0; 1] ) = [0; 0; 1] * [0,0,1] * [-1; 0; 1] = [0; 0; 1] * 1 = [0; 0; 1]. wait, perhaps more straightforwardly, the projection operator p_{q=-1} is the matrix with 1 in the (3,3) entry and 0 elsewhere. so, applying this to the vector [-1; 0; 1] gives [0; 0; 1]. the squared norm of this is 1. but to get the probability, we need to divide by the norm squared of the state being projected, which is ||p_0 ψ||2 = 2. therefore, the probability of getting q=-1 given the state is p_0 ψ is 12 / 2 = 1/2. therefore, the total probability is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6. wait, but some part here might be wrong. let me check again. wait, the probability of the first event (p=0) is 1/3. then, given that first event, the probability of the second event (q=-1) is computed as follows. the state after first measurement is p_0 ψ normalized. but when calculating the conditional probability, it's the squared norm of p_{q=-1} applied to the post-p state, divided by the norm of the post-p state. but since in the rules of quantum mechanics, after the first measurement, the state is p_0 ψ normalized. so, the probability of then measuring q=-1 is |⟨3 | ψ_p⟩|2, where |ψ_p⟩ is the normalized state after p measurement. so, let's do this. the state after p measurement is |ψ_p⟩ = p_0 ψ / ||p_0 ψ|| = [ -1; 0; 1 ] / sqrt(2). the eigenvector for q=-1 is |3⟩ = [0;0;1]. the inner product ⟨3 | ψ_p⟩ is (0)*(-1/sqrt(2)) + (0)*(0) + (1)*(1/sqrt(2)) = 1/sqrt(2). the squared magnitude is (1/sqrt(2))2 = 1/2. therefore, the probability of getting q=-1 given that we had p=0 is 1/2. therefore, the total probability for the sequence is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6. therefore, the answer should be c) 1/6. wait, but let's confirm this step-by-step. alternative approach: the probability of getting result 0 for p is the squared magnitude of the projection of ψ onto the p=0 eigenspace, divided by ||ψ||2. then, given that the system is in the p=0 eigenspace, the probability of getting -1 for q is the squared magnitude of the projection onto the q=-1 eigenspace within the p=0 eigenspace. hmm, but q and p may not commute, so their eigenspaces aren't necessarily orthogonal. wait, but in this case, the projection onto q=-1 is just the third component. however, the p=0 eigenspace consists of vectors of the form [a; 0; -a]. the intersection of the p=0 eigenspace with the q=-1 eigenspace would require the vector to be in both. but the q=-1 eigenspace is vectors of the form [0, 0, c]^t. so, their intersection is trivial, because [a, 0, -a] can only be [0,0,c] if a=0 and c=0. so, they don't overlap except at zero vector. therefore, perhaps there's no component in both? but that contradicts our earlier calculation. wait, but when we project the state [-1;0;1] onto the q=-1 eigenspace (which is span{[0,0,1]}), the projection is [0;0;1], which is non-zero. so, even though the eigenvectors for p=0 and q=-1 are different, the projection of the p=0 eigenspace onto q=-1 can still have components. wait, the projection is done on the state vector, not on the eigenspace. so, given that after the first measurement, the system is in state [-1;0;1], normalized or not, then projecting onto the q=-1 eigenvector (third basis vector) would just take the third component. but in this case, the third component is 1. wait, but if the state after p measurement is [-1;0;1], then the third component is 1, and the norm of the state is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 0 + 1^2 ) = sqrt(2). therefore, the probability of q=-1 is (1)^2 / (sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2. so, yes, that's correct. so, the total probability is (1/3)*(1/2) = 1/6. therefore, the answer is c) 1/6. but just to be thorough, let's verify by another approach. alternatively, using the formula from quantum mechanics for sequential measurements. if you have two projectors p_0 and p_{-1} for the respective measurements, the probability is tr(p_0 p_{-1} p_0 |ψ><ψ| ) / ||ψ||2. but maybe i'm mixing something up. alternatively, the probability can be calculated as <ψ| p_0 |ψ> / ||ψ||2 multiplied by tr(p_{-1} p_0 |ψ><ψ| ) / <ψ| p_0 |ψ>. but perhaps not, this might be more complicated. alternatively, since the first measurement is p then q, the combined probability is the square of the absolute value of the overlap between the state and the combined projectors. wait, but in any case, perhaps the initial calculation is correct. let me cross-verify. original state: ψ = [-1; 2; 1]. p_0 ψ = [ -1; 0; 1 ], as we found. then, the probability for p=0 is ||p_0 ψ||2 / ||ψ||2 = 2/6 = 1/3. then, the post-measurement state is p_0 ψ normalized, i.e., divided by sqrt(2). then, the probability of q=-1 is |third component of normalized vector|2, which is (1/sqrt(2))2 = 1/2. so total probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6. so that's correct. alternatively, another way: the probability of the combined event is the inner product of the state with the operator p_0 p_{-1} p_0 applied to the state. wait, in quantum mechanics, when you perform a sequential projective measurements, the total probability is given by the hilbert-schmidt product: tr( p_{-1} p_0 |ψ><ψ| p_0 ) ) / ||ψ||2. but perhaps this is overcomplicating. alternatively, the formula is [ <ψ| p_0 |ψ> ] * [ tr( p_{-1} p_0 |ψ><ψ| ) / <ψ| p_0 |ψ> ] and that simplifies to tr( p_{-1} p_0 |ψ><ψ| ). but perhaps not. alternatively, think of it as the probability amplitude. but maybe not necessary here. given all that, the step-by-step approach seems solid, giving 1/6.
the final answer is \boxed{c}
</think>

answer: to solve the problem, we need to determine the probability of measuring \(0\) for observable \(p\) followed by \(-1\) for observable \(q\).

1. **state vector and norm**:
   the state vector is \(\psi = \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\). the norm squared of \(\psi\) is:
   \[
   \|\psi\|^2 = (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6
   \]

2. **projection onto \(p = 0\) eigenspace**:
   the eigenvectors of \(p\) corresponding to eigenvalue \(0\) are spanned by \(\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}\). the projection operator \(p_0\) is:
   \[
   p_0 = \frac{1}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ -1 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}
   \]
   applying \(p_0\) to \(\psi\):
   \[
   p_0 \psi = \frac{1}{2} \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 0 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
   \]
   the norm squared of \(p_0 \psi\) is:
   \[
   \|p_0 \psi\|^2 = (-1)^2 + 0^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2
   \]
   the probability of measuring \(0\) for \(p\) is:
   \[
   \frac{\|p_0 \psi\|^2}{\|\psi\|^2} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]

3. **projection onto \(q = -1\) eigenspace**:
   the eigenvector of \(q\) corresponding to eigenvalue \(-1\) is \(\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\). the projection operator \(p_{-1}\) is:
   \[
   p_{-1} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}
   \]
   applying \(p_{-1}\) to the normalized state after measuring \(p = 0\) (which is \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\)):
   \[
   p_{-1} \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
   \]
   the probability of measuring \(-1\) for \(q\) given \(p = 0\) is:
   \[
   \left\| p_{-1} \left( \frac{p_0 \psi}{\|p_0 \psi\|} \right) \right\|^2 = \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}
   \]

4. **combined probability**:
   the total probability is the product of the two probabilities:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}
   \]

the final answer is \boxed{c}
