Okay, so I have this problem here about finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2 using a given metric. The metric is ds2 = 32 / (4 - x2 - y2) (dx2 + dy2). The answer choices are A through D, with A being positive infinity, B being 0, and C and D being expressions involving x2 ± y2. Hmm, let me think.
First, I need to recall what a pseudosphere is. From what I remember, a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative Gaussian curvature. It's like the hyperbolic counterpart to a sphere. The area in this case would probably be computed using the given metric. Since the question is asking for the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2, I need to figure out how the metric relates to the radius.
The metric given is in terms of x and y coordinates, with the denominator 4 - x2 - y2. The radius r=2 must correspond to some boundary in the x-y plane. If the pseudosphere is embedded in a higher-dimensional space, but here it's represented in terms of x and y coordinates, maybe the radius relates to the maximum distance where the metric is defined. The denominator 4 - x2 - y2 would go to zero when x2 + y2 = 4. So that suggests that the metric is defined within the circle of radius 2 in the x-y plane. Therefore, the region where the metric is valid is x2 + y2 < 4, which corresponds to the radius 2. So the area we need to compute is the entire area within this radius where the metric is defined.
To compute the area, we need to integrate the area element given by the metric over the entire region. The area element in a metric ds2 = g_{xx} dx2 + g_{yy} dy2 (assuming diagonal metric and orthogonal coordinates) is sqrt(det(g)) dx dy. Here, the metric is diagonal with g_{xx} = g_{yy} = 32 / (4 - x2 - y2). So the determinant of the metric tensor would be (32 / (4 - x2 - y2))^2, and the square root of that is 32 / (4 - x2 - y2). Therefore, the area element is 32 / (4 - x2 - y2) dx dy.
Thus, the total area is the double integral over the entire x-y plane (but the metric is only defined within x2 + y2 < 4) of 32 / (4 - x2 - y2) dx dy. Wait, but integrating over x2 + y2 < 4. So the region of integration is a circle of radius 2. Let me set up the integral:
A = ∫∫_{x2 + y2 < 4} [32 / (4 - x2 - y2)] dx dy.
Hmm, this integral might be simplified by switching to polar coordinates. Let's let x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, so that x2 + y2 = r2, and dx dy = r dr dθ. The integral becomes:
A = ∫_{0}^{2π} ∫_{0}^{2} [32 / (4 - r2)] r dr dθ.
Let me verify that substitution. Yes, in polar coordinates, the area element is r dr dθ, and here the integrand is 32 / (4 - r2) because x2 + y2 = r2. So the integral is set up correctly.
First, we can factor out the constants. 32 can be factored out, and the integral over θ is from 0 to 2π, so that factor is 2π. So the area becomes:
A = 32 * 2π ∫_{0}^{2} [r / (4 - r2)] dr.
Wait, so 32 times 2π. Let me see: the 32 is from the metric, then integrating over θ gives 2π. So then the remaining integral over r from 0 to 2 of [r / (4 - r2)] dr.
Let me compute that integral. Let u = 4 - r2, then du = -2r dr, so that r dr = - (1/2) du.
When r = 0, u = 4; when r = 2, u = 0. So the integral becomes:
∫_{0}^{2} [r / (4 - r2)] dr = ∫_{4}^{0} [ - (1/2) / u ] du = (1/2) ∫_{0}^{4} (1/u) du.
Which is (1/2) * [ln u] from 0 to 4. Wait, but ln u from 0 to 4 is ln 4 - ln 0, but ln 0 is undefined, approaching negative infinity. However, we have to be careful here. Wait, the integral ∫ (1/u) du is ln |u| + C. So integrating from 0 to 4, but if we approach the lower limit as a limit as ε approaches 0 from above:
lim_{ε→0+} (1/2) [ln(4) - ln(ε)] = (1/2) [ln(4) - (-infty)] = infinity.
So the integral diverges. Therefore, the area A is 32 * 2π * ∞, which is infinity. Therefore, the area is infinite. So the answer is A) +∞.
Wait, but wait. Let me check again. The metric is given as ds2 = 32/(4 - x2 - y2) (dx2 + dy2). So in the area element, we have sqrt(det(g)) = 32/(4 - x2 - y2). Therefore, the integrand is 32/(4 - x2 - y2) over the region x2 + y2 < 4. When we switch to polar coordinates, the integral becomes 32*2π ∫02 [r / (4 - r2)] dr. As we substitute u = 4 - r2, the integral becomes (1/2) ∫_{0}^{4} (1/u) du, which is (1/2)[ln u] from 4 to 0, which is (1/2)[ln 4 - ln 0]. Since ln 0 approaches -infinity, the integral diverges to positive infinity. Therefore, the entire area A is 32 * 2π * infinity = infinity. Therefore, the answer is A) +∞.
But wait, let me double-check. The radius of the pseudosphere is given as r=2. In the metric, the denominator is 4 - x2 - y2, which becomes zero at x2 + y2 = 4, so that is indeed the boundary where the metric blows up, so the radius is 2 in terms of the maximum radius in the x-y plane. So integrating all the way up to 2, but as we saw, the integral diverges at r=2 because the integrand behaves like 1/(4 - r2), which near r=2 is like 1/(4 - 4 + something going to zero), so indeed the integral diverges. Therefore, the area is infinite. So answer A.
But looking at the answer choices, the options are A) +\infty, B) 0, C) 4\pi(x^{2}-y^{2}), D) 4\pi(x^{2}+y^{2}). So unless I made a mistake, but the calculation leads to infinity. However, maybe I misunderstood the question. Let me re-read.
"Consider the following metric: ds2 = 32/(4 - x2 - y2)(dx2 + dy2). What is the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2?" The PS note tells me to use LaTeX, but that's for the answer, okay.
Wait, so pseudosphere usually has a specific metric, but here they have given a metric in terms of x and y, and the radius r=2 probably refers to the radius in the pseudosphere's intrinsic geometry. But according to the metric, the line element is ds2 = 32/(4 - x2 - y2) (dx2 + dy2). So if we consider this as a metric on the pseudosphere, embedded in some higher-dimensional space, but parametrized by x and y with x2 + y2 < 4, then the induced metric is this. The radius r=2 would correspond to the maximum allowed radius in the x-y plane. However, when we compute the area using this metric, we need to integrate over the entire disk x2 + y2 < 4, but as shown, the integral diverges due to the singularity at the boundary. Therefore, the area is infinite, so answer A.
Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the coordinate area within x2 + y2 = 4, but under the given metric. Since the metric scales the Euclidean metric by 32/(4 - r2), which goes to infinity as r approaches 2, the area element also blows up, leading to infinite total area.
Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to compute the Gaussian curvature and use the Gauss-Bonnet theorem? Let me consider that. If the pseudosphere has constant Gaussian curvature K, then the Gauss-Bonnet theorem says that the integral of K over the surface equals 2π times the Euler characteristic. But the pseudosphere is a non-compact surface, homeomorphic to a cylinder or something, but I'm not sure. Wait, the pseudosphere is a surface of revolution, a tractricoid, and has constant negative curvature. If the given metric is for a pseudosphere, then maybe it has constant K = -1/8 or something? Let me compute the Gaussian curvature.
Given that the metric is conformally flat: ds2 = Ω2 (dx2 + dy2), where Ω2 = 32/(4 - x2 - y2). The Gaussian curvature for a conformal metric with factor Ω is given by K = - (1/Ω2) Laplacian(ln Ω)). Wait, the formula in 2D for Gaussian curvature when the metric is e^{2λ}(dx2 + dy2) is K = -e^{-2λ} (λ_{xx} + λ_{yy})). Alternatively, if Ω = e^{λ}, then K = -e^{-2λ}(λ_{xx} + λ_{yy}).
Alternatively, maybe easier to use the formula for K in terms of the metric coefficients. For a metric ds2 = E dx2 + 2F dxdy + G dy2, the Gaussian curvature is:
K = ( (EG - F2)(EN - 2FM + GL) ) / (EG - F2)^2 )
But since our metric is diagonal with E = G = 32/(4 - x2 - y2), F = 0. Then the formula simplifies. Let me recall that for a diagonal metric in 2D, K can be computed as (1/√(EG)) [ (∂/∂x)( (G_x)/√(EG) ) + (∂/∂y)( (E_y)/√(EG) ) ]. Wait, I might need to check the exact formula.
Alternatively, since E = G = 32/(4 - r2), where r2 = x2 + y2. Let me switch to polar coordinates. In polar coordinates, the metric becomes ds2 = (32/(4 - r2)) (dr2 + r2 dθ2). So in polar coordinates, the metric components are:
- dr2 coefficient: E = 32/(4 - r2)
- dθ2 coefficient: G = 32/(4 - r2) * r2
Wait, actually, no. Wait, in polar coordinates, dx2 + dy2 becomes dr2 + r2 dθ2. Therefore, the given metric in polar coordinates is:
ds2 = [32/(4 - r2)] (dr2 + r2 dθ2)
So the metric tensor is diagonal with components:
g_{rr} = 32/(4 - r2)
g_{θθ} = 32/(4 - r2) * r2
Thus, to compute the Gaussian curvature, we can use the formula for a surface of revolution. But maybe it's easier to use the general formula for Gaussian curvature in terms of the metric coefficients. For orthogonal coordinates (where the metric is diagonal), the formula for K is:
K = - (1/√(EG)) [ (1/√(EG))_{,xx} + (1/√(EG))_{,yy} ]
Wait, that might not be correct. Let me recall that for a diagonal metric with components g_{11}, g_{22} (in coordinates u^1, u^2), the Gaussian curvature is:
K = - (1/√(g_{11} g_{22})) [ (∂/∂u^1)^2 (sqrt(g_{22}/g_{11})) + (∂/∂u^2)^2 (sqrt(g_{11}/g_{22})) ]
Alternatively, maybe better to use the Christoffel symbols and then Riemann curvature. But maybe it's quicker to compute the Gaussian curvature for this metric.
Alternatively, use the fact that for a surface with metric ds2 = e^{2φ}(dx2 + dy2), the Gaussian curvature is K = -e^{-2φ} (φ_{xx} + φ_{yy}).
But in our case, the metric isn't quite in that form globally, but in the given coordinates, it is conformal to the Euclidean metric with conformal factor Ω2 = 32/(4 - x2 - y2). So let's write the metric as Ω2 (dx2 + dy2), where Ω2 = 32/(4 - x2 - y2). Then the Gaussian curvature for a conformal metric is given by K = - (Δ ln Ω) / Ω2, where Δ is the Euclidean Laplacian.
So first compute ln Ω. Since Ω2 = 32/(4 - x2 - y2), then Ω = sqrt(32)/(sqrt(4 - x2 - y2)) = sqrt(32)/(sqrt(4 - r2)) where r2 = x2 + y2. Therefore, ln Ω = (1/2) ln 32 - (1/2) ln (4 - r2).
Then compute the Laplacian of ln Ω:
Δ ln Ω = ∂_{x}^2 ln Ω + ∂_{y}^2 ln Ω.
Let's compute this. Since ln Ω depends only on r, so we can write:
Δ ln Ω = (d2/dr2 + (1/r) d/dr)) [ - (1/2) ln(4 - r2) + (1/2) ln 32 ]
Wait, ln Ω = (1/2)(ln 32) - (1/2) ln (4 - r2). The derivative of ln Ω with respect to r is:
d/dr ln Ω = 0 - (1/2)*(1/(4 - r2))*(-2r) ) = (r)/(2(4 - r2))
Then the second derivative is d2/dr2 ln Ω = [ (4 - r2)*1 - r*(-2r) ] / (4 - r2)^2 ) * (1/2) ?
Wait, wait. Let me compute d/dr [ r / (2(4 - r2)) ) ].
Wait, actually, the Laplacian in polar coordinates for a radial function f(r) is Δf = f''(r) + (1/r) f'(r).
So ln Ω is a function of r. So:
Δ ln Ω = d/dr [ (r)/(2(4 - r2)) ) ] + (1/r) [ (r)/(2(4 - r2)) )
Compute the derivative d/dr [ r / (2(4 - r2)) ) ]:
Let me compute that.
Let u = r, v = 2(4 - r2). Then (u/v)' = (u'v - uv') / v2.
u' = 1, v' = -2*2r = -4r.
Therefore:
= [1 * 2(4 - r2) - r*(-4r) ] / [2(4 - r2)]2
= [8 - 2r2 + 4r2] / [4(4 - r2)^2]
= (8 + 2r2) / [4(4 - r2)^2]
= (2(4 + r2)) / [4(4 - r2)^2]
= (4 + r2) / [2(4 - r2)^2]
Then the second term is (1/r)( r / (2(4 - r2)) ) = 1/(2(4 - r2)).
Therefore, Δ ln Ω = (4 + r2)/(2(4 - r2)^2) + 1/(2(4 - r2)) )
Combine the terms over a common denominator:
= [ (4 + r2) + (4 - r2) ] / [2(4 - r2)^2 ]
= (4 + r2 + 4 - r2) / [2(4 - r2)^2 ]
= 8 / [2(4 - r2)^2 ]
= 4 / (4 - r2)^2
Therefore, Δ ln Ω = 4 / (4 - r2)^2.
Then the Gaussian curvature K is - Δ ln Ω / Ω2.
Wait, no: K = - (Δ ln Ω) / Ω2.
Wait, let me recall that for a conformal metric ds2 = e^{2λ} (dx2 + dy2), the Gaussian curvature is K = -e^{-2λ} (λ_{xx} + λ_{yy})). In our case, the metric is Ω2 (dx2 + dy2), so if we set e^{2λ} = Ω2, then λ = ln Ω, so that λ_{xx} + λ_{yy} = Δ ln Ω. Therefore, K = - e^{-2λ} Δ ln Ω = - (1/Ω2) Δ ln Ω.
Therefore, K = - (1 / Ω2) * (4 / (4 - r2)^2 )
But Ω2 = 32/(4 - r2), so 1/Ω2 = (4 - r2)/32.
Therefore, K = - (4 - r2)/32 * 4/(4 - r2)^2 = - 4 / (32(4 - r2)) ) = -1 / (8(4 - r2))
Simplify: -1/(8(4 - r2)).
But let's see. So K = - (4)/(32(4 - r2)^2) * (4 - r2)? Wait, maybe I made a mistake in substitution.
Wait, step by step:
K = - (1/Ω2) * Δ ln Ω.
We have Δ ln Ω = 4 / (4 - r2)^2.
Ω2 = 32 / (4 - r2).
Therefore, 1 / Ω2 = (4 - r2) / 32.
Therefore, K = - ( (4 - r2)/32 ) * (4 / (4 - r2)^2 ) )
Multiply these together:
= - (4 - r2)/32 * 4 / (4 - r2)^2
= -4 / [32(4 - r2)]
= -1 / [8(4 - r2)]
So K = -1 / [8(4 - r2)]
Therefore, the Gaussian curvature is not constant. It depends on r. So this is not a pseudosphere with constant negative curvature. Wait, but the question says "the pseudosphere of radius r=2". Hmm, so maybe it's a different parametrization. But I might have miscalculated here.
Wait, but maybe the term pseudosphere is used here just for this particular surface with this metric, even though its curvature is not constant. But the question is about computing the area. Regardless of the curvature, we proceed to compute the area via integrating the area element, which as previously concluded, leads to a divergent integral. So even if K is variable here, the area integral still diverges, leading to infinity. Therefore, the answer is A) +\infty.
Alternatively, maybe the question is trickier. Maybe the radius r=2 refers to the radius in the intrinsic geometry, not the extrinsic radius in the ambient space. But in that case, how is the metric defined? If the pseudosphere has an intrinsic radius r=2, perhaps the area would be computed as 4π(a^2)(1 - cosh(r)/a) or something? Wait, but I need to recall the formula for the area of a pseudosphere.
Wait, the pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, say K = -1/a2. The area for a pseudosphere of intrinsic radius r (the radius in the intrinsic metric) would be the same as any surface of revolution with that metric. But the standard pseudosphere has infinite area. For example, the tractricoid (standard pseudosphere) has infinite area because it extends to infinity in one direction. However, if we consider a pseudosphere cap with radius r, maybe the area is finite. Wait, but the metric given here is defined on a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane, but with the area element blowing up at the boundary, leading to infinite total area. So in this case, even if the pseudosphere has intrinsic radius r=2, the area would be infinite because the metric causes the area element to diverge.
Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where the answer is 0, but that doesn't make sense. Or maybe the answer is C or D, but those are expressions involving x2 ± y2, which are coordinates-dependent. However, the area should be a numerical value, not depending on coordinates. Therefore, options C and D are likely incorrect because they are not constants but functions of x and y. Therefore, the only plausible answers are A or B. Since the integral diverges, the area is infinite, so A.
Alternatively, perhaps the question is misstated or I misunderstood the term "pseudosphere of radius r=2". Maybe they meant a sphere of radius 2 with some metric, but given the options and the metric provided, which leads to divergence, the answer is A.
Alternatively, perhaps the integral actually converges? Let me check again.
The integral for area is A = 32 * ∫_{0}^{2π} ∫_{0}^{2} [ r / (4 - r2) ] dr dθ.
The inner integral is ∫_{0}^{2} [ r / (4 - r2) ] dr. Let me compute this again.
Let u = 4 - r2, then du = -2r dr => r dr = - (1/2) du.
When r = 0, u = 4; r = 2, u = 0. So:
∫_{0}^{2} [ r / u ] dr = ∫_{4}^{0} ( -1/2 ) [1/u ] du = (1/2) ∫_{0}^{4} [1/u] du.
Which is (1/2) [ ln u ] evaluated from 0 to 4. But ln u as u approaches 0 from the positive side tends to -infinity. Therefore, this integral diverges to +infinity because 1/u tends to infinity as u approaches 0. Therefore, the integral is indeed divergent, so the area is infinite.
Therefore, the answer is A) +\infty.
Therefore, after going through the calculation of the integral and confirming that it diverges, and checking the Gaussian curvature (which isn't constant), the conclusion is that the area is infinite. So the answer is A.
**Final Answer**
\boxed{A}
</Think>

Answer: To determine the area of the pseudosphere with radius \( r = 2 \) using the given metric \( ds^{2} = \frac{32}{4 - x^{2} - y^{2}} (dx^{2} + dy^{2}) \), we need to compute the area integral over the region where the metric is defined. The metric is valid within the circle \( x^{2} + y^{2} < 4 \), corresponding to a radius of 2.

The area element in this metric is given by \( \sqrt{\det(g)} \, dx \, dy \), where the determinant of the metric tensor \( g \) is \( \left( \frac{32}{4 - x^{2} - y^{2}} \right)^{2} \). Thus, the area element simplifies to \( \frac{32}{4 - x^{2} - y^{2}} \, dx \, dy \).

Switching to polar coordinates \( (r, \theta) \) where \( x = r \cos \theta \) and \( y = r \sin \theta \), the area integral becomes:
\[
A = \int_{0}^{2\pi} \int_{0}^{2} \frac{32}{4 - r^{2}} \, r \, dr \, d\theta
\]

The integral over \( \theta \) is straightforward:
\[
A = 32 \times 2\pi \int_{0}^{2} \frac{r}{4 - r^{2}} \, dr
\]

Using the substitution \( u = 4 - r^{2} \), we find \( du = -2r \, dr \), transforming the integral into:
\[
\int_{4}^{0} \frac{-1/2}{u} \, du = \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{4} \frac{1}{u} \, du
\]

This integral evaluates to:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \left[ \ln u \right]_{0}^{4} = \frac{1}{2} (\ln 4 - \lim_{\epsilon \to 0^{+}} \ln \epsilon)
\]

As \( \ln \epsilon \) approaches \(-\infty\) as \( \epsilon \to 0 \), the integral diverges to infinity. Therefore, the total area \( A \) is:
\[
A = 32 \times 2\pi \times \infty = \infty
\]

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \) is \(\boxed{A}\).

okay, so i have this problem here about finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2 using a given metric. the metric is ds2 = 32 / (4 - x2 - y2) (dx2 + dy2). the answer choices are a through d, with a being positive infinity, b being 0, and c and d being expressions involving x2 ± y2. hmm, let me think.
first, i need to recall what a pseudosphere is. from what i remember, a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative gaussian curvature. it's like the hyperbolic counterpart to a sphere. the area in this case would probably be computed using the given metric. since the question is asking for the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2, i need to figure out how the metric relates to the radius.

to compute the area, we need to integrate the area element given by the metric over the entire region. the area element in a metric ds2 = g_{xx} dx2 + g_{yy} dy2 (assuming diagonal metric and orthogonal coordinates) is sqrt(det(g)) dx dy. here, the metric is diagonal with g_{xx} = g_{yy} = 32 / (4 - x2 - y2). so the determinant of the metric tensor would be (32 / (4 - x2 - y2))^2, and the square root of that is 32 / (4 - x2 - y2). therefore, the area element is 32 / (4 - x2 - y2) dx dy.
thus, the total area is the double integral over the entire x-y plane (but the metric is only defined within x2 + y2 < 4) of 32 / (4 - x2 - y2) dx dy. wait, but integrating over x2 + y2 < 4. so the region of integration is a circle of radius 2. let me set up the integral:
a = ∫∫_{x2 + y2 < 4} [32 / (4 - x2 - y2)] dx dy.
hmm, this integral might be simplified by switching to polar coordinates. let's let x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, so that x2 + y2 = r2, and dx dy = r dr dθ. the integral becomes:
a = ∫_{0}^{2π} ∫_{0}^{2} [32 / (4 - r2)] r dr dθ.
let me verify that substitution. yes, in polar coordinates, the area element is r dr dθ, and here the integrand is 32 / (4 - r2) because x2 + y2 = r2. so the integral is set up correctly.
first, we can factor out the constants. 32 can be factored out, and the integral over θ is from 0 to 2π, so that factor is 2π. so the area becomes:
a = 32 * 2π ∫_{0}^{2} [r / (4 - r2)] dr.
wait, so 32 times 2π. let me see: the 32 is from the metric, then integrating over θ gives 2π. so then the remaining integral over r from 0 to 2 of [r / (4 - r2)] dr.
let me compute that integral. let u = 4 - r2, then du = -2r dr, so that r dr = - (1/2) du.
when r = 0, u = 4; when r = 2, u = 0. so the integral becomes:
∫_{0}^{2} [r / (4 - r2)] dr = ∫_{4}^{0} [ - (1/2) / u ] du = (1/2) ∫_{0}^{4} (1/u) du.
which is (1/2) * [ln u] from 0 to 4. wait, but ln u from 0 to 4 is ln 4 - ln 0, but ln 0 is undefined, approaching negative infinity. however, we have to be careful here. wait, the integral ∫ (1/u) du is ln |u| + c. so integrating from 0 to 4, but if we approach the lower limit as a limit as ε approaches 0 from above:
lim_{ε→0+} (1/2) [ln(4) - ln(ε)] = (1/2) [ln(4) - (-infty)] = infinity.
so the integral diverges. therefore, the area a is 32 * 2π * ∞, which is infinity. therefore, the area is infinite. so the answer is a) +∞.
wait, but wait. let me check again. the metric is given as ds2 = 32/(4 - x2 - y2) (dx2 + dy2). so in the area element, we have sqrt(det(g)) = 32/(4 - x2 - y2). therefore, the integrand is 32/(4 - x2 - y2) over the region x2 + y2 < 4. when we switch to polar coordinates, the integral becomes 32*2π ∫02 [r / (4 - r2)] dr. as we substitute u = 4 - r2, the integral becomes (1/2) ∫_{0}^{4} (1/u) du, which is (1/2)[ln u] from 4 to 0, which is (1/2)[ln 4 - ln 0]. since ln 0 approaches -infinity, the integral diverges to positive infinity. therefore, the entire area a is 32 * 2π * infinity = infinity. therefore, the answer is a) +∞.
but wait, let me double-check. the radius of the pseudosphere is given as r=2. in the metric, the denominator is 4 - x2 - y2, which becomes zero at x2 + y2 = 4, so that is indeed the boundary where the metric blows up, so the radius is 2 in terms of the maximum radius in the x-y plane. so integrating all the way up to 2, but as we saw, the integral diverges at r=2 because the integrand behaves like 1/(4 - r2), which near r=2 is like 1/(4 - 4 + something going to zero), so indeed the integral diverges. therefore, the area is infinite. so answer a.
but looking at the answer choices, the options are a) +\infty, b) 0, c) 4\pi(x^{2}-y^{2}), d) 4\pi(x^{2}+y^{2}). so unless i made a mistake, but the calculation leads to infinity. however, maybe i misunderstood the question. let me re-read.
"consider the following metric: ds2 = 32/(4 - x2 - y2)(dx2 + dy2). what is the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2?" the ps note tells me to use latex, but that's for the answer, okay.
wait, so pseudosphere usually has a specific metric, but here they have given a metric in terms of x and y, and the radius r=2 probably refers to the radius in the pseudosphere's intrinsic geometry. but according to the metric, the line element is ds2 = 32/(4 - x2 - y2) (dx2 + dy2). so if we consider this as a metric on the pseudosphere, embedded in some higher-dimensional space, but parametrized by x and y with x2 + y2 < 4, then the induced metric is this. the radius r=2 would correspond to the maximum allowed radius in the x-y plane. however, when we compute the area using this metric, we need to integrate over the entire disk x2 + y2 < 4, but as shown, the integral diverges due to the singularity at the boundary. therefore, the area is infinite, so answer a.
alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the coordinate area within x2 + y2 = 4, but under the given metric. since the metric scales the euclidean metric by 32/(4 - r2), which goes to infinity as r approaches 2, the area element also blows up, leading to infinite total area.
alternatively, maybe i'm supposed to compute the gaussian curvature and use the gauss-bonnet theorem? let me consider that. if the pseudosphere has constant gaussian curvature k, then the gauss-bonnet theorem says that the integral of k over the surface equals 2π times the euler characteristic. but the pseudosphere is a non-compact surface, homeomorphic to a cylinder or something, but i'm not sure. wait, the pseudosphere is a surface of revolution, a tractricoid, and has constant negative curvature. if the given metric is for a pseudosphere, then maybe it has constant k = -1/8 or something? let me compute the gaussian curvature.
given that the metric is conformally flat: ds2 = ω2 (dx2 + dy2), where ω2 = 32/(4 - x2 - y2). the gaussian curvature for a conformal metric with factor ω is given by k = - (1/ω2) laplacian(ln ω)). wait, the formula in 2d for gaussian curvature when the metric is e^{2λ}(dx2 + dy2) is k = -e^{-2λ} (λ_{xx} + λ_{yy})). alternatively, if ω = e^{λ}, then k = -e^{-2λ}(λ_{xx} + λ_{yy}).
alternatively, maybe easier to use the formula for k in terms of the metric coefficients. for a metric ds2 = e dx2 + 2f dxdy + g dy2, the gaussian curvature is:
k = ( (eg - f2)(en - 2fm + gl) ) / (eg - f2)^2 )
but since our metric is diagonal with e = g = 32/(4 - x2 - y2), f = 0. then the formula simplifies. let me recall that for a diagonal metric in 2d, k can be computed as (1/√(eg)) [ (∂/∂x)( (g_x)/√(eg) ) + (∂/∂y)( (e_y)/√(eg) ) ]. wait, i might need to check the exact formula.
alternatively, since e = g = 32/(4 - r2), where r2 = x2 + y2. let me switch to polar coordinates. in polar coordinates, the metric becomes ds2 = (32/(4 - r2)) (dr2 + r2 dθ2). so in polar coordinates, the metric components are:
- dr2 coefficient: e = 32/(4 - r2)
- dθ2 coefficient: g = 32/(4 - r2) * r2
wait, actually, no. wait, in polar coordinates, dx2 + dy2 becomes dr2 + r2 dθ2. therefore, the given metric in polar coordinates is:
ds2 = [32/(4 - r2)] (dr2 + r2 dθ2)
so the metric tensor is diagonal with components:
g_{rr} = 32/(4 - r2)
g_{θθ} = 32/(4 - r2) * r2
thus, to compute the gaussian curvature, we can use the formula for a surface of revolution. but maybe it's easier to use the general formula for gaussian curvature in terms of the metric coefficients. for orthogonal coordinates (where the metric is diagonal), the formula for k is:
k = - (1/√(eg)) [ (1/√(eg))_{,xx} + (1/√(eg))_{,yy} ]
wait, that might not be correct. let me recall that for a diagonal metric with components g_{11}, g_{22} (in coordinates u^1, u^2), the gaussian curvature is:
k = - (1/√(g_{11} g_{22})) [ (∂/∂u^1)^2 (sqrt(g_{22}/g_{11})) + (∂/∂u^2)^2 (sqrt(g_{11}/g_{22})) ]
alternatively, maybe better to use the christoffel symbols and then riemann curvature. but maybe it's quicker to compute the gaussian curvature for this metric.
alternatively, use the fact that for a surface with metric ds2 = e^{2φ}(dx2 + dy2), the gaussian curvature is k = -e^{-2φ} (φ_{xx} + φ_{yy}).
but in our case, the metric isn't quite in that form globally, but in the given coordinates, it is conformal to the euclidean metric with conformal factor ω2 = 32/(4 - x2 - y2). so let's write the metric as ω2 (dx2 + dy2), where ω2 = 32/(4 - x2 - y2). then the gaussian curvature for a conformal metric is given by k = - (δ ln ω) / ω2, where δ is the euclidean laplacian.
so first compute ln ω. since ω2 = 32/(4 - x2 - y2), then ω = sqrt(32)/(sqrt(4 - x2 - y2)) = sqrt(32)/(sqrt(4 - r2)) where r2 = x2 + y2. therefore, ln ω = (1/2) ln 32 - (1/2) ln (4 - r2).
then compute the laplacian of ln ω:
δ ln ω = ∂_{x}^2 ln ω + ∂_{y}^2 ln ω.
let's compute this. since ln ω depends only on r, so we can write:
δ ln ω = (d2/dr2 + (1/r) d/dr)) [ - (1/2) ln(4 - r2) + (1/2) ln 32 ]
wait, ln ω = (1/2)(ln 32) - (1/2) ln (4 - r2). the derivative of ln ω with respect to r is:
d/dr ln ω = 0 - (1/2)*(1/(4 - r2))*(-2r) ) = (r)/(2(4 - r2))
then the second derivative is d2/dr2 ln ω = [ (4 - r2)*1 - r*(-2r) ] / (4 - r2)^2 ) * (1/2) ?
wait, wait. let me compute d/dr [ r / (2(4 - r2)) ) ].
wait, actually, the laplacian in polar coordinates for a radial function f(r) is δf = f''(r) + (1/r) f'(r).
so ln ω is a function of r. so:
δ ln ω = d/dr [ (r)/(2(4 - r2)) ) ] + (1/r) [ (r)/(2(4 - r2)) )
compute the derivative d/dr [ r / (2(4 - r2)) ) ]:
let me compute that.
let u = r, v = 2(4 - r2). then (u/v)' = (u'v - uv') / v2.
u' = 1, v' = -2*2r = -4r.
therefore:
= [1 * 2(4 - r2) - r*(-4r) ] / [2(4 - r2)]2
= [8 - 2r2 + 4r2] / [4(4 - r2)^2]
= (8 + 2r2) / [4(4 - r2)^2]
= (2(4 + r2)) / [4(4 - r2)^2]
= (4 + r2) / [2(4 - r2)^2]
then the second term is (1/r)( r / (2(4 - r2)) ) = 1/(2(4 - r2)).
therefore, δ ln ω = (4 + r2)/(2(4 - r2)^2) + 1/(2(4 - r2)) )
combine the terms over a common denominator:
= [ (4 + r2) + (4 - r2) ] / [2(4 - r2)^2 ]
= (4 + r2 + 4 - r2) / [2(4 - r2)^2 ]
= 8 / [2(4 - r2)^2 ]
= 4 / (4 - r2)^2
therefore, δ ln ω = 4 / (4 - r2)^2.
then the gaussian curvature k is - δ ln ω / ω2.
wait, no: k = - (δ ln ω) / ω2.
wait, let me recall that for a conformal metric ds2 = e^{2λ} (dx2 + dy2), the gaussian curvature is k = -e^{-2λ} (λ_{xx} + λ_{yy})). in our case, the metric is ω2 (dx2 + dy2), so if we set e^{2λ} = ω2, then λ = ln ω, so that λ_{xx} + λ_{yy} = δ ln ω. therefore, k = - e^{-2λ} δ ln ω = - (1/ω2) δ ln ω.
therefore, k = - (1 / ω2) * (4 / (4 - r2)^2 )
but ω2 = 32/(4 - r2), so 1/ω2 = (4 - r2)/32.
therefore, k = - (4 - r2)/32 * 4/(4 - r2)^2 = - 4 / (32(4 - r2)) ) = -1 / (8(4 - r2))
simplify: -1/(8(4 - r2)).
but let's see. so k = - (4)/(32(4 - r2)^2) * (4 - r2)? wait, maybe i made a mistake in substitution.
wait, step by step:
k = - (1/ω2) * δ ln ω.
we have δ ln ω = 4 / (4 - r2)^2.
ω2 = 32 / (4 - r2).
therefore, 1 / ω2 = (4 - r2) / 32.
therefore, k = - ( (4 - r2)/32 ) * (4 / (4 - r2)^2 ) )
multiply these together:
= - (4 - r2)/32 * 4 / (4 - r2)^2
= -4 / [32(4 - r2)]
= -1 / [8(4 - r2)]
so k = -1 / [8(4 - r2)]
therefore, the gaussian curvature is not constant. it depends on r. so this is not a pseudosphere with constant negative curvature. wait, but the question says "the pseudosphere of radius r=2". hmm, so maybe it's a different parametrization. but i might have miscalculated here.
wait, but maybe the term pseudosphere is used here just for this particular surface with this metric, even though its curvature is not constant. but the question is about computing the area. regardless of the curvature, we proceed to compute the area via integrating the area element, which as previously concluded, leads to a divergent integral. so even if k is variable here, the area integral still diverges, leading to infinity. therefore, the answer is a) +\infty.
alternatively, maybe the question is trickier. maybe the radius r=2 refers to the radius in the intrinsic geometry, not the extrinsic radius in the ambient space. but in that case, how is the metric defined? if the pseudosphere has an intrinsic radius r=2, perhaps the area would be computed as 4π(a^2)(1 - cosh(r)/a) or something? wait, but i need to recall the formula for the area of a pseudosphere.
wait, the pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, say k = -1/a2. the area for a pseudosphere of intrinsic radius r (the radius in the intrinsic metric) would be the same as any surface of revolution with that metric. but the standard pseudosphere has infinite area. for example, the tractricoid (standard pseudosphere) has infinite area because it extends to infinity in one direction. however, if we consider a pseudosphere cap with radius r, maybe the area is finite. wait, but the metric given here is defined on a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane, but with the area element blowing up at the boundary, leading to infinite total area. so in this case, even if the pseudosphere has intrinsic radius r=2, the area would be infinite because the metric causes the area element to diverge.
alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where the answer is 0, but that doesn't make sense. or maybe the answer is c or d, but those are expressions involving x2 ± y2, which are coordinates-dependent. however, the area should be a numerical value, not depending on coordinates. therefore, options c and d are likely incorrect because they are not constants but functions of x and y. therefore, the only plausible answers are a or b. since the integral diverges, the area is infinite, so a.
alternatively, perhaps the question is misstated or i misunderstood the term "pseudosphere of radius r=2". maybe they meant a sphere of radius 2 with some metric, but given the options and the metric provided, which leads to divergence, the answer is a.
alternatively, perhaps the integral actually converges? let me check again.
the integral for area is a = 32 * ∫_{0}^{2π} ∫_{0}^{2} [ r / (4 - r2) ] dr dθ.
the inner integral is ∫_{0}^{2} [ r / (4 - r2) ] dr. let me compute this again.
let u = 4 - r2, then du = -2r dr => r dr = - (1/2) du.
when r = 0, u = 4; r = 2, u = 0. so:
∫_{0}^{2} [ r / u ] dr = ∫_{4}^{0} ( -1/2 ) [1/u ] du = (1/2) ∫_{0}^{4} [1/u] du.
which is (1/2) [ ln u ] evaluated from 0 to 4. but ln u as u approaches 0 from the positive side tends to -infinity. therefore, this integral diverges to +infinity because 1/u tends to infinity as u approaches 0. therefore, the integral is indeed divergent, so the area is infinite.
therefore, the answer is a) +\infty.
therefore, after going through the calculation of the integral and confirming that it diverges, and checking the gaussian curvature (which isn't constant), the conclusion is that the area is infinite. so the answer is a.
**final answer**
\boxed{a}
</think>

answer: to determine the area of the pseudosphere with radius \( r = 2 \) using the given metric \( ds^{2} = \frac{32}{4 - x^{2} - y^{2}} (dx^{2} + dy^{2}) \), we need to compute the area integral over the region where the metric is defined. the metric is valid within the circle \( x^{2} + y^{2} < 4 \), corresponding to a radius of 2.

the area element in this metric is given by \( \sqrt{\det(g)} \, dx \, dy \), where the determinant of the metric tensor \( g \) is \( \left( \frac{32}{4 - x^{2} - y^{2}} \right)^{2} \). thus, the area element simplifies to \( \frac{32}{4 - x^{2} - y^{2}} \, dx \, dy \).

switching to polar coordinates \( (r, \theta) \) where \( x = r \cos \theta \) and \( y = r \sin \theta \), the area integral becomes:
\[
a = \int_{0}^{2\pi} \int_{0}^{2} \frac{32}{4 - r^{2}} \, r \, dr \, d\theta
\]

the integral over \( \theta \) is straightforward:
\[
a = 32 \times 2\pi \int_{0}^{2} \frac{r}{4 - r^{2}} \, dr
\]

using the substitution \( u = 4 - r^{2} \), we find \( du = -2r \, dr \), transforming the integral into:
\[
\int_{4}^{0} \frac{-1/2}{u} \, du = \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{4} \frac{1}{u} \, du
\]

this integral evaluates to:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \left[ \ln u \right]_{0}^{4} = \frac{1}{2} (\ln 4 - \lim_{\epsilon \to 0^{+}} \ln \epsilon)
\]

as \( \ln \epsilon \) approaches \(-\infty\) as \( \epsilon \to 0 \), the integral diverges to infinity. therefore, the total area \( a \) is:
\[
a = 32 \times 2\pi \times \infty = \infty
\]

thus, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \) is \(\boxed{a}\)
