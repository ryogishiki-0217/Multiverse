Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about the hydrogen atom and dipole transitions. The question is asking about the decay of a |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions. I need to figure out the correct transition route and the corresponding probability from the given options A, B, C, and D.
First, let me recall some rules about dipole transitions in hydrogen-like atoms.
In the non-relativistic theory, the allowed transitions are those where the principal quantum number n changes, but there are selection rules. The main selection rule for dipole transitions is that the change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number l must be Δl = ±1. Also, the magnetic quantum number m can change by Δm = 0, ±1.
Since the transition is happening in two steps, each step has to follow the Δl = ±1 rule.
Let's think in parallel.

<Path>
1: The initial state is |3,0,0⟩. The first transition must adhere to the selection rule Δl = ±1. The orbital angular momentum quantum number l for the initial state is 0. Applying the rule Δl = ±1 results in possible values of l' for the intermediate state as 0 ± 1, which means l' can be 1 or -1. However, l' must be a non-negative integer, so the only valid possibility is l' = 1. The intermediate state's principal quantum number n' must be less than 3 because the atom is decaying. The possible values for n' are 1 or 2. The final state after the second transition is |1,0,0⟩. The intermediate state must therefore have a principal quantum number n' greater than 1. This condition means n' must be 2. The first transition from |3,0,0⟩ must therefore go to |2,1,m'⟩. The magnetic quantum number m' for the intermediate state must satisfy the selection rule Δm = 0, ±1. The initial m is 0, so m' can be 0, 1, or -1. The intermediate state is thus |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, or |2,1,-1⟩.

1: The second transition from an intermediate state |2,1,0⟩ must follow the selection rule Δl = ±1, leading to a final l'' of 0 or 2. The final state is |1,0,0⟩, which has l'' = 0. For a transition from l' = 1 to l'' = 0, the change Δl'' = -1 satisfies the rule. The transition |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ is therefore allowed. The magnetic quantum number m'' for the final state must satisfy Δm'' = 0, ±1. The initial m' is 0, so m'' can be 0, 1, or -1. The final state has m'' = 0, which is allowed. The transition |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ is permitted. The overall transition route |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ is a possible path. This path corresponds to option C.
</Path>
<Path>
2: If the intermediate state is |2,1,1⟩, the second transition must obey Δl = ±1. The orbital angular momentum quantum number l' for the intermediate state is 1, so l'' for the final state can be 0 or 2. The final state is |1,0,0⟩, which has l''=0. The change Δl = -1 (from l'=1 to l''=0) is allowed. The magnetic quantum number m' for the intermediate state is 1. The final state has m''=0, which requires Δm = -1, satisfying the selection rule. The second transition from |2,1,1⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ is therefore allowed. This path, starting from |3,0,0⟩, transitioning via |2,1,1⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, corresponds to option B.
</Path>
<Path>
3: The final state |1,0,0⟩ has l = 0 and m = 0. The intermediate state for the second transition is |2,1,-1⟩, which has l' = 1 and m' = -1. The second transition must satisfy Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. A transition from l' = 1 to l = 0 requires Δl = -1. The change in magnetic quantum number Δm is m - m' = 0 - (-1) = +1, satisfying the Δm = ±1 rule. This transition is allowed. The route |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ is therefore a possible path.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The second transition from |2,1,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ is allowed, corresponding to option C. The second transition from |2,1,1⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ is allowed, corresponding to option B. The second transition from |2,1,-1⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ is allowed, corresponding to option D.

Similarly, for the second transition from |2,1,1⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, Δl = -1 and Δm = -1, which are allowed. So that path is allowed as well. Similarly, for the transition from |2,1,-1⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, Δl = -1 and Δm = +1 (since m goes from -1 to 0), which is also allowed. So all three intermediate m states (0, 1, -1) can lead to the final state |1,0,0⟩. But now, the question is about the probability of each path.
Wait, but the problem states "two dipole transition", so each individual transition's probability has to be considered. However, I think the total probability for each two-step process would be the product of the probabilities for each step. But I need to recall how the transition probabilities are calculated. In dipole transitions, the transition probability is proportional to the square of the matrix element ⟨f|er| i⟩, where e is the electric charge (but since we're talking about probabilities, the charge squared), and r is the position operator. The actual matrix element depends on the wavefunctions and their overlap. But selection rules tell us when this matrix element is non-zero. For the transition to be allowed, l must change by ±1, but also, there are other factors like the parity, but for hydrogen-like atoms, since they have spherical symmetry, the parity is not an issue because all states have definite parity, but the matrix element for dipole transition depends on whether the integral of the wavefunctions' product with r (which has components x, y, z) is non-zero. The x, y, z operators mix the angular momentum states according to Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1.
But calculating the actual probability amplitudes would involve these integrals. However, maybe there is a general formula or a known result for the transition probabilities between specific states. Alternatively, maybe the probabilities are given by the number of allowed paths? For example, when there are multiple possible intermediate states, each path contributes to the total probability. But since the options list specific paths and their probabilities, perhaps each path has a certain probability.
For hydrogen-like atoms, transitions between states are classified by the type of transition: allowed, forbidden, etc. All dipole transitions that obey Δl = ±1 and Δm rules are allowed, so each path should have a non-zero probability.
But the problem gives different probabilities for each option: 2/3, 1/4, 1/3, etc. So I need to figure out which path has which probability.
Alternatively, maybe the question is about the relative probabilities of different pathways. For example, when there are multiple possible intermediate m states, the probability is split among them. For the first transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m'⟩, m' can be 0, 1, or -1. The probability for each m' might depend on the matrix elements. Similarly, for each intermediate state |2,1,m'⟩, the transition to |1,0,0⟩ would have certain probabilities depending on m'.
But I might not need the exact calculation here. Let's look at the options. The options list different intermediate states and probabilities. Let's check each option:

1: Option A: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and probability 2/3. Let's check if this path is allowed. First transition: Δn = -1 (from n=3 to n=2), Δl = +1 (from l=0 to l=1), m=0 to m=0. Wait, but Δm can be 0, ±1. Wait, in the first transition, initial m=0, final m' for the intermediate state is 0. So Δm = 0. That's allowed. Then, from |2,1,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩: Δn = -1, Δl = -1 (from l=1 to l=0), and Δm = 0 (from m=0 to m=0). That's allowed. So this path is allowed. The probability here is given as 2/3.
</Path>
<Path>
2: Option B is the path |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and probability 1/4. So in this case, the first transition is from m = 0 to m' = 1, which requires Δm = +1, which is allowed if the transition is allowed by Δm = 0, ±1, which it is. Then the second transition is from m' = 1 to m'' = 0, which is Δm = -1, which is allowed. So the path is allowed.
</Path>
<Path>
3: Option C: |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/3. The path is allowed. The first transition is Δl=+1 (from l=0 to l=1), Δm=0 (m=0 to m=0). The second transition is Δl=-1 (from l=1 to l=0), Δm=0 (m=0 to m=0). But wait, the magnetic quantum number m in the intermediate state is 0, and in the final state it's also 0. So Δm=0. But for dipole transitions, Δm can be 0, ±1. So both transitions here have Δm=0. However, the transition probabilities might depend on whether Δm=0 or ±1. Wait, transitions with Δm=0 might have different probabilities than Δm=±1. But I think all Δm=0, ±1 are allowed, but their probabilities can differ. For example, transitions with Δm=0 may have different matrix elements than Δm=±1. But I might need to recall if there's a factor of 1/√2 or something when m changes. Alternatively, maybe the probabilities are the same regardless of Δm. But maybe in the case of hydrogen-like atoms, the transition probabilities for different Δm within the same Δl are the same, except for factors depending on the specific components of the position operator. The dipole operator has components x, y, z. The z-component (which corresponds to m=0) might couple differently compared to the x and y components (which correspond to m=±1). So transitions where m changes by 0 (i.e., Δm=0) would involve the z-component, while Δm=±1 would involve x and y components. But the total dipole transition probability would be the sum over the three components. However, when considering a specific m transition, the probability might be different. For example, the transition with Δm=0 (z-component) might have a different amplitude than the transitions with Δm=±1 (x and y components). But I need to recall the formula for the transition rate. The transition rate (probability per unit time) is given by Fermi's golden rule: W = (2π/ħ)|⟨f|er| i⟩|2 ρ. Since here we are considering the transition probability, not the rate, but the matrix element squared is key. The matrix element ⟨2,1,0| z |3,0,0⟩ is non-zero. Similarly, ⟨2,1,1| z |3,0,0⟩ would be zero, but ⟨2,1,1| x ± iy |3,0,0⟩ might be non-zero. Wait, perhaps the dipole operator in its full vectorial form has components that connect different m values. For example, the x and y components involve m changes of ±1, while the z component involves Δm=0. So depending on the transition's m values, different components of the dipole operator are involved. Therefore, for the transition |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩, the matrix element would involve the z component of the dipole operator (since m=0 to m=0), whereas for |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩, it would involve the x + iy component (which corresponds to m changing by +1). Similarly, the second transition from |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ would involve the z component again, while transitions from |2,1,±1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ would involve x ± iy.
Therefore, the matrix elements for transitions with Δm=0 (involving z) might be different from those with Δm=±1 (involving x and y). However, the actual numerical values depend on the radial integrals and the angular parts.
But maybe in hydrogen-like atoms, due to the symmetry, the radial parts are such that the transition probabilities (the square of the matrix elements) for different m transitions (given the same Δl) are the same. Alternatively, maybe for different m components, the matrix elements are the same up to some factors. For example, for s-p transitions (Δl=1), the matrix elements for the z component (Δm=0) could be different from the x and y components (Δm=±1). But I think in hydrogen-like atoms, the matrix elements for the x, y, z components are related. However, since the initial state is |3,0,0⟩ (an s-state, so spherical symmetric except for the angular part) and transitions to p-states (l=1). The z component of the dipole operator would couple |0,0⟩ to |1,0⟩ (but wait, in terms of the m values, the initial m=0, so for the first transition, |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,0⟩ via z component. The matrix element would be non-zero. Similarly, the x and y components (which involve m=±1) would couple |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,±1⟩. However, because the x and y components each have contributions from m=±1, but when we square the matrix elements for the total dipole transition (summing over polarizations), we sum the probabilities for the different m changes. But in this problem, we are considering specific paths with given intermediate m states, so the probability for each path would correspond to the square of the matrix element for that specific m transition. Therefore, the probability for the path |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ would be the product of the probabilities for each step. But how can I determine these probabilities? Maybe from the given options, the answer is one of the fractions given, 2/3, 1/4, or 1/3. Since the total probability is the sum over all possible paths, maybe each path has equal probability? Or the probabilities are proportional to the square of the matrix elements. For hydrogen-like transitions between states, the matrix elements can be calculated using integrals over the wavefunctions. For dipole transitions within hydrogen-like atoms, the reduced matrix elements are often used, and the selection rules make certain integrals zero. For example, the matrix element for the transition |n, l, m⟩ → |n', l', m'⟩ is proportional to the integral: ∫ R_n l(r) r R_n' l'(r) dr × ∫ Y_l m(θ, φ) Y_1 m1(θ, φ) Y_l' m'(θ, φ) dΩ Where R_nl(r) are the radial functions, Y_lm are the spherical harmonics, and the angular integral is over the sphere. The angular integral can be evaluated using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. For the transition to be allowed, the integral over angles must be non-zero. The product of three spherical harmonics can be expressed in terms of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Specifically, the integral: ∫ Y_{l}^{m} Y_{1}^{k} Y_{l'}^{m'} dΩ is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient ⟨ l m; 1 k | l' m' ⟩. For the first transition |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m'⟩, the initial m = 0, and the dipole transition (which has angular momentum 1) can couple with m = 0 to give m' = 0 ± 1 or 0. So the possible m' are 0, 1, -1. But according to Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, the combination of angular momenta l=0 and l_dipole=1 gives possible total l' = |0 ±1| → 1. So the only possible l' is 1, and the m' can be 0, 1, -1. But each m' corresponds to a different Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. For m' = 0: ⟨ 0 0; 1 0 | 1 0 ⟩ = √((2*1 +1)/(4π)) * ⟨ 0 0; 1 0 | 1 0 ⟩. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient ⟨ 0 0; 1 0 | 1 0 ⟩ is 1, because there's only one way to combine l=0 and l'=1 with m=0 and m_dipole=0 to get l''=1 and m''=0. Wait, actually, the dipole operator has angular momentum 1, so when adding the initial angular momentum (l=0) with the dipole operator (angular momentum 1), we get l' =1. The m_dipole has to be such that m = m_initial + m_dipole. Since m_initial =0, m_dipole can be -1, 0, +1, leading to m_final = m_dipole. Wait, so for each m_final in the first transition (m' =0, 1, -1), the m_dipole is -1, 0, +1. The corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficients would be non-zero only when m_dipole = m_final - m_initial = m_final (since m_initial=0). Therefore, each m_final is associated with a specific m_dipole. The probability for each m_final is then determined by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. However, for the transition |0 0⟩ + dipole (which has l_dipole=1, m_dipole) → |1 m_final⟩. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining l=0 and l_dipole=1: For m_final =0, we need m_dipole=0. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient ⟨ 0 0; 1 0 | 1 0 ⟩ =1. For m_final =1, we need m_dipole=1. The coefficient ⟨ 0 0; 1 1 | 1 1 ⟩ =1. Similarly, for m_final =-1, m_dipole=-1. The coefficient ⟨ 0 0; 1 -1 | 1 -1 ⟩ =1. Therefore, each m_final has a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient of 1, but we need to consider the normalization. However, the overall normalization of the spherical harmonics would introduce factors. But when we compute the matrix element for the transition, the angular part is proportional to the integral: ∫ Y_{l'}^{m'*} Y_{l_dipole}^{m_dip} Y_{l}^{m} dΩ. For the transition operator, which is proportional to r (dipole), so the matrix element involves the product of the initial spherical harmonic, the dipole (which has angular part Y_1^{m_dip}), and the final spherical harmonic. The integral over angles can be written as: ∫ Y_{l'}^{m'}(θ,φ) Y_1^{m_dip}(θ,φ) Y_l^m(θ,φ) dΩ. Using the Clebsch-Gordan series, this integral is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. Given that l=0, m=0, and l'=1, m'. The integral becomes: ∫ Y_1^{m'} Y_1^{m_dip} Y_0^0 dΩ. But Y_0^0 is a constant (1/\sqrt{4π}). So the integral simplifies to (1/\sqrt{4π}) ∫ Y_1^{m'} Y_1^{m_dip} dΩ. But the integral of two spherical harmonics is zero unless they are conjugates and same l, m. However, since we are integrating over the sphere, ∫ Y_1^{m'} Y_1^{m_dip} dΩ = δ_{m', -m_dip} \sqrt{\frac{4π}{3}}. Therefore, the integral is non-zero only when m_dip = -m'. And the value is \sqrt{4π/3} δ_{m', -m_dip}. Therefore, the matrix element for the transition |l=0, m=0⟩ → |l'=1, m'⟩ via dipole operator with m_dip = -m'. The angular part of the matrix element is \sqrt{4π/3} δ_{m', -m_dip}. Therefore, the angular matrix element's magnitude depends on m'. But in terms of probability, the square of the matrix element would be (4π/3) for each allowed m', but also considering the radial integral. However, since the radial parts are the same for all m' (as the radial wavefunctions don't depend on m), the relative probabilities between different m' would be determined by the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. But from the previous calculation, each m' gives a matrix element proportional to \sqrt{4π/3} (due to the delta with m_dip = -m'). Therefore, all m' have the same angular matrix element magnitude. Therefore, the transition probabilities for different m' are the same. Hence, the probability for each m' (0, 1, -1) in the first transition is the same. Therefore, the total probability for the first transition is divided equally among the three m' states. Therefore, each first transition path (to m'=0, 1, -1) has a probability of 1/3. Then, for each intermediate m', the second transition to |1,0,0⟩ again has three possible paths (from m'=0, 1, -1). Let's analyze the second transition. For the second transition from |2,1,m'⟩ to |1,0,0⟩. Again, this is a dipole transition with Δl=1 (from l=1 to l=0, so Δl = -1). The selection rules are the same. The initial state has l'=1, m', and the final state has l''=0, m''=0. The change in m must be Δm = 0, ±1. Therefore, the transition is allowed if m'' = m' + Δm. But since m'' =0, this requires Δm = -m'. Therefore, the allowed transitions are those where m' can be 0, 1, or -1. - If m'=0, then Δm can be 0, so m''=0. But Δm must be -1, 0, +1. Wait, no: the dipole transition allows Δm = 0, ±1. So in the second transition, starting from m'=0, we can have m''=0 with Δm=0. Starting from m'=1, we can have m''=0 with Δm=-1. Starting from m'=-1, we can have m''=0 with Δm=+1. Therefore, each of these is allowed. The question is whether the probabilities for these transitions (given the same radial part) depend on the Δm. Similar to the first transition, the matrix element for the second transition is proportional to the integral: ∫ Y_{l''}^{m''*} Y_{l_dipole}^{m_dip}} Y_{l'}^{m'} dΩ. Here, the final state is |1,0,0⟩, so l''=0, m''=0. The dipole operator has l_dipole=1. The initial state is |2,1,m'⟩, so l'=1, m'. The integral becomes: ∫ Y_0^0 Y_1^{m_dip} Y_1^{m'} dΩ. Again, Y_0^0 is 1/\sqrt{4π}, so this integral simplifies to (1/\sqrt{4π}) ∫ Y_1^{m_dip} Y_1^{m'} dΩ. But similar to the first transition, this integral is non-zero only when m_dip = -m', and the value is \sqrt{4π/3} δ_{m', -m_dip}. Therefore, the matrix element for the second transition is non-zero only when m'' = m' + m_dip. Since m''=0, we have m_dip = -m'. Therefore, the allowed transitions are: - If m'=0, then m_dip can be 0 (but m_dip ranges from -1 to 1). Wait, but m''=0 = m' + m_dip = 0 + m_dip ⇒ m_dip=0. - If m'=1, then m_dip= -1. - If m'=-1, then m_dip=1. The matrix element's magnitude is \sqrt{4π/3} for each case. Therefore, similar to the first transition, the angular matrix elements for each second transition (given m') are the same. Therefore, the probability for each second transition is the same, regardless of m'. Therefore, the total probability for each two-step path is the product of the probabilities for each step. Since each first transition has a probability of 1/3 (because there are three possible m' states), and each second transition also has a probability of 1/3 (since for each intermediate m', there is only one m_dip that allows the transition, and the probability is again 1/3? Wait, no. Wait, in the first transition, from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m'⟩, there are three possible m' states (0, 1, -1), each with equal probability, so the probability for each is 1/3. However, in the second transition, from each |2,1,m'⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, there is only one allowed m_dip that causes the transition. But the selection rules allow Δm = 0, ±1. But since m''=0, and the initial m' can be 0, 1, or -1. For each initial m', the transition is allowed via an appropriate m_dip. The probability for each second transition is again determined by the square of the matrix element. Since, as calculated, the angular part of the matrix element is the same for all m', the probability for each second transition is the same. Therefore, if each first transition has probability 1/3, and each second transition has probability 1/3, then the total probability for each two-step path would be (1/3)*(1/3) = 1/9? But this can't be, because the total probability summing over all paths should be 1. Wait, let's think. There are three first transitions (m'=0,1,-1), each with probability 1/3. For each of these, there is one second transition to |1,0,0⟩, each with probability 1/3. Therefore, the total probability would be 3*(1/3)*(1/3) = 1/3. But this is the total probability for all two-step paths. However, the total probability for the decay |3,0,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ via any two-step path is 1/3? But this contradicts the options given, which have probabilities of 2/3, 1/4, or 1/3. Option C says 1/3, so maybe that's the case. But wait, perhaps the radial integral parts are different. However, if we consider that the radial integrals for the hydrogen atom between different n states may have different values, but in terms of the relative probabilities for different m transitions (given same n and l), the probabilities could be the same. But wait, in the given options, the routes differ in their intermediate m states, but the probabilities are given as 2/3, 1/3, or 1/4. Since option C is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/3. If the total probability over all paths is 1/3, as I thought before (3 paths each with probability 1/9), but 3*1/9=1/3. But then why is option C's probability 1/3 while the others are 1/4 or 2/3? Wait, maybe the path |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ might have a different probability than the other paths. Wait, perhaps the first transition has different probabilities for m'=0 compared to m'=±1. Let me check. Wait, maybe when considering the actual matrix elements for the z component (m=0) versus x and y components (m=±1), the probabilities are different. For example, the transition |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ involves the z component of the dipole moment. The transition |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,±1⟩ involves the x ∓ iy components (which correspond to m_dipole=±1). The matrix elements for these transitions might have different magnitudes. In hydrogen-like atoms, the expectation value of the z component (involving l=0 to l=1, m=0) might differ from the x or y components. The matrix element for the z component is: ⟨2,1,0| e r cosθ |3,0,0⟩. While for the x component: ⟨2,1,1| e r (sinθ e^{iφ}) |3,0,0⟩. The radial parts are the same except for the angular parts. However, the radial integral for the z component might be different from the x or y components. For hydrogen-like atoms, the matrix elements for the z component (cosθ) and the x or y components (sinθ e^{±iφ}) can differ because the radial functions R_{30}(r) and R_{21}(r) have different dependencies. However, the selection rules and the angular parts affect the overall result. But in hydrogen-like atoms, the matrix elements for allowed transitions (Δl=1) between different n states can be calculated using formulae. For example, the integral for the z component: ∫ Y_1^0 Y_0^0 dΩ = 0? Wait, no. Wait, the angular part for the z component is proportional to cosθ, which is Y_1^0. The matrix element for the transition would involve: ∫ Y_{1}^{0*} Y_{0}^{0} Y_{1}^{0} dΩ. Wait, perhaps I need to consider the actual product of spherical harmonics. The dipole term for the z component is proportional to Y_1^0. So the matrix element for the z component is: ∫ Y_{l'}^{m'} Y_{1}^{0} Y_{l}^{m} dΩ. For the first transition, l=0, m=0, l'=1, m'=0. So: ∫ Y_{1}^{0*} Y_{1}^{0} Y_{0}^{0} dΩ. But Y_{0}^{0} is 1/\sqrt{4π}, so: (1/\sqrt{4π}) ∫ Y_{1}^{0*} Y_{1}^{0} dΩ = (1/\sqrt{4π}) * (4π/3)^{1/2} δ_{0,0} } Wait, the integral of |Y_1^0|^2 over the sphere is 4π/3. Therefore, the integral becomes (1/\sqrt{4π}) * \sqrt{4π/3} = \sqrt{π/3}. Therefore, the angular part of the matrix element is \sqrt{π/3}. For the transition via the x or y components (m'=1 or -1), the matrix element would involve integrating Y_{1}^{±1*} Y_{1}^{m_dip} Y_{0}^{0} dΩ. But since Y_{0}^{0} is isotropic, the integral would be zero unless m_dip = ∓1. Wait, no, for the initial m=0, to get a non-zero integral, the product Y_{1}^{±1*} Y_{1}^{m_dip} must have a component with m=0. But integrating over angles: ∫ Y_{1}^{-1*} Y_{1}^{m_dip} Y_{0}^{0} dΩ = ∫ Y_{1}^{1} Y_{1}^{m_dip} Y_{0}^{0} dΩ. But Y_{1}^{1} Y_{1}^{m_dip} can couple to Y_{0}^{0} only if m_dip = -1. Similarly, the integral would be proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. But I think these integrals are more complex. Alternatively, using the fact that the product of two spherical harmonics can be expressed as a sum of spherical harmonics. Y_{1}^{m} Y_{1}^{m'} = \sum_{L,M} \sqrt{\frac{(4π)}{}} } ... This is getting complicated, but perhaps in the case of hydrogen-like transitions, the matrix elements for different m transitions (given same n and l) have the same magnitude due to symmetry. However, since the z component is real, while the x and y components involve imaginary terms (when expressed as Y_1^{±1}), the matrix elements might have different magnitudes. Alternatively, in practice, the transition probabilities (i.e., the square of the matrix elements) for hydrogen-like atoms between s and p states are the same for all m components. This is because the radial integral is the same and the angular part, when integrated, gives the same result for each m due to symmetry. Therefore, the transition probabilities for |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, or |2,1,-1⟩ are all the same. Therefore, each first transition has a probability of 1/3. Similarly, for the second transition from each |2,1,m'⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, each has a probability of 1/3. Therefore, each two-step path (through m'=0, 1, or -1) has a total probability of (1/3)*(1/3) = 1/9. However, the total probability for all paths would be 3*(1/9) = 1/3. But the question is asking for the probability corresponding to a specific path. The options given are A) 2/3, B) 1/4, C) 1/3, D) 1/4. Since each individual path has a probability of 1/9, but option C is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/3, which is inconsistent with the previous conclusion. But this is a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps my assumption that the radial parts are the same for all m is incorrect. Wait, in hydrogen-like atoms, the radial wavefunctions R_{nl} depend on n and l, but not on m. Therefore, the radial integral for the matrix element ⟨2,1,0| e r |3,0,0⟩ and ⟨2,1,1| e r |3,0,0⟩ would involve the same radial functions R_{21} and R_{30}, so the radial part of the integral would be the same. The difference would lie only in the angular part. But as we saw, the angular integrals for m=0 and m=±1 might be the same. Therefore, the square of the matrix elements for each transition would be the same<Path>
4: Option D: |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4. The first transition is from m=0 to m=-1. Δm = -1. Then the second transition is from m=-1 to m=0, so Δm=+1. So both transitions have Δm=-1 and +1 respectively. The probability here is 1/4.

okay, so i have this quantum mechanics problem here about the hydrogen atom and dipole transitions. the question is asking about the decay of a |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions. i need to figure out the correct transition route and the corresponding probability from the given options a, b, c, and d.
first, let me recall some rules about dipole transitions in hydrogen-like atoms.
in the non-relativistic theory, the allowed transitions are those where the principal quantum number n changes, but there are selection rules. the main selection rule for dipole transitions is that the change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number l must be δl = ±1. also, the magnetic quantum number m can change by δm = 0, ±1.
since the transition is happening in two steps, each step has to follow the δl = ±1 rule.
let's think in parallel.

<path>
1: the initial state is |3,0,0⟩. the first transition must adhere to the selection rule δl = ±1. the orbital angular momentum quantum number l for the initial state is 0. applying the rule δl = ±1 results in possible values of l' for the intermediate state as 0 ± 1, which means l' can be 1 or -1. however, l' must be a non-negative integer, so the only valid possibility is l' = 1. the intermediate state's principal quantum number n' must be less than 3 because the atom is decaying. the possible values for n' are 1 or 2. the final state after the second transition is |1,0,0⟩. the intermediate state must therefore have a principal quantum number n' greater than 1. this condition means n' must be 2. the first transition from |3,0,0⟩ must therefore go to |2,1,m'⟩. the magnetic quantum number m' for the intermediate state must satisfy the selection rule δm = 0, ±1. the initial m is 0, so m' can be 0, 1, or -1. the intermediate state is thus |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, or |2,1,-1⟩.

1: the second transition from an intermediate state |2,1,0⟩ must follow the selection rule δl = ±1, leading to a final l'' of 0 or 2. the final state is |1,0,0⟩, which has l'' = 0. for a transition from l' = 1 to l'' = 0, the change δl'' = -1 satisfies the rule. the transition |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ is therefore allowed. the magnetic quantum number m'' for the final state must satisfy δm'' = 0, ±1. the initial m' is 0, so m'' can be 0, 1, or -1. the final state has m'' = 0, which is allowed. the transition |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ is permitted. the overall transition route |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ is a possible path. this path corresponds to option c.

3: the final state |1,0,0⟩ has l = 0 and m = 0. the intermediate state for the second transition is |2,1,-1⟩, which has l' = 1 and m' = -1. the second transition must satisfy δl = ±1 and δm = 0, ±1. a transition from l' = 1 to l = 0 requires δl = -1. the change in magnetic quantum number δm is m - m' = 0 - (-1) = +1, satisfying the δm = ±1 rule. this transition is allowed. the route |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,-1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ is therefore a possible path.
</path>
<conclusion>
the second transition from |2,1,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ is allowed, corresponding to option c. the second transition from |2,1,1⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ is allowed, corresponding to option b. the second transition from |2,1,-1⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ is allowed, corresponding to option d.

similarly, for the second transition from |2,1,1⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, δl = -1 and δm = -1, which are allowed. so that path is allowed as well. similarly, for the transition from |2,1,-1⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, δl = -1 and δm = +1 (since m goes from -1 to 0), which is also allowed. so all three intermediate m states (0, 1, -1) can lead to the final state |1,0,0⟩. but now, the question is about the probability of each path.
wait, but the problem states "two dipole transition", so each individual transition's probability has to be considered. however, i think the total probability for each two-step process would be the product of the probabilities for each step. but i need to recall how the transition probabilities are calculated. in dipole transitions, the transition probability is proportional to the square of the matrix element ⟨f|er| i⟩, where e is the electric charge (but since we're talking about probabilities, the charge squared), and r is the position operator. the actual matrix element depends on the wavefunctions and their overlap. but selection rules tell us when this matrix element is non-zero. for the transition to be allowed, l must change by ±1, but also, there are other factors like the parity, but for hydrogen-like atoms, since they have spherical symmetry, the parity is not an issue because all states have definite parity, but the matrix element for dipole transition depends on whether the integral of the wavefunctions' product with r (which has components x, y, z) is non-zero. the x, y, z operators mix the angular momentum states according to δl = ±1 and δm = 0, ±1.
but calculating the actual probability amplitudes would involve these integrals. however, maybe there is a general formula or a known result for the transition probabilities between specific states. alternatively, maybe the probabilities are given by the number of allowed paths? for example, when there are multiple possible intermediate states, each path contributes to the total probability. but since the options list specific paths and their probabilities, perhaps each path has a certain probability.
for hydrogen-like atoms, transitions between states are classified by the type of transition: allowed, forbidden, etc. all dipole transitions that obey δl = ±1 and δm rules are allowed, so each path should have a non-zero probability.
but the problem gives different probabilities for each option: 2/3, 1/4, 1/3, etc. so i need to figure out which path has which probability.
alternatively, maybe the question is about the relative probabilities of different pathways. for example, when there are multiple possible intermediate m states, the probability is split among them. for the first transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m'⟩, m' can be 0, 1, or -1. the probability for each m' might depend on the matrix elements. similarly, for each intermediate state |2,1,m'⟩, the transition to |1,0,0⟩ would have certain probabilities depending on m'.
but i might not need the exact calculation here. let's look at the options. the options list different intermediate states and probabilities. let's check each option:
let's think in parallel.

1: option a: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and probability 2/3. let's check if this path is allowed. first transition: δn = -1 (from n=3 to n=2), δl = +1 (from l=0 to l=1), m=0 to m=0. wait, but δm can be 0, ±1. wait, in the first transition, initial m=0, final m' for the intermediate state is 0. so δm = 0. that's allowed. then, from |2,1,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩: δn = -1, δl = -1 (from l=1 to l=0), and δm = 0 (from m=0 to m=0). that's allowed. so this path is allowed. the probability here is given as 2/3.
</path>
<path>
2: option b is the path |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and probability 1/4. so in this case, the first transition is from m = 0 to m' = 1, which requires δm = +1, which is allowed if the transition is allowed by δm = 0, ±1, which it is. then the second transition is from m' = 1 to m'' = 0, which is δm = -1, which is allowed. so the path is allowed.
</path>
<path>
3: option c: |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/3. the path is allowed. the first transition is δl=+1 (from l=0 to l=1), δm=0 (m=0 to m=0). the second transition is δl=-1 (from l=1 to l=0), δm=0 (m=0 to m=0). but wait, the magnetic quantum number m in the intermediate state is 0, and in the final state it's also 0. so δm=0. but for dipole transitions, δm can be 0, ±1. so both transitions here have δm=0. however, the transition probabilities might depend on whether δm=0 or ±1. wait, transitions with δm=0 might have different probabilities than δm=±1. but i think all δm=0, ±1 are allowed, but their probabilities can differ. for example, transitions with δm=0 may have different matrix elements than δm=±1. but i might need to recall if there's a factor of 1/√2 or something when m changes. alternatively, maybe the probabilities are the same regardless of δm. but maybe in the case of hydrogen-like atoms, the transition probabilities for different δm within the same δl are the same, except for factors depending on the specific components of the position operator. the dipole operator has components x, y, z. the z-component (which corresponds to m=0) might couple differently compared to the x and y components (which correspond to m=±1). so transitions where m changes by 0 (i.e., δm=0) would involve the z-component, while δm=±1 would involve x and y components. but the total dipole transition probability would be the sum over the three components. however, when considering a specific m transition, the probability might be different. for example, the transition with δm=0 (z-component) might have a different amplitude than the transitions with δm=±1 (x and y components). but i need to recall the formula for the transition rate. the transition rate (probability per unit time) is given by fermi's golden rule: w = (2π/ħ)|⟨f|er| i⟩|2 ρ. since here we are considering the transition probability, not the rate, but the matrix element squared is key. the matrix element ⟨2,1,0| z |3,0,0⟩ is non-zero. similarly, ⟨2,1,1| z |3,0,0⟩ would be zero, but ⟨2,1,1| x ± iy |3,0,0⟩ might be non-zero. wait, perhaps the dipole operator in its full vectorial form has components that connect different m values. for example, the x and y components involve m changes of ±1, while the z component involves δm=0. so depending on the transition's m values, different components of the dipole operator are involved. therefore, for the transition |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩, the matrix element would involve the z component of the dipole operator (since m=0 to m=0), whereas for |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,1⟩, it would involve the x + iy component (which corresponds to m changing by +1). similarly, the second transition from |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ would involve the z component again, while transitions from |2,1,±1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ would involve x ± iy.
therefore, the matrix elements for transitions with δm=0 (involving z) might be different from those with δm=±1 (involving x and y). however, the actual numerical values depend on the radial integrals and the angular parts.
but maybe in hydrogen-like atoms, due to the symmetry, the radial parts are such that the transition probabilities (the square of the matrix elements) for different m transitions (given the same δl) are the same. alternatively, maybe for different m components, the matrix elements are the same up to some factors. for example, for s-p transitions (δl=1), the matrix elements for the z component (δm=0) could be different from the x and y components (δm=±1). but i think in hydrogen-like atoms, the matrix elements for the x, y, z components are related. however, since the initial state is |3,0,0⟩ (an s-state, so spherical symmetric except for the angular part) and transitions to p-states (l=1). the z component of the dipole operator would couple |0,0⟩ to |1,0⟩ (but wait, in terms of the m values, the initial m=0, so for the first transition, |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,0⟩ via z component. the matrix element would be non-zero. similarly, the x and y components (which involve m=±1) would couple |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,±1⟩. however, because the x and y components each have contributions from m=±1, but when we square the matrix elements for the total dipole transition (summing over polarizations), we sum the probabilities for the different m changes. but in this problem, we are considering specific paths with given intermediate m states, so the probability for each path would correspond to the square of the matrix element for that specific m transition. therefore, the probability for the path |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ would be the product of the probabilities for each step. but how can i determine these probabilities? maybe from the given options, the answer is one of the fractions given, 2/3, 1/4, or 1/3. since the total probability is the sum over all possible paths, maybe each path has equal probability? or the probabilities are proportional to the square of the matrix elements. for hydrogen-like transitions between states, the matrix elements can be calculated using integrals over the wavefunctions. for dipole transitions within hydrogen-like atoms, the reduced matrix elements are often used, and the selection rules make certain integrals zero. for example, the matrix element for the transition |n, l, m⟩ → |n', l', m'⟩ is proportional to the integral: ∫ r_n l(r) r r_n' l'(r) dr × ∫ y_l m(θ, φ) y_1 m1(θ, φ) y_l' m'(θ, φ) dω where r_nl(r) are the radial functions, y_lm are the spherical harmonics, and the angular integral is over the sphere. the angular integral can be evaluated using clebsch-gordan coefficients. for the transition to be allowed, the integral over angles must be non-zero. the product of three spherical harmonics can be expressed in terms of clebsch-gordan coefficients. specifically, the integral: ∫ y_{l}^{m} y_{1}^{k} y_{l'}^{m'} dω is proportional to the clebsch-gordan coefficient ⟨ l m; 1 k | l' m' ⟩. for the first transition |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m'⟩, the initial m = 0, and the dipole transition (which has angular momentum 1) can couple with m = 0 to give m' = 0 ± 1 or 0. so the possible m' are 0, 1, -1. but according to clebsch-gordan coefficients, the combination of angular momenta l=0 and l_dipole=1 gives possible total l' = |0 ±1| → 1. so the only possible l' is 1, and the m' can be 0, 1, -1. but each m' corresponds to a different clebsch-gordan coefficient. for m' = 0: ⟨ 0 0; 1 0 | 1 0 ⟩ = √((2*1 +1)/(4π)) * ⟨ 0 0; 1 0 | 1 0 ⟩. the clebsch-gordan coefficient ⟨ 0 0; 1 0 | 1 0 ⟩ is 1, because there's only one way to combine l=0 and l'=1 with m=0 and m_dipole=0 to get l''=1 and m''=0. wait, actually, the dipole operator has angular momentum 1, so when adding the initial angular momentum (l=0) with the dipole operator (angular momentum 1), we get l' =1. the m_dipole has to be such that m = m_initial + m_dipole. since m_initial =0, m_dipole can be -1, 0, +1, leading to m_final = m_dipole. wait, so for each m_final in the first transition (m' =0, 1, -1), the m_dipole is -1, 0, +1. the corresponding clebsch-gordan coefficients would be non-zero only when m_dipole = m_final - m_initial = m_final (since m_initial=0). therefore, each m_final is associated with a specific m_dipole. the probability for each m_final is then determined by the square of the clebsch-gordan coefficient. however, for the transition |0 0⟩ + dipole (which has l_dipole=1, m_dipole) → |1 m_final⟩. the clebsch-gordan coefficients for combining l=0 and l_dipole=1: for m_final =0, we need m_dipole=0. the clebsch-gordan coefficient ⟨ 0 0; 1 0 | 1 0 ⟩ =1. for m_final =1, we need m_dipole=1. the coefficient ⟨ 0 0; 1 1 | 1 1 ⟩ =1. similarly, for m_final =-1, m_dipole=-1. the coefficient ⟨ 0 0; 1 -1 | 1 -1 ⟩ =1. therefore, each m_final has a clebsch-gordan coefficient of 1, but we need to consider the normalization. however, the overall normalization of the spherical harmonics would introduce factors. but when we compute the matrix element for the transition, the angular part is proportional to the integral: ∫ y_{l'}^{m'*} y_{l_dipole}^{m_dip} y_{l}^{m} dω. for the transition operator, which is proportional to r (dipole), so the matrix element involves the product of the initial spherical harmonic, the dipole (which has angular part y_1^{m_dip}), and the final spherical harmonic. the integral over angles can be written as: ∫ y_{l'}^{m'}(θ,φ) y_1^{m_dip}(θ,φ) y_l^m(θ,φ) dω. using the clebsch-gordan series, this integral is proportional to the clebsch-gordan coefficient. given that l=0, m=0, and l'=1, m'. the integral becomes: ∫ y_1^{m'} y_1^{m_dip} y_0^0 dω. but y_0^0 is a constant (1/\sqrt{4π}). so the integral simplifies to (1/\sqrt{4π}) ∫ y_1^{m'} y_1^{m_dip} dω. but the integral of two spherical harmonics is zero unless they are conjugates and same l, m. however, since we are integrating over the sphere, ∫ y_1^{m'} y_1^{m_dip} dω = δ_{m', -m_dip} \sqrt{\frac{4π}{3}}. therefore, the integral is non-zero only when m_dip = -m'. and the value is \sqrt{4π/3} δ_{m', -m_dip}. therefore, the matrix element for the transition |l=0, m=0⟩ → |l'=1, m'⟩ via dipole operator with m_dip = -m'. the angular part of the matrix element is \sqrt{4π/3} δ_{m', -m_dip}. therefore, the angular matrix element's magnitude depends on m'. but in terms of probability, the square of the matrix element would be (4π/3) for each allowed m', but also considering the radial integral. however, since the radial parts are the same for all m' (as the radial wavefunctions don't depend on m), the relative probabilities between different m' would be determined by the square of the clebsch-gordan coefficients. but from the previous calculation, each m' gives a matrix element proportional to \sqrt{4π/3} (due to the delta with m_dip = -m'). therefore, all m' have the same angular matrix element magnitude. therefore, the transition probabilities for different m' are the same. hence, the probability for each m' (0, 1, -1) in the first transition is the same. therefore, the total probability for the first transition is divided equally among the three m' states. therefore, each first transition path (to m'=0, 1, -1) has a probability of 1/3. then, for each intermediate m', the second transition to |1,0,0⟩ again has three possible paths (from m'=0, 1, -1). let's analyze the second transition. for the second transition from |2,1,m'⟩ to |1,0,0⟩. again, this is a dipole transition with δl=1 (from l=1 to l=0, so δl = -1). the selection rules are the same. the initial state has l'=1, m', and the final state has l''=0, m''=0. the change in m must be δm = 0, ±1. therefore, the transition is allowed if m'' = m' + δm. but since m'' =0, this requires δm = -m'. therefore, the allowed transitions are those where m' can be 0, 1, or -1. - if m'=0, then δm can be 0, so m''=0. but δm must be -1, 0, +1. wait, no: the dipole transition allows δm = 0, ±1. so in the second transition, starting from m'=0, we can have m''=0 with δm=0. starting from m'=1, we can have m''=0 with δm=-1. starting from m'=-1, we can have m''=0 with δm=+1. therefore, each of these is allowed. the question is whether the probabilities for these transitions (given the same radial part) depend on the δm. similar to the first transition, the matrix element for the second transition is proportional to the integral: ∫ y_{l''}^{m''*} y_{l_dipole}^{m_dip}} y_{l'}^{m'} dω. here, the final state is |1,0,0⟩, so l''=0, m''=0. the dipole operator has l_dipole=1. the initial state is |2,1,m'⟩, so l'=1, m'. the integral becomes: ∫ y_0^0 y_1^{m_dip} y_1^{m'} dω. again, y_0^0 is 1/\sqrt{4π}, so this integral simplifies to (1/\sqrt{4π}) ∫ y_1^{m_dip} y_1^{m'} dω. but similar to the first transition, this integral is non-zero only when m_dip = -m', and the value is \sqrt{4π/3} δ_{m', -m_dip}. therefore, the matrix element for the second transition is non-zero only when m'' = m' + m_dip. since m''=0, we have m_dip = -m'. therefore, the allowed transitions are: - if m'=0, then m_dip can be 0 (but m_dip ranges from -1 to 1). wait, but m''=0 = m' + m_dip = 0 + m_dip ⇒ m_dip=0. - if m'=1, then m_dip= -1. - if m'=-1, then m_dip=1. the matrix element's magnitude is \sqrt{4π/3} for each case. therefore, similar to the first transition, the angular matrix elements for each second transition (given m') are the same. therefore, the probability for each second transition is the same, regardless of m'. therefore, the total probability for each two-step path is the product of the probabilities for each step. since each first transition has a probability of 1/3 (because there are three possible m' states), and each second transition also has a probability of 1/3 (since for each intermediate m', there is only one m_dip that allows the transition, and the probability is again 1/3? wait, no. wait, in the first transition, from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m'⟩, there are three possible m' states (0, 1, -1), each with equal probability, so the probability for each is 1/3. however, in the second transition, from each |2,1,m'⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, there is only one allowed m_dip that causes the transition. but the selection rules allow δm = 0, ±1. but since m''=0, and the initial m' can be 0, 1, or -1. for each initial m', the transition is allowed via an appropriate m_dip. the probability for each second transition is again determined by the square of the matrix element. since, as calculated, the angular part of the matrix element is the same for all m', the probability for each second transition is the same. therefore, if each first transition has probability 1/3, and each second transition has probability 1/3, then the total probability for each two-step path would be (1/3)*(1/3) = 1/9? but this can't be, because the total probability summing over all paths should be 1. wait, let's think. there are three first transitions (m'=0,1,-1), each with probability 1/3. for each of these, there is one second transition to |1,0,0⟩, each with probability 1/3. therefore, the total probability would be 3*(1/3)*(1/3) = 1/3. but this is the total probability for all two-step paths. however, the total probability for the decay |3,0,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ via any two-step path is 1/3? but this contradicts the options given, which have probabilities of 2/3, 1/4, or 1/3. option c says 1/3, so maybe that's the case. but wait, perhaps the radial integral parts are different. however, if we consider that the radial integrals for the hydrogen atom between different n states may have different values, but in terms of the relative probabilities for different m transitions (given same n and l), the probabilities could be the same. but wait, in the given options, the routes differ in their intermediate m states, but the probabilities are given as 2/3, 1/3, or 1/4. since option c is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/3. if the total probability over all paths is 1/3, as i thought before (3 paths each with probability 1/9), but 3*1/9=1/3. but then why is option c's probability 1/3 while the others are 1/4 or 2/3? wait, maybe the path |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ might have a different probability than the other paths. wait, perhaps the first transition has different probabilities for m'=0 compared to m'=±1. let me check. wait, maybe when considering the actual matrix elements for the z component (m=0) versus x and y components (m=±1), the probabilities are different. for example, the transition |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ involves the z component of the dipole moment. the transition |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,±1⟩ involves the x ∓ iy components (which correspond to m_dipole=±1). the matrix elements for these transitions might have different magnitudes. in hydrogen-like atoms, the expectation value of the z component (involving l=0 to l=1, m=0) might differ from the x or y components. the matrix element for the z component is: ⟨2,1,0| e r cosθ |3,0,0⟩. while for the x component: ⟨2,1,1| e r (sinθ e^{iφ}) |3,0,0⟩. the radial parts are the same except for the angular parts. however, the radial integral for the z component might be different from the x or y components. for hydrogen-like atoms, the matrix elements for the z component (cosθ) and the x or y components (sinθ e^{±iφ}) can differ because the radial functions r_{30}(r) and r_{21}(r) have different dependencies. however, the selection rules and the angular parts affect the overall result. but in hydrogen-like atoms, the matrix elements for allowed transitions (δl=1) between different n states can be calculated using formulae. for example, the integral for the z component: ∫ y_1^0 y_0^0 dω = 0? wait, no. wait, the angular part for the z component is proportional to cosθ, which is y_1^0. the matrix element for the transition would involve: ∫ y_{1}^{0*} y_{0}^{0} y_{1}^{0} dω. wait, perhaps i need to consider the actual product of spherical harmonics. the dipole term for the z component is proportional to y_1^0. so the matrix element for the z component is: ∫ y_{l'}^{m'} y_{1}^{0} y_{l}^{m} dω. for the first transition, l=0, m=0, l'=1, m'=0. so: ∫ y_{1}^{0*} y_{1}^{0} y_{0}^{0} dω. but y_{0}^{0} is 1/\sqrt{4π}, so: (1/\sqrt{4π}) ∫ y_{1}^{0*} y_{1}^{0} dω = (1/\sqrt{4π}) * (4π/3)^{1/2} δ_{0,0} } wait, the integral of |y_1^0|^2 over the sphere is 4π/3. therefore, the integral becomes (1/\sqrt{4π}) * \sqrt{4π/3} = \sqrt{π/3}. therefore, the angular part of the matrix element is \sqrt{π/3}. for the transition via the x or y components (m'=1 or -1), the matrix element would involve integrating y_{1}^{±1*} y_{1}^{m_dip} y_{0}^{0} dω. but since y_{0}^{0} is isotropic, the integral would be zero unless m_dip = ∓1. wait, no, for the initial m=0, to get a non-zero integral, the product y_{1}^{±1*} y_{1}^{m_dip} must have a component with m=0. but integrating over angles: ∫ y_{1}^{-1*} y_{1}^{m_dip} y_{0}^{0} dω = ∫ y_{1}^{1} y_{1}^{m_dip} y_{0}^{0} dω. but y_{1}^{1} y_{1}^{m_dip} can couple to y_{0}^{0} only if m_dip = -1. similarly, the integral would be proportional to the clebsch-gordan coefficient. but i think these integrals are more complex. alternatively, using the fact that the product of two spherical harmonics can be expressed as a sum of spherical harmonics. y_{1}^{m} y_{1}^{m'} = \sum_{l,m} \sqrt{\frac{(4π)}{}} } ... this is getting complicated, but perhaps in the case of hydrogen-like transitions, the matrix elements for different m transitions (given same n and l) have the same magnitude due to symmetry. however, since the z component is real, while the x and y components involve imaginary terms (when expressed as y_1^{±1}), the matrix elements might have different magnitudes. alternatively, in practice, the transition probabilities (i.e., the square of the matrix elements) for hydrogen-like atoms between s and p states are the same for all m components. this is because the radial integral is the same and the angular part, when integrated, gives the same result for each m due to symmetry. therefore, the transition probabilities for |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, or |2,1,-1⟩ are all the same. therefore, each first transition has a probability of 1/3. similarly, for the second transition from each |2,1,m'⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, each has a probability of 1/3. therefore, each two-step path (through m'=0, 1, or -1) has a total probability of (1/3)*(1/3) = 1/9. however, the total probability for all paths would be 3*(1/9) = 1/3. but the question is asking for the probability corresponding to a specific path. the options given are a) 2/3, b) 1/4, c) 1/3, d) 1/4. since each individual path has a probability of 1/9, but option c is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ with probability 1/3, which is inconsistent with the previous conclusion. but this is a contradiction. therefore, perhaps my assumption that the radial parts are the same for all m is incorrect. wait, in hydrogen-like atoms, the radial wavefunctions r_{nl} depend on n and l, but not on m. therefore, the radial integral for the matrix element ⟨2,1,0| e r |3,0,0⟩ and ⟨2,1,1| e r |3,0,0⟩ would involve the same radial functions r_{21} and r_{30}, so the radial part of the integral would be the same. the difference would lie only in the angular part. but as we saw, the angular integrals for m=0 and m=±1 might be the same. therefore, the square of the matrix elements for each transition would be the same<path>
4: option d: |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,-1⟩→|1,0,0⟩ and 1/4. the first transition is from m=0 to m=-1. δm = -1. then the second transition is from m=-1 to m=0, so δm=+1. so both transitions have δm=-1 and +1 respectively. the probability here is 1/4.
