<Think>
Okay, let's see. The problem is about solar neutrinos and their flux in different energy bands if the pp-III branch stops. Hmm. First, I need to remember how solar neutrinos are produced. I recall that the proton-proton (pp) chain reactions are the main source of energy in the Sun, especially in its core. There are different branches of the pp chain. The main one is pp-I, which produces neutrinos at certain energies. Then there are pp-II and pp-III branches, which are less dominant but contribute to higher energy neutrinos.
Let's think in parallel.

But the question is about neutrino energies between 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV. Wait, 700-800 keV is 0.7 to 0.8 MeV, and 800-900 keV is 0.8 to 0.9 MeV. So neither of these is the 13.7 MeV from pp-III. So why does stopping the pp-III branch affect these energy ranges?
Wait, maybe the pp-III branch's contribution is not direct, but maybe through some other reactions? Wait, perhaps the pp-III branch is part of a chain that leads to other neutrino-producing reactions. Let me think. The pp-III branch: when two protons collide to form deuterium, helium-3, etc. Wait, the pp-I, II, III refer to different possible decays. Let me check that again.
Wait, the pp chain starts with pp fusion into deuterium, emitting a positron and neutrino. That's the pp-I reaction. Then, the deuterium can fuse with another proton to form helium-3 (pp-I continues), or it can capture a proton and go into other branches. Wait, perhaps pp-II and pp-III are branches that involve beryllium and boron? Wait, I might be confusing the pp chain with the CNO cycle. Let me clarify.
The pp chain has these main branches:
1. pp-I: proton + proton → deuterium + positron + neutrino (energy up to ~0.42 MeV)
Then deuterium + proton → helium-3 + gamma. Then helium-3 + helium-3 → helium-4 + 2 protons. But this doesn't produce neutrinos.
2. pp-II: This branch involves helium-3 from pp-I reacting with a beryllium-7, but I think pp-II is a much rarer branch. Wait, maybe pp-II and pp-III are other possible fusions. Alternatively, perhaps pp-III produces a higher-energy neutrino. But the question is about stopping the pp-III branch, so we need to know what neutrinos that branch produces.
Alternatively, maybe the pp-III neutrinos are in a different energy range, but the question is about the ratio of fluxes in 0.7-0.8 MeV and 0.8-0.9 MeV. So if pp-III produces neutrinos above 13 MeV, then stopping pp-III wouldn't affect those energies. Therefore, perhaps those energy bands are produced by other reactions, like CNO cycle? Wait, the CNO cycle produces higher-energy neutrinos. But the problem states that only the pp-III branch stopped, while others continue. So if the 0.7-0.9 MeV neutrinos are produced by the pp-III branch, then stopping it would reduce the flux in those bands. But the question is about the ratio between two bands. Wait, the question is: "What would be the approximate ratio of the flux between two bands of neutrino energies of 700-800 KeV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2)." Then, after the pp-III branch stops. So if the pp-III branch produces neutrinos in both bands, but stopping it would decrease the flux in both bands. But since they are asking for the ratio after the branch stops, but maybe the original fluxes (before stopping) are dominated by pp-III in those energy ranges. Then, if you stop pp-III, the flux in both bands goes down, but perhaps the ratio between them changes. Wait, but the question is a touchy after the pp-III stops. So if pp-III is stopped, and if those energy bands (0.7-0.8 MeV and 0.8-0.9 MeV) are primarily from pp-III, then their flux would go to zero. But the ratio would be zero flux in both, but the ratio is undefined. That can't be. Therefore, perhaps other reactions contribute to those energy bands as well. For example, the CNO cycle produces neutrinos around 1.5 MeV, I think. So maybe those two bands (0.7-0.8 and 0.8-0.9 MeV) are from lower-energy branches of the pp chain.
Wait, pp-I produces up to 0.42 MeV. So maybe higher energy neutrinos in pp chain require other branches. Wait, perhaps there are other neutrino sources between 0.7-0.9 MeV. Let's see. The decay of boron-8 into beryllium-8 produces neutrinos around 7-8 MeV, but that's in the Sun's core. Wait, no, boron-8 decay produces a neutrino with an energy up to 14.7 MeV. That's way higher. Alternatively, maybe there are proton-electron scattering events or something else. Wait, maybe the pp-III branch produces neutrinos in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range. If that is the case, then stopping the pp-III branch would eliminate that flux, leading to a ratio of zero. But the options are 0.1, 0.01, 10, 1. So zero isn't an option. Wait, but the question says "hypothetically, the pp-III branch suddenly stopped... about 8 and a half minutes ago". The neutrinos travel from the Sun's core to Earth in about 8 minutes (since they travel at nearly the speed of light). So if the pp-III branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos reaching Earth now would have been emitted 8.5 minutes ago. Therefore, the flux now would reflect the pp-III branch already stopped. So if pp-III contributes to the 0.7-0.9 MeV bands, the flux in those bands would immediately drop when pp-III stops. However, other reactions (like pp-I) continue. But if pp-III is stopped, how does that affect the flux in those two bands? The ratio of band 1 to band 2 after pp-III is stopped.
Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch produces neutrinos in both bands, but with different efficiencies. For example, maybe pp-III produces more neutrinos in band 1 (0.7-0.8 MeV) than in band 2 (0.8-0.9 MeV), so stopping pp-III would reduce band 1 more than band 2, leading to a lower ratio. But the question is about the ratio after the stoppage. Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch's contribution is negligible in those bands, so stopping it doesn't change the ratio much. But the answer choices suggest a ratio of 0.1, 0.01, 10, or 1. So one order of magnitude difference. Wait, but I need to recall the energy spectra of solar neutrinos. The main sources are: pp reaction (0.231 MeV), 7Be decay (which is the 862 keV neutrino line), and then the higher energy ones from boron-8 decay (10.6 MeVish). Wait, the 7Be decay produces a neutrino line at about 0.862 MeV. That's in the upper part of band 1 (700-800 keV) and lower part of band 2 (800-900 keV). But the 7Be neutrino is a line at 0.862 MeV. So that would contribute primarily to band 2, but depending on the binning. If the bin is 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV, then the 0.862 MeV line would fall into the 800-900 keV bin. Therefore, band 2 (800-900 keV) has a contribution from the 7Be decay. What about band 1 (700-800 keV)? The pp neutrinos are at 0.231 MeV, so they are too low. The 7Be line is above 800 keV (0.862 MeV). Wait, 0.862 MeV is 862 keV, which is in the 800-900 keV bin. Therefore, band 1 (700-800 keV) may have contributions from other sources. Alternatively, maybe there are other neutrino sources between 0.7-0.8 MeV. Wait, perhaps the pep reaction (which is deuterium formation with two protons and emission of a neutrino) has a higher energy than the main pp. Wait, the pep reaction is another branch of the pp chain. Let me check. The main pp reaction is p + p → D + positron + neutrino, with a neutrino energy up to 0.42 MeV. The pep reaction is p + e+ → neutrino + energy, but I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, maybe there are other neutrino-producing reactions in the pp chain. Wait, the breakdown of solar neutrino fluxes: - pp reaction: 85% of the Sun's power, neutrino energy up to 0.42 MeV. - 7Be decay: about 10%, neutrino energy 0.862 MeV. - 8B decay: about 0.02%, neutrino energy up to 14.6 MeV. - pep reaction: about 1%, neutrino energy up to 1.44 MeV. - 7Be + p → 8B + gamma: but that's part of the chain leading to 8B decay. So the pep reaction produces neutrinos at higher energy, up to 1.44 MeV. Therefore, the 1.44 MeV is higher than 0.9 MeV, so it would be in higher energy bins. Therefore, the 700-800 keV (0.7-0.8 MeV) and 800-900 keV (0.8-0.9 MeV) bins would have: - Band 1 (0.7-0.8 MeV): Maybe the tail end of the 7Be decay line? Wait, 7Be is a monoenergetic line at 0.862 MeV, so it would contribute to the 800-900 keV bin. So maybe band 1 (0.7-0.8 MeV) has lower-energy neutrinos, perhaps from other sources? But the main sources are pp (0.231 MeV), 7Be (0.862 MeV), pep (1.44 MeV), etc. So between 0.7-0.8 MeV, there might not be a strong source. Alternatively, the pp-III branch might produce neutrinos in that range. If the pp-III branch is stopped, then those neutrinos would disappear. But if there isn't a strong source in that range, then maybe band 1 (0.7-0.8 MeV) is dominated by something else. Wait, perhaps the pp-III branch involves a reaction that produces neutrinos with energies in that 0.7-0.9 MeV range. For example, perhaps when heavier nuclei are involved. Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch produces neutrinos via the decay of some intermediate nucleus. Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch is related to the pep reaction. Wait, the pep reaction is a different branch of the pp chain where a proton and electron annihilate, producing a neutrino and photon. But maybe that's not the pp-III branch. Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch is a higher-energy version of the main pp reaction. Wait, perhaps the confusion arises because there are different branching ratios in the pp chain. Let me recall that the pp chain has: 1. pp: most common, 85%, produces neutrino up to 0.42 MeV. 2. pep: rarer, ~1%, produces neutrino up to 1.44 MeV. 3. 7Be + e- → 7Li + neutrino + gamma: but this is part of the pp I branch? Wait, maybe the pp-II and pp-III branches. Wait, maybe pp-II and pp-III are associated with the production of 8B and 7Be. Let me check: The pp chain proceeds as follows: pp-I (dominant): 1. p + p → D + e+ + ν_e (this is the pp reaction, 85% of solar power, ν up to 0.42 MeV) 2. D + p → 3He + gamma 3. 3He + 3He → 4He + 2p pp-II (rare): 1. p + p → D + e+ + ν_e 2. D + p → 3He + gamma 3. 3He + 4He → 7Be + gamma 4. 7Be + p → 8B + gamma 5. 8B → 8Be + e+ + ν_e (ν up to 14.6 MeV) 6. 8Be → 4He + 4He pp-III (rarer): Maybe another branch? Alternatively, maybe pp-III is the 7Be + p → 8B reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is the one that produces the 7Be neutrinos. Wait, in the standard pp-I chain, after step 3He + 3He → 4He + 2p, but maybe if instead of that, there's a branch where 3He fuses with a different nucleus. Alternatively, perhaps pp-III is the production of 7Be through 3He + 4He → 7Be. Then, 7Be decaying would produce the 0.862 MeV neutrino. If the pp-III branch is stopped, then 7Be production would stop, leading to no 0.862 MeV neutrinos. But the 7Be decay is a neutrino line at 0.862 MeV. So if pp-III is stopped, the flux at 0.862 MeV would cease. Therefore, band 2 (800-900 keV) which contains 0.862 MeV would have its flux eliminated if pp-III stops. But the question is about the ratio of band 1 (700-800 keV) to band 2 (800-900 keV). If pp-III is responsible for band 2's flux, and if band 1's flux is from another source, then stopping pp-III would decrease band 2's flux but not band 1's. Therefore, the ratio would increase. However, if both bands are affected by pp-III, but band 1 less so, then the ratio would change. Wait, but according to the standard solar model, the 7Be neutrinos are a monoenergetic line at 0.862 MeV. So they would contribute only to the 800-900 keV bin. Therefore, if the pp-III branch, which produces 7Be, is stopped, then the flux in band 2 would drop. But what about band 1 (700-800 keV)? What produces neutrinos in that energy range? The pp neutrinos are at 0.231 MeV, so they are below 0.7 MeV. The pep reaction produces neutrinos up to 1.44 MeV. So the tail end of the pep spectrum might extend into the 0.7-0.8 MeV range. Similarly, the 7Be line is at 0.862 MeV. So perhaps in band 1, there might be some contribution from the tail end of the 7Be line (if it's an energy resolution issue), but 0.862 MeV is in band 2. Alternatively, perhaps the 7Be line has a finite width, so part of its flux spills into band 1. But if the line is sharp, then all flux is in band 2. Therefore, if the pp-III branch is stopped, which produces the 7Be neutrinos, then band 2 flux would drop. But if band 1's flux is from the tail end of the 7Be line, it would also drop. However, if band 1 is primarily from the pep reaction's spectrum, then only part of band 1 might come from 7Be. Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's try to summarize: - Band 1: 0.7-0.8 MeV. Potential contributions: tail of 7Be line (if 0.862 MeV has a broad spectrum), or part of the pep reaction spectrum (which goes up to 1.44 MeV). - Band 2: 0.8-0.9 MeV. Dominated by the 7Be line at 0.862 MeV. If pp-III is stopped, which produces the 7Be neutrinos, then band 2's flux would go down. If band 1's flux is from pep reaction, which is part of the pp-I branch, then it would continue. Therefore, if pp-III is stopped, and if band 1 is primarily pep and band 2 is 7Be, then the ratio flux(band1)/flux(band2) would increase. But before the shutdown, the ratio would be (pep flux in band1 + 7Be spill in band1) / (7Be flux in band2). After shutdown, it's (pep flux in band1) / 0, but that would be undefined. Wait, but that contradicts. Wait, perhaps the initial ratio (before shutdown) is dominated by pp-III in both bands, but after shutdown, only other reactions (like pep) contribute to band1. Wait, but according to standard solar neutrino fluxes: - The pp reaction (85%) gives 0.231 MeV. - The pep reaction (1%) gives up to 1.44 MeV. - The 7Be decay (10%) gives 0.862 MeV. - The 8B decay (0.02%) gives up to 14.6 MeV. So in band1 (0.7-0.8 MeV): The main contribution would be from the tail end of the pep reaction spectrum. Since pep has a higher endpoint (1.44 MeV), its spectrum is spread out between 1.44 MeV and lower energies, but how low? The neutrino energy spectrum for pep starts at a certain minimum, not zero. Wait, the pep reaction is the fusion of two protons where one emits a positron and neutrino. Wait, no. Wait, the pep reaction is when a proton captures an electron and emits a neutrino, turning into a neutron, then fusing with another proton to form a deuteron. The neutrino from pep has a maximum energy of 1.44 MeV. Therefore, the pep neutrinos have a spectrum from 1.44 MeV down to some lower limit. Therefore, their main contribution is above 1 MeV, but maybe with a tail down to lower energies. But 0.7-0.8 MeV is quite low for pep. Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch produces neutrinos in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range, and stopping it would eliminate that flux. But according to standard branches, the 7Be line is at 0.862 MeV, so that's a line in band2. If pp-III is responsible for that, stopping pp-III would eliminate band2. What about band1? If band1 is produced by pp-III in another transition, but I don't recall such a transition. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch leads to the production of 8B, which has a high-energy neutrino. Wait, maybe the contribution to band1 and band2 comes from different pp branches. Alternatively, maybe the problem is a trick question. If the pp-III branch stops, and the neutrinos we detect now would have been produced 8.5 minutes ago when the pp-III was still active. Wait, but the cessation of pp-III happened 8.5 minutes ago, and neutrinos travel from the Sun's core to Earth in ~2-3 seconds (due to their high speed), but let's say 8 minutes is the light travel time. Therefore, the neutrinos arriving now left the Sun's core 8 minutes ago, so 0.5 minutes after pp-III stopped. Wait, but the question says pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago. So if neutrinos are arriving now, they would have been emitted when pp-III was still active. Therefore, the flux now would still include pp-III contributions. But that contradicts the problem's statement. Wait, perhaps there's a mix-up here. The pp-III branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago. Solar neutrinos take around 30,000 years on average to escape the Sun due to constant absorption and reemission, but the travel time once they are free is about 2-3 seconds. However, if we consider that the flux we detect on Earth is constantly being produced, then stopping pp-III 8.5 minutes ago would mean that the neutrinos arriving now were produced 8.5 minutes ago, just before the shutdown. But given that neutrino production is ongoing, the flux we see would adjust instantly (minus travel time). However, the problem states that neutrinos arrive at Earth 8.5 minutes after being produced. Given that the Sun is about 8 light-minutes away, so the travel time is about 8 minutes. Therefore, if pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago (from Earth's perspective), the neutrinos arriving now would have been emitted 0.5 minutes (30 seconds) after pp-III stopped. Wait, but the problem says "about 8 and a half minutes ago", so maybe approximating the time such that the neutrinos arriving now carry information about the Sun 8.5 minutes in the past. Therefore, if pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, and the neutrinos we are detecting now left the Sun 8 minutes ago (travel time), there is a half-minute overlap? Wait, this is confusing. Let's clarify: If the pp-III branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago (Event A), and neutrinos take 8 minutes to reach Earth (speed close to light, distance of Sun from Earth is about 1.496e8 km, neutrino travel time is ~499 seconds ~8.3 minutes). So when the pp-III branch stops (Event A), the last neutrino produced by pp-III reaches Earth 8 minutes later (Event B). Therefore, at Event B, which is 8.5 minutes after Event A, the flux would have dropped. But the problem says "about 8 and a half minutes ago", so perhaps the cessation of pp-III is recent enough that the drop is just beginning to be observed. But maybe this is overcomplicating. The problem might just want us to assume that immediately after the pp-III branch stops, the flux from pp-III stops as well, regardless of travel time. So the ratio we calculate is based on the current flux (after the stoppage). Therefore, if pp-III contributes to both band1 and band2, then stopping pp-III would reduce both fluxes. If pp-III is the only contributor to those bands, then the ratio would depend on their relative fluxes before. But if pp-III stops, and other processes (like pep) continue, then maybe band1 is primarily from pep, and band2 was primarily from pp-III (7Be). So if pp-III stops, band2 flux drops, while band1 (pep) remains. Therefore, the ratio Flux(band1)/Flux(band2) would increase. For example, if before the shutdown, band1 was 1% (pep) and band2 was 10% (7Be), the ratio would be 0.1. After shutting down pp-III (which was contributing to band2), band2 would be zero, but band1 remains. However, the problem states that all other reactions continue. So if pep is part of the pp-I branch (I need to check that). Wait, the pep reaction is a separate branch. The pp-I is the main proton-proton fusion. The pep reaction (proton-electron proton-proton?) is a different process. Let's recall: In the pp chain: - pp fusion: 99% of the time, leads to pp-I. - 1% of the time, it might go through other branches like pep. But the problem specifies that only pp-III is stopped; pp-I, II, and other reactions continue. So if pep is part of pp-I branch, then maybe it continues. Wait, but maybe pep is another branch. The Standard Model of the Sun's pp chain has: 1. pp-I: main branch, with pp fusion, then D + p → 3He, then 3He + 3He → 4He + 2p. Produces neutrinos from the first step (up to 0.42 MeV). 2. pep (pep stands for proton-electron-proton): in this branch, a proton fuses with an electron to form a neutrino and a neutron, turning into a neutron and emitting a neutrino? Wait, maybe not. Wait, the pep reaction is another branch where two protons fuse, but one emits a positron and neutrino. Wait, no, that's the regular pp reaction. Alternatively, maybe in the proton-proton scattering process, but with a different quantum state. Wait, maybe I need to clarify. The pep reaction (which stands for proton-electron-proton) is a different process where a proton captures an electron to become a neutron, emitting a neutrino. Then, this neutron can fuse with another proton to form deuterium. However, this process, also known as the "electron-capture on proton" has a much higher energy threshold and is not a major source in the Sun. But in any case, maybe the pep reaction is part of the pp-I chain. If pp-III is stopped, but pp-I continues, then pep would continue, producing its neutrinos. Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch is the one that produces the 7Be neutrinos, and the pep reaction is part of pp-I. Therefore, after stopping pp-III, the 7Be neutrino flux (0.862 MeV) would stop, which is in band2. But what about band1 (0.7-0.8 MeV)? If that band was receiving some contribution from pp-III, then stopping pp-III would reduce both band1 and band2. But if band1 is dominated by other sources (like the tail end of pep), then the ratio would change. Alternatively, maybe band1 is primarily from pp-I (the main pp reaction) with some contribution from pp-III. Wait, the main pp reaction produces 0.231 MeV, which is below band1. Unless there's another source. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch produces neutrinos in both band1 and band2, but in different proportions. If pp-III is stopped, the flux in both bands decreases, but band1's flux was more dependent on pp-III, leading to a higher ratio. Wait, but the answer choices are 0.1, 0.01, 10, 1. Suppose before the shutdown: - Flux(band1) = pp-III contribution (say X) + other contributions (Y) - Flux(band2) = pp-III contribution (Z) + maybe some other (W) After shutdown: - Flux(band1) = Y - Flux(band2) = W So the ratio becomes Y / W. If before shutdown, the ratio was (X + Y) / (Z + W). If pp-III is stopped, the ratio changes. But without knowing the actual values, it's hard to tell. However, according to standard solar models: - The main contributors to the 0.7-0.9 MeV range are the 7Be line at 0.862 MeV and possibly the tail end of the pep reaction. If pp-III is the source of the 7Be neutrinos, then stopping pp-III would eliminate the 0.862 MeV line (band2). If band1 is primarily from the tail end of the pep reaction, which continues (since it's part of pp-I), then after pp-III stops, the ratio would be (pep tail) / 0, which is undefined. But since we still receive some flux in band1, maybe it's dominated by something else. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed such that before the pp-III stoppage, both bands have contributions from pp-III and other sources, and after stoppage, only other sources remain. The ratio of those other sources might be 0.1 or 10. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch produces neutrinos in a continuum that overlaps both bands, while other reactions (like pep) produce a spectrum that only affects band1. If pp-III stops, the continuum contribution is removed, leaving only the pep spectrum in band1, which might be lower or higher. But to figure this out, I need to recall the actual energy production in the Sun. Let me think of the solar neutrino fluxes: - pp neutrinos (0.231 MeV): flux ~6.5e10 cm−2 s−1 - pep neutrinos (1.44 MeV): flux ~2e8 cm−2 s−1 - 7Be neutrinos (0.862 MeV): flux ~5e7 cm−2 s−1 - 8B neutrinos (10 MeV): flux ~5e5 cm−2 s−1 So the flux from pp is highest, then pep, then 7Be, then 8B. Now, in band1 (0.7-0.8 MeV): The 7Be line is at 0.862 MeV, which is in band2. So band1 would have a very low flux from 7Be (maybe none if it's a delta function). The pp neutrinos are at 0.231 MeV, so they don't contribute. The pep neutrinos have a maximum energy of 1.44 MeV. Their spectrum is highest near the endpoint (1.44 MeV) and lower at lower energies. So in the 0.7-0.8 MeV range, there would be some contribution from the pep reaction, but it's a small part of their total flux. Similarly, in band2 (0.8-0.9 MeV), there's the 7Be line at 0.862 MeV, plus some contribution from pep's spectrum. Therefore, before the pp-III branch stops: Flux(band1) ≈ pep contribution in 0.7-0.8 MeV + maybe small pp-III continuum? If pp-III is responsible for 7Be, then before shutdown, Flux(band1) ≈ pep(0.7-0.8) Flux(band2) ≈ 7Be(0.862 MeV) + pep(0.8-0.9) So if pp-III stops, then Flux(band2) becomes approximately pep(0.8-0.9), and Flux(band1) remains pep(0.7-0.8). Therefore, the ratio would be [pep(0.7-0.8)] / [pep(0.8-0.9)]. Since the pep spectrum is highest near the endpoint (1.44 MeV), the flux decreases as energy decreases. Therefore, in the 0.7-0.8 MeV range, it's lower than in the 0.8-0.9 MeV range. Therefore, the ratio would be less than 1. Alternatively, since the pep spectrum is higher near 1.44 MeV, the flux in 0.8-0.9 MeV would be higher than in 0.7-0.8 MeV. Therefore, if only pep contributes after pp-III stops, the ratio would be <1. But how much? Let's think: The neutrino flux from pep is a function of energy. For a positronium-like spectrum, the neutrino flux decreases as the energy decreases. However, between 0.7-0.8 MeV and 0.8-0.9 MeV, both bins are in the decreasing part of the spectrum. Since the spectrum is higher at higher energies, the flux in 0.8-0.9 MeV would be lower than at higher energies, but the flux in 0.7-0.8 MeV would be even lower. Therefore, the ratio Flux(0.7-0.8)/Flux(0.8-0.9) would be less than 1. For example, if the flux halves every 0.1 MeV (I'm making up numbers), then from 0.8-0.9 MeV to 0.7-0.8 MeV, which is a decrease of 0.1 MeV, the flux might be half. But this is just a rough guess. Alternatively, since the pep neutrino spectrum is given by dN/dE = k * sqrt(E) * (1 - E/E_max)^n, where E_max is 1.44 MeV. The exact shape would require integrating over the energy range, but without the precise function, it's hard to calculate. But since 0.7-0.8 MeV is further away from the peak (1.44 MeV) than 0.8-0.9 MeV, the flux in 0.7-0.8 would be lower than in 0.8-0.9. Therefore, the ratio would be less than 1. The options are 0.1, 0.01, 10, 1. If it's between 0.7-0.8 and 0.8-0.9, and the spectrum falls off, maybe by an order of magnitude. For example, if the flux in 0.7-0.8 is 10% of that in 0.8-0.9, the ratio would be 0.1. Alternatively, if it falls off more slowly. Alternatively, perhaps the standard model predicts a certain ratio. But since I don't have exact numbers, I need to estimate. Alternatively, consider that before the pp-III stoppage: Flux(band1) ≈ pep(0.7-0.8) + ppIII(0.7-0.8) Flux(band2) ≈ ppIII(7Be) + pep(0.8-0.9) If ppIII

very large number of neutrinos produced by the sun reach the earth (very large flux of neutrinos, defined as the number of neutrinos per cm^2, per second).

let us assume that, hypothetically, the pp-iii branch suddenly stopped in the core of the sun about 8 and a half minutes ago, while all other reactions remained as they were.

what would be the approximate ratio of the flux between two bands of neutrino energies of 700-800 kev (band 1) and 800-900 kev (band 2). 

flux (band 1) / flux (band 2) is:

(note: we are talking about stopping the pp-iii branch, not pp-ii, pp-i or any other. it’s not a typo or something like that.)
(note 2: solar neutrino flavor changes happen, but do not play a role here.)

okay, let's see. the problem is about solar neutrinos and their flux in different energy bands if the pp-iii branch stops. hmm. first, i need to remember how solar neutrinos are produced. i recall that the proton-proton (pp) chain reactions are the main source of energy in the sun, especially in its core. there are different branches of the pp chain. the main one is pp-i, which produces neutrinos at certain energies. then there are pp-ii and pp-iii branches, which are less dominant but contribute to higher energy neutrinos.
let's think in parallel.

1: the pp-i branch, the primary source of solar energy, involves the fusion of two protons to form a deuteron, a positron, and a neutrino. this reaction produces neutrinos with energies up to approximately 0.42 mev. the pp-i branch is responsible for generating the majority of the solar neutrino flux.

the pp-i branch generates neutrinos with energies up to approximately 0.42 mev and is the primary source of the solar neutrino flux. the pp-ii branch produces neutrinos with energies above 1.0 mev, while the pp-iii branch results in the production of neutrinos with an energy of approximately 13.7 mev.

but the question is about neutrino energies between 700-800 kev and 800-900 kev. wait, 700-800 kev is 0.7 to 0.8 mev, and 800-900 kev is 0.8 to 0.9 mev. so neither of these is the 13.7 mev from pp-iii. so why does stopping the pp-iii branch affect these energy ranges?
wait, maybe the pp-iii branch's contribution is not direct, but maybe through some other reactions? wait, perhaps the pp-iii branch is part of a chain that leads to other neutrino-producing reactions. let me think. the pp-iii branch: when two protons collide to form deuterium, helium-3, etc. wait, the pp-i, ii, iii refer to different possible decays. let me check that again.
wait, the pp chain starts with pp fusion into deuterium, emitting a positron and neutrino. that's the pp-i reaction. then, the deuterium can fuse with another proton to form helium-3 (pp-i continues), or it can capture a proton and go into other branches. wait, perhaps pp-ii and pp-iii are branches that involve beryllium and boron? wait, i might be confusing the pp chain with the cno cycle. let me clarify.
the pp chain has these main branches:
1. pp-i: proton + proton → deuterium + positron + neutrino (energy up to ~0.42 mev)
then deuterium + proton → helium-3 + gamma. then helium-3 + helium-3 → helium-4 + 2 protons. but this doesn't produce neutrinos.
2. pp-ii: this branch involves helium-3 from pp-i reacting with a beryllium-7, but i think pp-ii is a much rarer branch. wait, maybe pp-ii and pp-iii are other possible fusions. alternatively, perhaps pp-iii produces a higher-energy neutrino. but the question is about stopping the pp-iii branch, so we need to know what neutrinos that branch produces.
alternatively, maybe the pp-iii neutrinos are in a different energy range, but the question is about the ratio of fluxes in 0.7-0.8 mev and 0.8-0.9 mev. so if pp-iii produces neutrinos above 13 mev, then stopping pp-iii wouldn't affect those energies. therefore, perhaps those energy bands are produced by other reactions, like cno cycle? wait, the cno cycle produces higher-energy neutrinos. but the problem states that only the pp-iii branch stopped, while others continue. so if the 0.7-0.9 mev neutrinos are produced by the pp-iii branch, then stopping it would reduce the flux in those bands. but the question is about the ratio between two bands. wait, the question is: "what would be the approximate ratio of the flux between two bands of neutrino energies of 700-800 kev (band 1) and 800-900 kev (band 2)." then, after the pp-iii branch stops. so if the pp-iii branch produces neutrinos in both bands, but stopping it would decrease the flux in both bands. but since they are asking for the ratio after the branch stops, but maybe the original fluxes (before stopping) are dominated by pp-iii in those energy ranges. then, if you stop pp-iii, the flux in both bands goes down, but perhaps the ratio between them changes. wait, but the question is a touchy after the pp-iii stops. so if pp-iii is stopped, and if those energy bands (0.7-0.8 mev and 0.8-0.9 mev) are primarily from pp-iii, then their flux would go to zero. but the ratio would be zero flux in both, but the ratio is undefined. that can't be. therefore, perhaps other reactions contribute to those energy bands as well. for example, the cno cycle produces neutrinos around 1.5 mev, i think. so maybe those two bands (0.7-0.8 and 0.8-0.9 mev) are from lower-energy branches of the pp chain.
wait, pp-i produces up to 0.42 mev. so maybe higher energy neutrinos in pp chain require other branches. wait, perhaps there are other neutrino sources between 0.7-0.9 mev. let's see. the decay of boron-8 into beryllium-8 produces neutrinos around 7-8 mev, but that's in the sun's core. wait, no, boron-8 decay produces a neutrino with an energy up to 14.7 mev. that's way higher. alternatively, maybe there are proton-electron scattering events or something else. wait, maybe the pp-iii branch produces neutrinos in the 0.7-0.9 mev range. if that is the case, then stopping the pp-iii branch would eliminate that flux, leading to a ratio of zero. but the options are 0.1, 0.01, 10, 1. so zero isn't an option. wait, but the question says "hypothetically, the pp-iii branch suddenly stopped... about 8 and a half minutes ago". the neutrinos travel from the sun's core to earth in about 8 minutes (since they travel at nearly the speed of light). so if the pp-iii branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos reaching earth now would have been emitted 8.5 minutes ago. therefore, the flux now would reflect the pp-iii branch already stopped. so if pp-iii contributes to the 0.7-0.9 mev bands, the flux in those bands would immediately drop when pp-iii stops. however, other reactions (like pp-i) continue. but if pp-iii is stopped, how does that affect the flux in those two bands? the ratio of band 1 to band 2 after pp-iii is stopped.
alternatively, maybe the pp-iii branch produces neutrinos in both bands, but with different efficiencies. for example, maybe pp-iii produces more neutrinos in band 1 (0.7-0.8 mev) than in band 2 (0.8-0.9 mev), so stopping pp-iii would reduce band 1 more than band 2, leading to a lower ratio. but the question is about the ratio after the stoppage. alternatively, maybe the pp-iii branch's contribution is negligible in those bands, so stopping it doesn't change the ratio much. but the answer choices suggest a ratio of 0.1, 0.01, 10, or 1. so one order of magnitude difference. wait, but i need to recall the energy spectra of solar neutrinos. the main sources are: pp reaction (0.231 mev), 7be decay (which is the 862 kev neutrino line), and then the higher energy ones from boron-8 decay (10.6 mevish). wait, the 7be decay produces a neutrino line at about 0.862 mev. that's in the upper part of band 1 (700-800 kev) and lower part of band 2 (800-900 kev). but the 7be neutrino is a line at 0.862 mev. so that would contribute primarily to band 2, but depending on the binning. if the bin is 700-800 kev and 800-900 kev, then the 0.862 mev line would fall into the 800-900 kev bin. therefore, band 2 (800-900 kev) has a contribution from the 7be decay. what about band 1 (700-800 kev)? the pp neutrinos are at 0.231 mev, so they are too low. the 7be line is above 800 kev (0.862 mev). wait, 0.862 mev is 862 kev, which is in the 800-900 kev bin. therefore, band 1 (700-800 kev) may have contributions from other sources. alternatively, maybe there are other neutrino sources between 0.7-0.8 mev. wait, perhaps the pep reaction (which is deuterium formation with two protons and emission of a neutrino) has a higher energy than the main pp. wait, the pep reaction is another branch of the pp chain. let me check. the main pp reaction is p + p → d + positron + neutrino, with a neutrino energy up to 0.42 mev. the pep reaction is p + e+ → neutrino + energy, but i might be mixing things up. alternatively, maybe there are other neutrino-producing reactions in the pp chain. wait, the breakdown of solar neutrino fluxes: - pp reaction: 85% of the sun's power, neutrino energy up to 0.42 mev. - 7be decay: about 10%, neutrino energy 0.862 mev. - 8b decay: about 0.02%, neutrino energy up to 14.6 mev. - pep reaction: about 1%, neutrino energy up to 1.44 mev. - 7be + p → 8b + gamma: but that's part of the chain leading to 8b decay. so the pep reaction produces neutrinos at higher energy, up to 1.44 mev. therefore, the 1.44 mev is higher than 0.9 mev, so it would be in higher energy bins. therefore, the 700-800 kev (0.7-0.8 mev) and 800-900 kev (0.8-0.9 mev) bins would have: - band 1 (0.7-0.8 mev): maybe the tail end of the 7be decay line? wait, 7be is a monoenergetic line at 0.862 mev, so it would contribute to the 800-900 kev bin. so maybe band 1 (0.7-0.8 mev) has lower-energy neutrinos, perhaps from other sources? but the main sources are pp (0.231 mev), 7be (0.862 mev), pep (1.44 mev), etc. so between 0.7-0.8 mev, there might not be a strong source. alternatively, the pp-iii branch might produce neutrinos in that range. if the pp-iii branch is stopped, then those neutrinos would disappear. but if there isn't a strong source in that range, then maybe band 1 (0.7-0.8 mev) is dominated by something else. wait, perhaps the pp-iii branch involves a reaction that produces neutrinos with energies in that 0.7-0.9 mev range. for example, perhaps when heavier nuclei are involved. alternatively, maybe the pp-iii branch produces neutrinos via the decay of some intermediate nucleus. alternatively, maybe the pp-iii branch is related to the pep reaction. wait, the pep reaction is a different branch of the pp chain where a proton and electron annihilate, producing a neutrino and photon. but maybe that's not the pp-iii branch. alternatively, maybe the pp-iii branch is a higher-energy version of the main pp reaction. wait, perhaps the confusion arises because there are different branching ratios in the pp chain. let me recall that the pp chain has: 1. pp: most common, 85%, produces neutrino up to 0.42 mev. 2. pep: rarer, ~1%, produces neutrino up to 1.44 mev. 3. 7be + e- → 7li + neutrino + gamma: but this is part of the pp i branch? wait, maybe the pp-ii and pp-iii branches. wait, maybe pp-ii and pp-iii are associated with the production of 8b and 7be. let me check: the pp chain proceeds as follows: pp-i (dominant): 1. p + p → d + e+ + ν_e (this is the pp reaction, 85% of solar power, ν up to 0.42 mev) 2. d + p → 3he + gamma 3. 3he + 3he → 4he + 2p pp-ii (rare): 1. p + p → d + e+ + ν_e 2. d + p → 3he + gamma 3. 3he + 4he → 7be + gamma 4. 7be + p → 8b + gamma 5. 8b → 8be + e+ + ν_e (ν up to 14.6 mev) 6. 8be → 4he + 4he pp-iii (rarer): maybe another branch? alternatively, maybe pp-iii is the 7be + p → 8b reaction. alternatively, perhaps the pp-iii branch is the one that produces the 7be neutrinos. wait, in the standard pp-i chain, after step 3he + 3he → 4he + 2p, but maybe if instead of that, there's a branch where 3he fuses with a different nucleus. alternatively, perhaps pp-iii is the production of 7be through 3he + 4he → 7be. then, 7be decaying would produce the 0.862 mev neutrino. if the pp-iii branch is stopped, then 7be production would stop, leading to no 0.862 mev neutrinos. but the 7be decay is a neutrino line at 0.862 mev. so if pp-iii is stopped, the flux at 0.862 mev would cease. therefore, band 2 (800-900 kev) which contains 0.862 mev would have its flux eliminated if pp-iii stops. but the question is about the ratio of band 1 (700-800 kev) to band 2 (800-900 kev). if pp-iii is responsible for band 2's flux, and if band 1's flux is from another source, then stopping pp-iii would decrease band 2's flux but not band 1's. therefore, the ratio would increase. however, if both bands are affected by pp-iii, but band 1 less so, then the ratio would change. wait, but according to the standard solar model, the 7be neutrinos are a monoenergetic line at 0.862 mev. so they would contribute only to the 800-900 kev bin. therefore, if the pp-iii branch, which produces 7be, is stopped, then the flux in band 2 would drop. but what about band 1 (700-800 kev)? what produces neutrinos in that energy range? the pp neutrinos are at 0.231 mev, so they are below 0.7 mev. the pep reaction produces neutrinos up to 1.44 mev. so the tail end of the pep spectrum might extend into the 0.7-0.8 mev range. similarly, the 7be line is at 0.862 mev. so perhaps in band 1, there might be some contribution from the tail end of the 7be line (if it's an energy resolution issue), but 0.862 mev is in band 2. alternatively, perhaps the 7be line has a finite width, so part of its flux spills into band 1. but if the line is sharp, then all flux is in band 2. therefore, if the pp-iii branch is stopped, which produces the 7be neutrinos, then band 2 flux would drop. but if band 1's flux is from the tail end of the 7be line, it would also drop. however, if band 1 is primarily from the pep reaction's spectrum, then only part of band 1 might come from 7be. wait, this is getting complicated. let's try to summarize: - band 1: 0.7-0.8 mev. potential contributions: tail of 7be line (if 0.862 mev has a broad spectrum), or part of the pep reaction spectrum (which goes up to 1.44 mev). - band 2: 0.8-0.9 mev. dominated by the 7be line at 0.862 mev. if pp-iii is stopped, which produces the 7be neutrinos, then band 2's flux would go down. if band 1's flux is from pep reaction, which is part of the pp-i branch, then it would continue. therefore, if pp-iii is stopped, and if band 1 is primarily pep and band 2 is 7be, then the ratio flux(band1)/flux(band2) would increase. but before the shutdown, the ratio would be (pep flux in band1 + 7be spill in band1) / (7be flux in band2). after shutdown, it's (pep flux in band1) / 0, but that would be undefined. wait, but that contradicts. wait, perhaps the initial ratio (before shutdown) is dominated by pp-iii in both bands, but after shutdown, only other reactions (like pep) contribute to band1. wait, but according to standard solar neutrino fluxes: - the pp reaction (85%) gives 0.231 mev. - the pep reaction (1%) gives up to 1.44 mev. - the 7be decay (10%) gives 0.862 mev. - the 8b decay (0.02%) gives up to 14.6 mev. so in band1 (0.7-0.8 mev): the main contribution would be from the tail end of the pep reaction spectrum. since pep has a higher endpoint (1.44 mev), its spectrum is spread out between 1.44 mev and lower energies, but how low? the neutrino energy spectrum for pep starts at a certain minimum, not zero. wait, the pep reaction is the fusion of two protons where one emits a positron and neutrino. wait, no. wait, the pep reaction is when a proton captures an electron and emits a neutrino, turning into a neutron, then fusing with another proton to form a deuteron. the neutrino from pep has a maximum energy of 1.44 mev. therefore, the pep neutrinos have a spectrum from 1.44 mev down to some lower limit. therefore, their main contribution is above 1 mev, but maybe with a tail down to lower energies. but 0.7-0.8 mev is quite low for pep. alternatively, maybe there's a mistake here. alternatively, maybe the pp-iii branch produces neutrinos in the 0.7-0.9 mev range, and stopping it would eliminate that flux. but according to standard branches, the 7be line is at 0.862 mev, so that's a line in band2. if pp-iii is responsible for that, stopping pp-iii would eliminate band2. what about band1? if band1 is produced by pp-iii in another transition, but i don't recall such a transition. alternatively, perhaps the pp-iii branch leads to the production of 8b, which has a high-energy neutrino. wait, maybe the contribution to band1 and band2 comes from different pp branches. alternatively, maybe the problem is a trick question. if the pp-iii branch stops, and the neutrinos we detect now would have been produced 8.5 minutes ago when the pp-iii was still active. wait, but the cessation of pp-iii happened 8.5 minutes ago, and neutrinos travel from the sun's core to earth in ~2-3 seconds (due to their high speed), but let's say 8 minutes is the light travel time. therefore, the neutrinos arriving now left the sun's core 8 minutes ago, so 0.5 minutes after pp-iii stopped. wait, but the question says pp-iii stopped 8.5 minutes ago. so if neutrinos are arriving now, they would have been emitted when pp-iii was still active. therefore, the flux now would still include pp-iii contributions. but that contradicts the problem's statement. wait, perhaps there's a mix-up here. the pp-iii branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago. solar neutrinos take around 30,000 years on average to escape the sun due to constant absorption and reemission, but the travel time once they are free is about 2-3 seconds. however, if we consider that the flux we detect on earth is constantly being produced, then stopping pp-iii 8.5 minutes ago would mean that the neutrinos arriving now were produced 8.5 minutes ago, just before the shutdown. but given that neutrino production is ongoing, the flux we see would adjust instantly (minus travel time). however, the problem states that neutrinos arrive at earth 8.5 minutes after being produced. given that the sun is about 8 light-minutes away, so the travel time is about 8 minutes. therefore, if pp-iii stopped 8.5 minutes ago (from earth's perspective), the neutrinos arriving now would have been emitted 0.5 minutes (30 seconds) after pp-iii stopped. wait, but the problem says "about 8 and a half minutes ago", so maybe approximating the time such that the neutrinos arriving now carry information about the sun 8.5 minutes in the past. therefore, if pp-iii stopped 8.5 minutes ago, and the neutrinos we are detecting now left the sun 8 minutes ago (travel time), there is a half-minute overlap? wait, this is confusing. let's clarify: if the pp-iii branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago (event a), and neutrinos take 8 minutes to reach earth (speed close to light, distance of sun from earth is about 1.496e8 km, neutrino travel time is ~499 seconds ~8.3 minutes). so when the pp-iii branch stops (event a), the last neutrino produced by pp-iii reaches earth 8 minutes later (event b). therefore, at event b, which is 8.5 minutes after event a, the flux would have dropped. but the problem says "about 8 and a half minutes ago", so perhaps the cessation of pp-iii is recent enough that the drop is just beginning to be observed. but maybe this is overcomplicating. the problem might just want us to assume that immediately after the pp-iii branch stops, the flux from pp-iii stops as well, regardless of travel time. so the ratio we calculate is based on the current flux (after the stoppage). therefore, if pp-iii contributes to both band1 and band2, then stopping pp-iii would reduce both fluxes. if pp-iii is the only contributor to those bands, then the ratio would depend on their relative fluxes before. but if pp-iii stops, and other processes (like pep) continue, then maybe band1 is primarily from pep, and band2 was primarily from pp-iii (7be). so if pp-iii stops, band2 flux drops, while band1 (pep) remains. therefore, the ratio flux(band1)/flux(band2) would increase. for example, if before the shutdown, band1 was 1% (pep) and band2 was 10% (7be), the ratio would be 0.1. after shutting down pp-iii (which was contributing to band2), band2 would be zero, but band1 remains. however, the problem states that all other reactions continue. so if pep is part of the pp-i branch (i need to check that). wait, the pep reaction is a separate branch. the pp-i is the main proton-proton fusion. the pep reaction (proton-electron proton-proton?) is a different process. let's recall: in the pp chain: - pp fusion: 99% of the time, leads to pp-i. - 1% of the time, it might go through other branches like pep. but the problem specifies that only pp-iii is stopped; pp-i, ii, and other reactions continue. so if pep is part of pp-i branch, then maybe it continues. wait, but maybe pep is another branch. the standard model of the sun's pp chain has: 1. pp-i: main branch, with pp fusion, then d + p → 3he, then 3he + 3he → 4he + 2p. produces neutrinos from the first step (up to 0.42 mev). 2. pep (pep stands for proton-electron-proton): in this branch, a proton fuses with an electron to form a neutrino and a neutron, turning into a neutron and emitting a neutrino? wait, maybe not. wait, the pep reaction is another branch where two protons fuse, but one emits a positron and neutrino. wait, no, that's the regular pp reaction. alternatively, maybe in the proton-proton scattering process, but with a different quantum state. wait, maybe i need to clarify. the pep reaction (which stands for proton-electron-proton) is a different process where a proton captures an electron to become a neutron, emitting a neutrino. then, this neutron can fuse with another proton to form deuterium. however, this process, also known as the "electron-capture on proton" has a much higher energy threshold and is not a major source in the sun. but in any case, maybe the pep reaction is part of the pp-i chain. if pp-iii is stopped, but pp-i continues, then pep would continue, producing its neutrinos. alternatively, maybe the pp-iii branch is the one that produces the 7be neutrinos, and the pep reaction is part of pp-i. therefore, after stopping pp-iii, the 7be neutrino flux (0.862 mev) would stop, which is in band2. but what about band1 (0.7-0.8 mev)? if that band was receiving some contribution from pp-iii, then stopping pp-iii would reduce both band1 and band2. but if band1 is dominated by other sources (like the tail end of pep), then the ratio would change. alternatively, maybe band1 is primarily from pp-i (the main pp reaction) with some contribution from pp-iii. wait, the main pp reaction produces 0.231 mev, which is below band1. unless there's another source. alternatively, perhaps the pp-iii branch produces neutrinos in both band1 and band2, but in different proportions. if pp-iii is stopped, the flux in both bands decreases, but band1's flux was more dependent on pp-iii, leading to a higher ratio. wait, but the answer choices are 0.1, 0.01, 10, 1. suppose before the shutdown: - flux(band1) = pp-iii contribution (say x) + other contributions (y) - flux(band2) = pp-iii contribution (z) + maybe some other (w) after shutdown: - flux(band1) = y - flux(band2) = w so the ratio becomes y / w. if before shutdown, the ratio was (x + y) / (z + w). if pp-iii is stopped, the ratio changes. but without knowing the actual values, it's hard to tell. however, according to standard solar models: - the main contributors to the 0.7-0.9 mev range are the 7be line at 0.862 mev and possibly the tail end of the pep reaction. if pp-iii is the source of the 7be neutrinos, then stopping pp-iii would eliminate the 0.862 mev line (band2). if band1 is primarily from the tail end of the pep reaction, which continues (since it's part of pp-i), then after pp-iii stops, the ratio would be (pep tail) / 0, which is undefined. but since we still receive some flux in band1, maybe it's dominated by something else. alternatively, maybe the problem is designed such that before the pp-iii stoppage, both bands have contributions from pp-iii and other sources, and after stoppage, only other sources remain. the ratio of those other sources might be 0.1 or 10. alternatively, perhaps the pp-iii branch produces neutrinos in a continuum that overlaps both bands, while other reactions (like pep) produce a spectrum that only affects band1. if pp-iii stops, the continuum contribution is removed, leaving only the pep spectrum in band1, which might be lower or higher. but to figure this out, i need to recall the actual energy production in the sun. let me think of the solar neutrino fluxes: - pp neutrinos (0.231 mev): flux ~6.5e10 cm−2 s−1 - pep neutrinos (1.44 mev): flux ~2e8 cm−2 s−1 - 7be neutrinos (0.862 mev): flux ~5e7 cm−2 s−1 - 8b neutrinos (10 mev): flux ~5e5 cm−2 s−1 so the flux from pp is highest, then pep, then 7be, then 8b. now, in band1 (0.7-0.8 mev): the 7be line is at 0.862 mev, which is in band2. so band1 would have a very low flux from 7be (maybe none if it's a delta function). the pp neutrinos are at 0.231 mev, so they don't contribute. the pep neutrinos have a maximum energy of 1.44 mev. their spectrum is highest near the endpoint (1.44 mev) and lower at lower energies. so in the 0.7-0.8 mev range, there would be some contribution from the pep reaction, but it's a small part of their total flux. similarly, in band2 (0.8-0.9 mev), there's the 7be line at 0.862 mev, plus some contribution from pep's spectrum. therefore, before the pp-iii branch stops: flux(band1) ≈ pep contribution in 0.7-0.8 mev + maybe small pp-iii continuum? if pp-iii is responsible for 7be, then before shutdown, flux(band1) ≈ pep(0.7-0.8) flux(band2) ≈ 7be(0.862 mev) + pep(0.8-0.9) so if pp-iii stops, then flux(band2) becomes approximately pep(0.8-0.9), and flux(band1) remains pep(0.7-0.8). therefore, the ratio would be [pep(0.7-0.8)] / [pep(0.8-0.9)]. since the pep spectrum is highest near the endpoint (1.44 mev), the flux decreases as energy decreases. therefore, in the 0.7-0.8 mev range, it's lower than in the 0.8-0.9 mev range. therefore, the ratio would be less than 1. alternatively, since the pep spectrum is higher near 1.44 mev, the flux in 0.8-0.9 mev would be higher than in 0.7-0.8 mev. therefore, if only pep contributes after pp-iii stops, the ratio would be <1. but how much? let's think: the neutrino flux from pep is a function of energy. for a positronium-like spectrum, the neutrino flux decreases as the energy decreases. however, between 0.7-0.8 mev and 0.8-0.9 mev, both bins are in the decreasing part of the spectrum. since the spectrum is higher at higher energies, the flux in 0.8-0.9 mev would be lower than at higher energies, but the flux in 0.7-0.8 mev would be even lower. therefore, the ratio flux(0.7-0.8)/flux(0.8-0.9) would be less than 1. for example, if the flux halves every 0.1 mev (i'm making up numbers), then from 0.8-0.9 mev to 0.7-0.8 mev, which is a decrease of 0.1 mev, the flux might be half. but this is just a rough guess. alternatively, since the pep neutrino spectrum is given by dn/de = k * sqrt(e) * (1 - e/e_max)^n, where e_max is 1.44 mev. the exact shape would require integrating over the energy range, but without the precise function, it's hard to calculate. but since 0.7-0.8 mev is further away from the peak (1.44 mev) than 0.8-0.9 mev, the flux in 0.7-0.8 would be lower than in 0.8-0.9. therefore, the ratio would be less than 1. the options are 0.1, 0.01, 10, 1. if it's between 0.7-0.8 and 0.8-0.9, and the spectrum falls off, maybe by an order of magnitude. for example, if the flux in 0.7-0.8 is 10% of that in 0.8-0.9, the ratio would be 0.1. alternatively, if it falls off more slowly. alternatively, perhaps the standard model predicts a certain ratio. but since i don't have exact numbers, i need to estimate. alternatively, consider that before the pp-iii stoppage: flux(band1) ≈ pep(0.7-0.8) + ppiii(0.7-0.8) flux(band2) ≈ ppiii(7be) + pep(0.8-0.9) if ppiii
