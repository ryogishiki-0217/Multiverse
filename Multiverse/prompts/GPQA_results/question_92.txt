Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step.
The question is asking for the enthalpy of formation of the compound (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.
Hmm, that's a pretty complex structure.
Let me first draw the structure to understand how many bonds are present.
The compound has two double bonds, one between the second and third carbon atoms and another between the fifth and sixth carbon atoms.
Each of these double bonds will have a C=C bond.
Let me count the number of each type of bond in the molecule.
Starting from the left:
First carbon: (CH3)2C=CH-.
So, the first carbon is part of a (CH3)2 group attached to a C=C double bond.
Let's see:
The structure is a cumulated diene?
Wait, no.
Wait, (CH3)2C=CH- is a substituted propene.
Then that's connected to CH2-, then CH(CH3)-, then CH2-, and then another CH=C(CH3)2.
Let's break it down.
First part: (CH3)2C=CH-.
This is like isopropenyl group.
The central carbon (C2) is double-bonded to C3, and has two methyl groups attached.
Then C3 is single-bonded to C4 (CH2-), which is single-bonded to C5 (CH(CH3)-), which is single-bonded to C6 (CH2-), which is double-bonded to C7 (another C=C bond), which is part of another (CH3)2C group.
Wait, maybe numbering the carbons will help.
Let me try:
1: part of (CH3)2C=
2: the other part of the =CH- group.
So, positions 1 and 2 are double-bonded.
Then comes CH2 (position 3), then CH(CH3) (position 4), then CH2 (position 5), and then another CH=C(CH3)2 starting at position 6 and 7.
Wait, maybe not.
Let me think again.
The structure is:
(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.
So, breaking into parts:
1. (CH3)2C=CH- : Here, the first carbon (C1) has two CH3 groups and is double-bonded to C2.
Then C2 is single-bonded to C3.
2. CH2- : C3 is connected to C4 via a single bond, and C3 has two H atoms.
3. CH(CH3)- : C4 has a CH3 group and is connected to C5.
4. CH2- : C5 is connected to C6 via a single bond, and has two H atoms.
5. CH=C(CH3)2 : C6 is double-bonded to C7, which has two CH3 groups.
So, the molecule has two C=C double bonds: one between C2 and C3, and another between C6 and C7.
Wait, no.
Wait, first double bond is between C1 and C2.
Then the second part is between C6 and C7 (the CH=C in the -CH=C(CH3)2 group).
So two C=C bonds.
Also, there are several C-C single bonds and C-H bonds.
Let's count all bonds.
First, let's figure out the total number of each type of bond in the molecule.
Enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the formula:
ΔHf = Σ ΔHf (atoms) - Σ BE (bonds formed)
But wait, the problem gives the enthalpy of atomization of carbon and bond energies.
Wait, the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a substance in its standard state is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states.
So, to calculate this, we can use the bond energies.
The formula is:
ΔHf = (Σ BE bonds broken in elements) - (Σ BE bonds formed in compound)
But wait, the enthalpy of atomization of carbon is given.
The enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to convert one mole of a substance into gaseous atoms.
For carbon, which is in the form of graphite (or possibly diamond?
Wait, but the problem specifies the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol.
Let me note that down.
Given data:
Enthalpy of atomization of C: 1000 kJ/mol.
Bond energies:
H-H: 100 kJ/mol
C-C: 200 kJ/mol
C=C: 300 kJ/mol
C-H: 400 kJ/mol
Wait, the user wrote "Bond energy of C-H = 100 kJ/mol" but in standard tables, C-H bond energy is around 400 kJ/mol.
Wait, wait, maybe that's a typo in the problem.
Wait, no, the user specified:
Bond energy of H-H = 100 kJ/mol
Bond energy of C-C = 200 kJ/mol
Bond energy of C=C = 300 kJ/mol
Bond energy of C-H = 100 kJ/mol
Wait, okay, but that seems really low for C-H.
Typically, H-H is 436 kJ/mol, C-C is 348 kJ/mol, C=C is 614 kJ/mol, and C-H is 413 kJ/mol.
But since the problem gives different values, perhaps it's a made-up scenario.
So in this problem's universe, H-H is 100, C-C is 200, C=C is 300, and C-H is 100.
Wait, that seems fishy.
Wait, maybe I misread.
Wait, the problem says:
Enthalpy of atomization of carbon = 1000 kJ/mol.
Bond energy of H-H = 100 kJ/mol
Bond energy of C-C = 200 kJ/mol
Bond energy of C=C = 300 kJ/mol
Bond energy of C-H = 400 kJ/mol
Wait, maybe the user corrected the C-H bond energy to 400?
Let me check again.
Original problem statement says C-H bond energy is 100 kJ/mol.
Wait, no, user wrote:
Given,
Enthalpy of atomization of carbon = 1000 kJ/mol.
Bond energy of H-H = 100 kJ/mol
Bond energy of C-C = 200 kJ/mol
Bond energy of C=C = 300 kJ/mol
Bond energy of C-H = 400 kJ/mol
Ah, okay, so the bond energies are:
H-H: 100
C-C: 200
C=C: 300
C-H: 400
Got it.
So proceeding with these values.
First, we need to calculate the enthalpy of formation of the given compound.
The compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.
To compute the enthalpy of formation using bond energies, we need to consider the difference between the energy required to break the bonds in the elements and the energy released in forming the bonds in the compound.
The formula is:
ΔHf = (1/2) * Σ BE (bonds broken in elements) - Σ BE (bonds formed in compound)
But wait, actually, the standard enthalpy of formation can be calculated using:
ΔHf° = (Σ BE(bonds broken) - Σ BE(bonds formed)) / 2
But considering that when elements combine, the bonds in the elements are broken (e.g., H-H, C-C in graphite? ), and then bonds in the compound are formed.
Wait, but carbon in its standard state is graphite, which is a lattice of six-membered rings with each carbon bonded to three others, so the bond energy concept is a bit different.
However, the problem gives the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol.
That is, the energy required to convert one mole of carbon (graphite) into gaseous carbon atoms is 1000 kJ/mol.
So perhaps we need to use that instead of considering C-C bonds in graphite.
Similarly, hydrogen exists as H2, so to break H-H bonds would require energy.
So, the formula for enthalpy of formation using bond energies is:
ΔHf = (number of bonds broken in elements * their BE) - (number of bonds formed in compound * their BE)
But considering that for each mole of element, the bonds are broken.
For example, for H2, each mole has H-H bonds, so per mole of H2, it's 100 kJ/mol (as given in the problem).
But in reality, when forming a compound, the elemental bonds broken would be calculated based on the number of moles of each element required.
But perhaps an easier way is to use the standard formula for calculating enthalpy of formation via bond energies:
ΔHf = (Σ [BE of bonds broken in elements] - Σ [BE of bonds formed in compound]) / 2
But I need to verify.
Wait, the standard equation is:
ΔH° = (Σ BE reactants) - Σ BE products) / 2
But for enthalpy of formation, the reaction is elements in their standard state → compound.
So, the ΔHf° would be:
ΔHf° = (Σ BE bonds broken in elements) - Σ BE bonds formed in compound)) / 2
But why divide by two?
Because each bond is shared between two atoms, so the total bond energy is counted twice.
Wait, actually, the formula is:
ΔHf° = (1/2) * [Σ BE(bonds broken in elements) - Σ BE(bonds formed in molecule)]
Yes, that's right.
So we need to calculate:
1. The total energy required to break the bonds in the elemental forms (C and H2) to provide the necessary atoms.
2. The total energy released in forming the bonds in the compound.
Then, ΔHf° = (1/2) * [Σ BE(bonds broken in elements) - Σ BE(bonds formed in compound)]
But first, we need to determine how many moles of each element (C and H2) are required to form one mole of the compound.
Let's determine the molecular formula of the compound (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.
Let me count the number of carbons and hydrogens.
Breaking down the structure:
- (CH3)2C=CH- : This part has 1 (C=CH) + 2 (from (CH3)2) = 3 C from the first group.
Wait, (CH3)2C=CH-:
The (CH3)2 group is two CH3 groups on a central carbon, which is double-bonded to another carbon.
So, the structure is:
C(C2H5)=CH- (but that's not correct nomenclature, but structurally):
Actually, the first carbon (C1) is bonded to two CH3 groups and double-bonded to C2.
Then C2 is single-bonded to C3.
Then C3 is CH2-, connected to C4 (CH(CH3)-), which is connected to C5 (CH2-), which is connected to C6, which is double-bonded to C7 (another C=C bond), which is part of another (CH3)2C group.
So let's count the carbons step by step:
1. (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2
Breaking into parts:
- (CH3)2C=CH- : Here, the first carbon (C1) has two CH3 groups (each CH3 has 1 C), so that's 1 + 2 = 3 C.
Then C2 (part of =CH-) and C3 (from CH2-), so up to C3 here.
- CH2-CH(CH3)- : C4 is CH2 (but wait, the previous was C3 as CH2, then C4 would be the CH(CH3)-.
Let's re-examine:
After (CH3)2C=CH- (positions C1, C2, C3), then CH2- (C4), then CH(CH3)- (C5), then CH2- (C6), then CH=C(CH3)2 (C7 and C8?).
Wait, perhaps the structure is:
Positions:
1: (CH3)2C= (two CH3 groups and a double bond to C2)
2: =CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2
Wait, maybe it's better to write the entire structure as:
C(C2H5)=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(C2H5)-
But perhaps a more accurate way:
The compound is a hexene derivative with two methyl groups on each end.
Wait, actually, let me consider the structure again:
The full structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.
So, each end has a (CH3)2C=CH- group and a -CH=C(CH3)2 group, but connected by -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.
Wait, no.
Let's actually number the carbons from left to right:
1: Part of (CH3)2C= (so C1 is double-bonded to C2 and has two CH3 groups)
2: =CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2
Wait, C2 is single-bonded to C3 (part of -CH2-), C3 is single-bonded to C4 (which is CH(CH3)-), meaning C4 has a CH3 group attached.
Then C4 is connected to C5 (which is CH2-), so C5 has two H atoms.
C5 is connected to C6, which is double-bonded to C7 via CH=, and C7 has two CH3 groups.
Wait, so the structure from left to right:
C1 [(CH3)2C] double-bonded to C2 [CH-], then C3 [CH2-], C4 [CH(CH3)-], C5 [CH2-], C6 [CH=], and C7 [C(CH3)2].
Wait, but C6 is part of the double bond, so perhaps C6 is connected to C7 via a double bond.
Let me confirm:
The structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.
So starting from left:
1. (CH3)2C= (C1 with two CH3 groups and a double bond to C2)
2. CH- (C2)
3. CH2- (C3)
4. CH(CH3)- (C4 with a CH3 group)
5. CH2- (C5)
6. CH= (C6)
7. C(CH3)2 (C7 with two CH3 groups)
But wait, then C6 and C7 form a double bond.
Therefore, the structure has two double bonds: one between C1 and C2, and another between C6 and C7.
So in total, two C=C double bonds.
Now, let's count the number of carbon atoms:
Each CH3 group contributes 1 carbon.
Let's go step by step:
- (CH3)2C=CH-: Here, the (CH3)2 contributes two C atoms (each CH3 is one C), then the C=CH- is another two C atoms (C1 and C2).
Wait, no.
Wait, (CH3)2C is one carbon with two CH3 groups, then the C= is the same carbon double-bonded to C2 (another carbon).
So from (CH3)2C=CH-, we have C1 (with two CH3 groups and double-bonded to C2), C2 (single-bonded to C3), then:
- CH2- (C3)
- CH(CH3)- (C4)
- CH2- (C5)
- CH= (C6)
- C(CH3)2 (C7)
Therefore, total carbons:
C1 (with two CH3 groups), C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7.
Each CH3 group is an additional carbon.
So:
C1 is part of (CH3)2C=CH-, and has two CH3 groups attached.
So each CH3 is a carbon, so those are two more carbons.
But C1 itself is another carbon.
Similarly, at the end, C7 has two CH3 groups attached.
So:
Total carbons:
- C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7: 7 carbons from the main chain.
- Two CH3 groups on C1: 2 more carbons.
- One CH3 group on C4: 1 more carbon.
- Two CH3 groups on C7: 2 more carbons.
Total carbons = 7 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 12.
So the molecular formula has 12 C atoms.
Now, let's count the number of H atoms.
Each carbon not in a methyl group has a certain number of H atoms.
Let's go step by step:
1. C1: Part of (CH3)2C=. It has two CH3 groups, so no additional H atoms.
2. C2: =CH-CH2-... So C2 is part of the double bond (C1=C2), and has one H atom (as it's =CH-).
Wait, no.
Wait, (CH3)2C=CH-: Here, C1 is double-bonded to C2, and C2 is single-bonded to C3 (which is CH2-).
But in the =CH- group, C2 is bonded to C1 (double bond), bonded to C3 (single bond), and has two H atoms?
Wait, no.
Wait, in the structure (CH3)2C=CH-, the C2 is bonded to C1 via a double bond and has two H atoms.
Then it's bonded to C3 via a single bond.
Wait, no.
If it's (CH3)2C=CH-, then the structure is a cumulated diene?
Wait, no.
Wait, in the structure (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-..., the part (CH3)2C=CH- is a substituted propene.
So, C1 is part of (CH3)2C=, which is a CH2 group with two CH3 substituents and a double bond to C2.
Wait, maybe I'm confusing the nomenclature.
Alternatively, perhaps (CH3)2C=CH- is correct as a structure where C1 has two CH3 groups and a double bond to C2, and C2 has two H atoms.
Then C2 is bonded to C3 (CH2-).
Let me check:
If the structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-..., then the first part is similar to isopropenyl group.
The structure would be:
C(CH2CH3)=CH-...?
Wait, maybe not.
Let's take another approach.
Each carbon's bonding needs to be satisfied.
So, let's consider each carbon atom:
1. C1: Part of (CH3)2C=.
This carbon is bonded to two CH3 groups and has a double bond to C2.
Therefore, it has two methyl groups and a double bond to C2, so no more H atoms.
2. C2: Double-bonded to C1 and single-bonded to C3.
So, how many H atoms?
Since it's =CH-CH2-..., the C2 is part of =CH-.
So in this case, C2 is bonded to C1 (double bond), C3 (single bond), and has two H atoms.
Therefore, C2 has two H atoms.
3. C3: Part of -CH2-CH(CH3)-...
So C3 is bonded to C2 and C4, with two H atoms.
4. C4: Part of -CH(CH3)-CH2-...
So C4 is bonded to C3, C5, and has a CH3 group.
Therefore, C4 has one CH3 group and a single bond to C5.
Since each carbon needs four bonds, C4 is bonded to C3, C5, has one CH3 group, and one H atom.
Wait, no.
If C4 is CH(CH3)-, then it's bonded to C3, C5, has a CH3 group, and needs one more bond, which would be a H atom.
So C4 has one H atom and one CH3 group.
5. C5: Part of -CH2-CH=...
So C5 is bonded to C4, C6, and has two H atoms.
6. C6: Part of -CH=CH-...
Wait, in the structure, after C5 is CH2-CH=C..., so:
The part -CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.
So, C5 is CH2 (bonded to C4 and C6), then C6 is CH=, which is bonded to C7 with a double bond.
So C6 is bonded to C5, C7, and has one H atom.
Wait, no.
Let's see:
The structure ends with -CH=C(CH3)2.
So, C6 is bonded to C5 (via a single bond), double-bonded to C7, and has one CH3 group?
Wait, no.
Wait, -CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.
So, starting from C5:
C5 is CH2- (bonded to C4 and C6), then C6 is part of CH=C(CH3)2.
Therefore, C6 is bonded to C5 (single bond), double-bonded to C7, and has two CH3 groups?
Wait, no.
Wait, the structure is:
...CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.
So the last part is -CH2-CH=CH(CH3)-?
Wait, no.
Wait, maybe it's -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.
So:
C5 is connected to C4 and C6 via CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=.
Wait, let's parse the entire structure again:
Original structure: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.
Breaking it down:
1. (CH3)2C=CH-: Four carbon atoms? Wait:
Wait, (CH3)2C is one carbon with two methyl groups, then =CH- is a double bond to another carbon (C2) which has two H atoms.
So that's C1, C2.
Then -CH2- is C3, then -CH(CH3)- is C4, then -CH2- is C5, then -CH= is C6, then C7 with two methyl groups.
Wait, no.
Let's re-evaluate:
The structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.
1. (CH3)2C=CH-: This is four carbon atoms?
Wait:
Let's think of it as:
- (CH3)2C=CH-: The first carbon (C1) has two CH3 groups and a double bond to C2.
Then C2 (CH-) has two H atoms and a single bond to C3 (CH2-).
Then C3 is connected to C4 (CH(CH3)-).
C4 is connected to C5 (CH2-).
Then C5 is connected to C6 (CH=).
C6 is double-bonded to C7 (C(CH3)2).
Wait, no.
Wait, let's count each part:
(CH3)2C=CH- (positions 1, 2, 3, 4??)
Wait, perhaps this is getting too confusing.
Let me instead consider each structural unit:
- (CH3)2C=CH-: This unit starts with a carbon (C1) that has two CH3 groups and a double bond to C2.
Then C2 is =CH-, which implies C2 is bonded to C1 via a double bond, and has one H and a single bond to C3.
Wait, no.
If it's (CH3)2C=CH-, the structure is actually:
C1 (two CH3 groups and a double bond to C2), then C2 is =CH-, meaning C2 is bonded to C1 via double bond, has one H atom, and a single bond to C3.
So:
C1: two CH3 groups, one double bond to C2.
C2: double bond to C1, one H atom, single bond to C3.
Then C3 is part of -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.
So:
C3: single bond to C2, single bond to C4, and two H atoms.
C4: single bond to C3, single bond to C5, a CH3 group, and one H atom.
Wait, because the unit is -CH2-CH(CH3)-.
So C3 is CH2 (two H atoms), connected to C4 which is CH(CH3) (one CH3 group and one H atom).
Then C4 is connected to C5 which is CH2 (two H atoms), connected to C6 which is CH= (one H atom) connected via a double bond to C7.
Wait, the end group is -CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.
So starting from C5:
C5 is CH2 (two H atoms) connected to C6 (CH=), which has one H atom and a double bond to C7.
C7 has two CH3 groups.
Therefore, C6 is CH=, meaning one H atom and a double bond to C7.
So putting it all together:
Carbon atoms:
1. C1: Part of (CH3)2C=, so two CH3 groups, double bond to C2.
2. C2: =CH-CH2-..., so double bond to C1, one H atom, single bond to C3.
3. C3: CH2-CH(CH3)-..., single bonds to C2 and C4, two H atoms.
4. C4: CH(CH3)-CH2-..., single bonds to C3 and C5, one CH3 group, one H atom.
5. C5: CH2-CH=..., single bonds to C4 and C6, two H atoms.
6. C6: CH=CH=C(CH3)2, but wait, the actual end is -CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.
So after C5 (CH2-), comes C6 (CH=), which is double-bonded to C7 (C(CH3)2).
So C6 has one H atom and a double bond to C7.
7. C7: Double-bonded to C6 and has two CH3 groups.
Now, let's count H atoms:
C1: Part of (CH3)2C=, no additional H atoms.
C2: 1 H atom.
C3: 2 H atoms.
C4: 1 H atom (since it has a CH3 group).
C5: 2 H atoms.
C6: 1 H atom.
C7: Part of C(CH3)2, no additional H atoms.
Additionally, each CH3 group has 3 H atoms.
There are:
- Two CH3 groups on C1: 2 * 3 = 6 H.
- One CH3 group on C4: 1 * 3 = 3 H.
- Two CH3 groups on C7: 2 * 3 = 6 H.
Total H from CH3 groups: 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 H.
Now, the other H atoms from the main chain:
C2: 1 H
C3: 2 H
C4: 1 H
C5: 2 H
C6: 1 H
Total: 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 7 H.
Total H atoms in the molecule: 15 (from CH3 groups) + 7 (from main chain) = 22 H.
Therefore, the molecular formula is C12H22.
Wait, 12 carbons and 22 hydrogens.
Let me verify:
Earlier, we counted 12 carbons.
Hydrogens:
Each of the 12 carbons normally has 4 bonds.
Total bonds: 12 * 4 = 48.
Each bond is shared by two atoms, so actual bonds: 48 / 2 = 24 bonds.
But some of these are C-C bonds, some are C-H bonds.
But to find H atoms:
Total H atoms = total valence electrons from H - (number of C-H bonds * 1)...
Wait, no.
Alternatively, each C must have its bonds accounted for.
Wait, maybe an easier way.
Since we have the molecular formula as C12H22, then the formula is correct.
Now, to compute the enthalpy of formation using bond energies.
Given:
Enthalpy of atomization of carbon = 1000 kJ/mol.
Bond energy of H-H = 100 kJ/mol
Bond energy of C-C (single bond) = 200 kJ/mol
Bond energy of C=C (double bond) = 300 kJ/mol
Bond energy of C-H = 400 kJ/mol
First, we need to calculate the energy required to break the bonds in the elements (C and H2) and then subtract the energy released when the bonds in the molecule are formed.
But the standard approach is:
ΔHf° = [n(C * enthalpy of atomization) + (n/2 H2 * bond energy H-H)] - [Σ (bond energies of bonds formed in molecule)]
Wait, but actually, the formula is:
ΔHf° = (1/2) [Σ BE(bonds broken in elements) - Σ BE(bonds formed in molecule)]
But here, for carbon, the enthalpy of atomization is given as 1000 kJ/mol.
The enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to convert one mole of a substance into gaseous atoms.
So for carbon, which exists as solid graphite, the atomization enthalpy is 1000 kJ/mol.
That is, the energy needed to convert 1 mol of graphite into 1 mol of C(g) atoms.
For hydrogen, the bond energy of H-H (100 kJ/mol) is the energy required to break H2 into H atoms.
So, per mole of H2, it's 100 kJ.
Since each H2 molecule has one H-H bond, the energy to break one mole of H-H bonds is 100 kJ.
Now, the molecule has 12 C atoms and 22 H atoms.
So, to form one mole of the molecule, we need 12 moles of C atoms and 22/2 = 11 moles of H2 molecules (since each H2 provides 2 H atoms).
But wait, no.
The formula is C12H22, so per mole of the compound, there are 12 C atoms and 22 H atoms, which come from 11 H2 molecules (22 H / 2 H per H2 = 11).
Therefore, energy required to break the elemental bonds:
Energy for C: 12 * 1000 kJ/mol = 12,000 kJ
Energy for H2: 11 * 100 kJ/mol = 1,100 kJ
Total energy to break bonds in elements: 12,000 + 1,100 = 13,100 kJ
Now, the energy released when bonds form in the molecule:
The molecule has:
- C-C single bonds
- C=C double bonds
- C-H bonds
Let's count each:
First, let's count the number of each bond in the molecule.
Total bonds in the molecule:
Each carbon has four bonds.
Total bonds = (12 * 4) / 2 = 24 bonds.
But we need to categorize them into C-C, C=C, and C-H.
First, the molecule has two double bonds (C=C), so that's two C=C bonds.
Each double bond counts as one C=C bond (but in terms of bond energy, a double bond has a certain value).
Wait, no.
The bond energy given for C=C is 300 kJ/mol (probably per mole of bonds).
Each double bond in the molecule would correspond to one C=C bond.
So, each C=C bond is considered as one bond (even though chemically it consists of a sigma and pi bond).
So, in the molecule, there are two C=C bonds.
Therefore, the number of C=C bonds is two.
Then, the remaining bonds are C-C single bonds and C-H bonds.
Total number of bonds: 24.
Number of C=C bonds: 2.
So remaining bonds: 24 - 2 = 22.
These 22 bonds are either C-C single bonds or C-H bonds.
Let's count the number of C-H bonds first.
The molecule has 22 H atoms, each involved in a C-H bond.
Therefore, there are 22 C-H bonds.
Therefore, the remaining bonds are C-C single bonds.
So total bonds: 24.
C=C bonds: 2.
C-H bonds: 22.
Therefore, C-C single bonds: 24 - 2 - 22 = 0?
Wait, that can't be.
Wait, hold on.
This must be wrong.
Wait, total bonds in the molecule:
Each of the 12 carbons forms 4 bonds each.
Total bonds: (12 * 4) / 2 = 24.
Bonds in the molecule:
- Two C=C double bonds (counted as two bonds)
- 22 C-H bonds (since there are 22 H atoms)
So total bonds: 2 + 22 = 24.
Therefore, there are no C-C single bonds?
That doesn't seem right.
Wait, that must be incorrect.
There must be some C-C single bonds.
Let me re-examine the structure.
Wait, in the molecule, each carbon is connected to other carbons either by single or double bonds.
Let me consider the structure again.
The molecule has two double bonds (C1=C2 and C6=C7).
The remaining carbon atoms are connected by single bonds.
Let's see:
Carbon chain connections:
From left to right:
C1=C2-C3-C4-C5-C6=C7.
Then, each of these carbons (C1, C2, ..., C7) has various substituents (methyl groups).
But the backbone is C1=C2-C3-C4-C5-C6=C7.
So, between C2 and C3: single bond.
Between C3 and C4: single bond.
Between C4 and C5: single bond.
Between C5 and C6: single bond.
Between C6 and C7: double bond.
Therefore, in the backbone, there are four single bonds (C2-C3, C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6) and two double bonds (C1-C2 and C6-C7).
Additionally, each of these carbons also has bonds to hydrogen or methyl groups.
So, the number of C-C single bonds in the molecule is 4 (backbone single bonds) plus any single bonds from branches.
However, the only branches are the methyl groups on C1, C4, C7.
Let's check:
- C1 has two methyl groups (which are -CH3, so each CH3 is attached via a single bond to C1).
- C4 has one methyl group (-CH3), attached via a single bond to C4.
- C7 has two methyl groups, each attached via a single bond to C7.
Therefore, the single bonds from branches are:

okay, let's tackle this problem step by step.
the question is asking for the enthalpy of formation of the compound (ch3)2c=ch-ch2-ch(ch3)-ch2-ch=c(ch3)2.
hmm, that's a pretty complex structure.
let me first draw the structure to understand how many bonds are present.
the compound has two double bonds, one between the second and third carbon atoms and another between the fifth and sixth carbon atoms.
each of these double bonds will have a c=c bond.
let me count the number of each type of bond in the molecule.
starting from the left:
first carbon: (ch3)2c=ch-.
so, the first carbon is part of a (ch3)2 group attached to a c=c double bond.
let's see:
the structure is a cumulated diene?
wait, no.
wait, (ch3)2c=ch- is a substituted propene.
then that's connected to ch2-, then ch(ch3)-, then ch2-, and then another ch=c(ch3)2.
let's break it down.
first part: (ch3)2c=ch-.
this is like isopropenyl group.
the central carbon (c2) is double-bonded to c3, and has two methyl groups attached.
then c3 is single-bonded to c4 (ch2-), which is single-bonded to c5 (ch(ch3)-), which is single-bonded to c6 (ch2-), which is double-bonded to c7 (another c=c bond), which is part of another (ch3)2c group.
wait, maybe numbering the carbons will help.
let me try:
1: part of (ch3)2c=
2: the other part of the =ch- group.
so, positions 1 and 2 are double-bonded.
then comes ch2 (position 3), then ch(ch3) (position 4), then ch2 (position 5), and then another ch=c(ch3)2 starting at position 6 and 7.
wait, maybe not.
let me think again.
the structure is:
(ch3)2c=ch-ch2-ch(ch3)-ch2-ch=c(ch3)2.
so, breaking into parts:
1. (ch3)2c=ch- : here, the first carbon (c1) has two ch3 groups and is double-bonded to c2.
then c2 is single-bonded to c3.
2. ch2- : c3 is connected to c4 via a single bond, and c3 has two h atoms.
3. ch(ch3)- : c4 has a ch3 group and is connected to c5.
4. ch2- : c5 is connected to c6 via a single bond, and has two h atoms.
5. ch=c(ch3)2 : c6 is double-bonded to c7, which has two ch3 groups.
so, the molecule has two c=c double bonds: one between c2 and c3, and another between c6 and c7.
wait, no.
wait, first double bond is between c1 and c2.
then the second part is between c6 and c7 (the ch=c in the -ch=c(ch3)2 group).
so two c=c bonds.
also, there are several c-c single bonds and c-h bonds.
let's count all bonds.
first, let's figure out the total number of each type of bond in the molecule.
enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the formula:
δhf = σ δhf (atoms) - σ be (bonds formed)
but wait, the problem gives the enthalpy of atomization of carbon and bond energies.
wait, the enthalpy of formation (δhf°) is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a substance in its standard state is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states.
so, to calculate this, we can use the bond energies.
the formula is:
δhf = (σ be bonds broken in elements) - (σ be bonds formed in compound)
but wait, the enthalpy of atomization of carbon is given.
the enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to convert one mole of a substance into gaseous atoms.
for carbon, which is in the form of graphite (or possibly diamond?
wait, but the problem specifies the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kj/mol.
let me note that down.
given data:
enthalpy of atomization of c: 1000 kj/mol.
bond energies:
h-h: 100 kj/mol
c-c: 200 kj/mol
c=c: 300 kj/mol
c-h: 400 kj/mol
wait, the user wrote "bond energy of c-h = 100 kj/mol" but in standard tables, c-h bond energy is around 400 kj/mol.
wait, wait, maybe that's a typo in the problem.
wait, no, the user specified:
bond energy of h-h = 100 kj/mol
bond energy of c-c = 200 kj/mol
bond energy of c=c = 300 kj/mol
bond energy of c-h = 100 kj/mol
wait, okay, but that seems really low for c-h.
typically, h-h is 436 kj/mol, c-c is 348 kj/mol, c=c is 614 kj/mol, and c-h is 413 kj/mol.
but since the problem gives different values, perhaps it's a made-up scenario.
so in this problem's universe, h-h is 100, c-c is 200, c=c is 300, and c-h is 100.
wait, that seems fishy.
wait, maybe i misread.
wait, the problem says:
enthalpy of atomization of carbon = 1000 kj/mol.
bond energy of h-h = 100 kj/mol
bond energy of c-c = 200 kj/mol
bond energy of c=c = 300 kj/mol
bond energy of c-h = 400 kj/mol
wait, maybe the user corrected the c-h bond energy to 400?
let me check again.
original problem statement says c-h bond energy is 100 kj/mol.
wait, no, user wrote:
given,
enthalpy of atomization of carbon = 1000 kj/mol.
bond energy of h-h = 100 kj/mol
bond energy of c-c = 200 kj/mol
bond energy of c=c = 300 kj/mol
bond energy of c-h = 400 kj/mol
ah, okay, so the bond energies are:
h-h: 100
c-c: 200
c=c: 300
c-h: 400
got it.
so proceeding with these values.
first, we need to calculate the enthalpy of formation of the given compound.
the compound is (ch3)2c=ch-ch2-ch(ch3)-ch2-ch=c(ch3)2.
to compute the enthalpy of formation using bond energies, we need to consider the difference between the energy required to break the bonds in the elements and the energy released in forming the bonds in the compound.
the formula is:
δhf = (1/2) * σ be (bonds broken in elements) - σ be (bonds formed in compound)
but wait, actually, the standard enthalpy of formation can be calculated using:
δhf° = (σ be(bonds broken) - σ be(bonds formed)) / 2
but considering that when elements combine, the bonds in the elements are broken (e.g., h-h, c-c in graphite? ), and then bonds in the compound are formed.
wait, but carbon in its standard state is graphite, which is a lattice of six-membered rings with each carbon bonded to three others, so the bond energy concept is a bit different.
however, the problem gives the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kj/mol.
that is, the energy required to convert one mole of carbon (graphite) into gaseous carbon atoms is 1000 kj/mol.
so perhaps we need to use that instead of considering c-c bonds in graphite.
similarly, hydrogen exists as h2, so to break h-h bonds would require energy.
so, the formula for enthalpy of formation using bond energies is:
δhf = (number of bonds broken in elements * their be) - (number of bonds formed in compound * their be)
but considering that for each mole of element, the bonds are broken.
for example, for h2, each mole has h-h bonds, so per mole of h2, it's 100 kj/mol (as given in the problem).
but in reality, when forming a compound, the elemental bonds broken would be calculated based on the number of moles of each element required.
but perhaps an easier way is to use the standard formula for calculating enthalpy of formation via bond energies:
δhf = (σ [be of bonds broken in elements] - σ [be of bonds formed in compound]) / 2
but i need to verify.
wait, the standard equation is:
δh° = (σ be reactants) - σ be products) / 2
but for enthalpy of formation, the reaction is elements in their standard state → compound.
so, the δhf° would be:
δhf° = (σ be bonds broken in elements) - σ be bonds formed in compound)) / 2
but why divide by two?
because each bond is shared between two atoms, so the total bond energy is counted twice.
wait, actually, the formula is:
δhf° = (1/2) * [σ be(bonds broken in elements) - σ be(bonds formed in molecule)]
yes, that's right.
so we need to calculate:
1. the total energy required to break the bonds in the elemental forms (c and h2) to provide the necessary atoms.
2. the total energy released in forming the bonds in the compound.
then, δhf° = (1/2) * [σ be(bonds broken in elements) - σ be(bonds formed in compound)]
but first, we need to determine how many moles of each element (c and h2) are required to form one mole of the compound.
let's determine the molecular formula of the compound (ch3)2c=ch-ch2-ch(ch3)-ch2-ch=c(ch3)2.
let me count the number of carbons and hydrogens.
breaking down the structure:
- (ch3)2c=ch- : this part has 1 (c=ch) + 2 (from (ch3)2) = 3 c from the first group.
wait, (ch3)2c=ch-:
the (ch3)2 group is two ch3 groups on a central carbon, which is double-bonded to another carbon.
so, the structure is:
c(c2h5)=ch- (but that's not correct nomenclature, but structurally):
actually, the first carbon (c1) is bonded to two ch3 groups and double-bonded to c2.
then c2 is single-bonded to c3.
then c3 is ch2-, connected to c4 (ch(ch3)-), which is connected to c5 (ch2-), which is connected to c6, which is double-bonded to c7 (another c=c bond), which is part of another (ch3)2c group.
so let's count the carbons step by step:
1. (ch3)2c=ch-ch2-ch(ch3)-ch2-ch=c(ch3)2
breaking into parts:
- (ch3)2c=ch- : here, the first carbon (c1) has two ch3 groups (each ch3 has 1 c), so that's 1 + 2 = 3 c.
then c2 (part of =ch-) and c3 (from ch2-), so up to c3 here.
- ch2-ch(ch3)- : c4 is ch2 (but wait, the previous was c3 as ch2, then c4 would be the ch(ch3)-.
let's re-examine:
after (ch3)2c=ch- (positions c1, c2, c3), then ch2- (c4), then ch(ch3)- (c5), then ch2- (c6), then ch=c(ch3)2 (c7 and c8?).
wait, perhaps the structure is:
positions:
1: (ch3)2c= (two ch3 groups and a double bond to c2)
2: =ch-ch2-ch(ch3)-ch2-ch=c(ch3)2
wait, maybe it's better to write the entire structure as:
c(c2h5)=ch-ch2-ch(ch3)-ch2-ch=c(c2h5)-
but perhaps a more accurate way:
the compound is a hexene derivative with two methyl groups on each end.
wait, actually, let me consider the structure again:
the full structure is (ch3)2c=ch-ch2-ch(ch3)-ch2-ch=c(ch3)2.
so, each end has a (ch3)2c=ch- group and a -ch=c(ch3)2 group, but connected by -ch2-ch(ch3)-ch2-.
wait, no.
let's actually number the carbons from left to right:
1: part of (ch3)2c= (so c1 is double-bonded to c2 and has two ch3 groups)
2: =ch-ch2-ch(ch3)-ch2-ch=c(ch3)2
wait, c2 is single-bonded to c3 (part of -ch2-), c3 is single-bonded to c4 (which is ch(ch3)-), meaning c4 has a ch3 group attached.
then c4 is connected to c5 (which is ch2-), so c5 has two h atoms.
c5 is connected to c6, which is double-bonded to c7 via ch=, and c7 has two ch3 groups.
wait, so the structure from left to right:
c1 [(ch3)2c] double-bonded to c2 [ch-], then c3 [ch2-], c4 [ch(ch3)-], c5 [ch2-], c6 [ch=], and c7 [c(ch3)2].
wait, but c6 is part of the double bond, so perhaps c6 is connected to c7 via a double bond.
let me confirm:
the structure is (ch3)2c=ch-ch2-ch(ch3)-ch2-ch=c(ch3)2.
so starting from left:
1. (ch3)2c= (c1 with two ch3 groups and a double bond to c2)
2. ch- (c2)
3. ch2- (c3)
4. ch(ch3)- (c4 with a ch3 group)
5. ch2- (c5)
6. ch= (c6)
7. c(ch3)2 (c7 with two ch3 groups)
but wait, then c6 and c7 form a double bond.
therefore, the structure has two double bonds: one between c1 and c2, and another between c6 and c7.
so in total, two c=c double bonds.
now, let's count the number of carbon atoms:
each ch3 group contributes 1 carbon.
let's go step by step:
- (ch3)2c=ch-: here, the (ch3)2 contributes two c atoms (each ch3 is one c), then the c=ch- is another two c atoms (c1 and c2).
wait, no.
wait, (ch3)2c is one carbon with two ch3 groups, then the c= is the same carbon double-bonded to c2 (another carbon).
so from (ch3)2c=ch-, we have c1 (with two ch3 groups and double-bonded to c2), c2 (single-bonded to c3), then:
- ch2- (c3)
- ch(ch3)- (c4)
- ch2- (c5)
- ch= (c6)
- c(ch3)2 (c7)
therefore, total carbons:
c1 (with two ch3 groups), c2, c3, c4, c5, c6, c7.
each ch3 group is an additional carbon.
so:
c1 is part of (ch3)2c=ch-, and has two ch3 groups attached.
so each ch3 is a carbon, so those are two more carbons.
but c1 itself is another carbon.
similarly, at the end, c7 has two ch3 groups attached.
so:
total carbons:
- c1, c2, c3, c4, c5, c6, c7: 7 carbons from the main chain.
- two ch3 groups on c1: 2 more carbons.
- one ch3 group on c4: 1 more carbon.
- two ch3 groups on c7: 2 more carbons.
total carbons = 7 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 12.
so the molecular formula has 12 c atoms.
now, let's count the number of h atoms.
each carbon not in a methyl group has a certain number of h atoms.
let's go step by step:
1. c1: part of (ch3)2c=. it has two ch3 groups, so no additional h atoms.
2. c2: =ch-ch2-... so c2 is part of the double bond (c1=c2), and has one h atom (as it's =ch-).
wait, no.
wait, (ch3)2c=ch-: here, c1 is double-bonded to c2, and c2 is single-bonded to c3 (which is ch2-).
but in the =ch- group, c2 is bonded to c1 (double bond), bonded to c3 (single bond), and has two h atoms?
wait, no.
wait, in the structure (ch3)2c=ch-, the c2 is bonded to c1 via a double bond and has two h atoms.
then it's bonded to c3 via a single bond.
wait, no.
if it's (ch3)2c=ch-, then the structure is a cumulated diene?
wait, no.
wait, in the structure (ch3)2c=ch-ch2-..., the part (ch3)2c=ch- is a substituted propene.
so, c1 is part of (ch3)2c=, which is a ch2 group with two ch3 substituents and a double bond to c2.
wait, maybe i'm confusing the nomenclature.
alternatively, perhaps (ch3)2c=ch- is correct as a structure where c1 has two ch3 groups and a double bond to c2, and c2 has two h atoms.
then c2 is bonded to c3 (ch2-).
let me check:
if the structure is (ch3)2c=ch-ch2-..., then the first part is similar to isopropenyl group.
the structure would be:
c(ch2ch3)=ch-...?
wait, maybe not.
let's take another approach.
each carbon's bonding needs to be satisfied.
so, let's consider each carbon atom:
1. c1: part of (ch3)2c=.
this carbon is bonded to two ch3 groups and has a double bond to c2.
therefore, it has two methyl groups and a double bond to c2, so no more h atoms.
2. c2: double-bonded to c1 and single-bonded to c3.
so, how many h atoms?
since it's =ch-ch2-..., the c2 is part of =ch-.
so in this case, c2 is bonded to c1 (double bond), c3 (single bond), and has two h atoms.
therefore, c2 has two h atoms.
3. c3: part of -ch2-ch(ch3)-...
so c3 is bonded to c2 and c4, with two h atoms.
4. c4: part of -ch(ch3)-ch2-...
so c4 is bonded to c3, c5, and has a ch3 group.
therefore, c4 has one ch3 group and a single bond to c5.
since each carbon needs four bonds, c4 is bonded to c3, c5, has one ch3 group, and one h atom.
wait, no.
if c4 is ch(ch3)-, then it's bonded to c3, c5, has a ch3 group, and needs one more bond, which would be a h atom.
so c4 has one h atom and one ch3 group.
5. c5: part of -ch2-ch=...
so c5 is bonded to c4, c6, and has two h atoms.
6. c6: part of -ch=ch-...
wait, in the structure, after c5 is ch2-ch=c..., so:
the part -ch2-ch=c(ch3)2.
so, c5 is ch2 (bonded to c4 and c6), then c6 is ch=, which is bonded to c7 with a double bond.
so c6 is bonded to c5, c7, and has one h atom.
wait, no.
let's see:
the structure ends with -ch=c(ch3)2.
so, c6 is bonded to c5 (via a single bond), double-bonded to c7, and has one ch3 group?
wait, no.
wait, -ch2-ch=c(ch3)2.
so, starting from c5:
c5 is ch2- (bonded to c4 and c6), then c6 is part of ch=c(ch3)2.
therefore, c6 is bonded to c5 (single bond), double-bonded to c7, and has two ch3 groups?
wait, no.
wait, the structure is:
...ch2-ch(ch3)-ch2-ch=c(ch3)2.
so the last part is -ch2-ch=ch(ch3)-?
wait, no.
wait, maybe it's -ch2-ch(ch3)-ch2-ch=c(ch3)2.
so:
c5 is connected to c4 and c6 via ch2-ch(ch3)-ch2-ch=.
wait, let's parse the entire structure again:
original structure: (ch3)2c=ch-ch2-ch(ch3)-ch2-ch=c(ch3)2.
breaking it down:
1. (ch3)2c=ch-: four carbon atoms? wait:
wait, (ch3)2c is one carbon with two methyl groups, then =ch- is a double bond to another carbon (c2) which has two h atoms.
so that's c1, c2.
then -ch2- is c3, then -ch(ch3)- is c4, then -ch2- is c5, then -ch= is c6, then c7 with two methyl groups.
wait, no.
let's re-evaluate:
the structure is (ch3)2c=ch-ch2-ch(ch3)-ch2-ch=c(ch3)2.
1. (ch3)2c=ch-: this is four carbon atoms?
wait:
let's think of it as:
- (ch3)2c=ch-: the first carbon (c1) has two ch3 groups and a double bond to c2.
then c2 (ch-) has two h atoms and a single bond to c3 (ch2-).
then c3 is connected to c4 (ch(ch3)-).
c4 is connected to c5 (ch2-).
then c5 is connected to c6 (ch=).
c6 is double-bonded to c7 (c(ch3)2).
wait, no.
wait, let's count each part:
(ch3)2c=ch- (positions 1, 2, 3, 4??)
wait, perhaps this is getting too confusing.
let me instead consider each structural unit:
- (ch3)2c=ch-: this unit starts with a carbon (c1) that has two ch3 groups and a double bond to c2.
then c2 is =ch-, which implies c2 is bonded to c1 via a double bond, and has one h and a single bond to c3.
wait, no.
if it's (ch3)2c=ch-, the structure is actually:
c1 (two ch3 groups and a double bond to c2), then c2 is =ch-, meaning c2 is bonded to c1 via double bond, has one h atom, and a single bond to c3.
so:
c1: two ch3 groups, one double bond to c2.
c2: double bond to c1, one h atom, single bond to c3.
then c3 is part of -ch2-ch(ch3)-ch2-ch=c(ch3)2.
so:
c3: single bond to c2, single bond to c4, and two h atoms.
c4: single bond to c3, single bond to c5, a ch3 group, and one h atom.
wait, because the unit is -ch2-ch(ch3)-.
so c3 is ch2 (two h atoms), connected to c4 which is ch(ch3) (one ch3 group and one h atom).
then c4 is connected to c5 which is ch2 (two h atoms), connected to c6 which is ch= (one h atom) connected via a double bond to c7.
wait, the end group is -ch2-ch=c(ch3)2.
so starting from c5:
c5 is ch2 (two h atoms) connected to c6 (ch=), which has one h atom and a double bond to c7.
c7 has two ch3 groups.
therefore, c6 is ch=, meaning one h atom and a double bond to c7.
so putting it all together:
carbon atoms:
1. c1: part of (ch3)2c=, so two ch3 groups, double bond to c2.
2. c2: =ch-ch2-..., so double bond to c1, one h atom, single bond to c3.
3. c3: ch2-ch(ch3)-..., single bonds to c2 and c4, two h atoms.
4. c4: ch(ch3)-ch2-..., single bonds to c3 and c5, one ch3 group, one h atom.
5. c5: ch2-ch=..., single bonds to c4 and c6, two h atoms.
6. c6: ch=ch=c(ch3)2, but wait, the actual end is -ch2-ch=c(ch3)2.
so after c5 (ch2-), comes c6 (ch=), which is double-bonded to c7 (c(ch3)2).
so c6 has one h atom and a double bond to c7.
7. c7: double-bonded to c6 and has two ch3 groups.
now, let's count h atoms:
c1: part of (ch3)2c=, no additional h atoms.
c2: 1 h atom.
c3: 2 h atoms.
c4: 1 h atom (since it has a ch3 group).
c5: 2 h atoms.
c6: 1 h atom.
c7: part of c(ch3)2, no additional h atoms.
additionally, each ch3 group has 3 h atoms.
there are:
- two ch3 groups on c1: 2 * 3 = 6 h.
- one ch3 group on c4: 1 * 3 = 3 h.
- two ch3 groups on c7: 2 * 3 = 6 h.
total h from ch3 groups: 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 h.
now, the other h atoms from the main chain:
c2: 1 h
c3: 2 h
c4: 1 h
c5: 2 h
c6: 1 h
total: 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 7 h.
total h atoms in the molecule: 15 (from ch3 groups) + 7 (from main chain) = 22 h.
therefore, the molecular formula is c12h22.
wait, 12 carbons and 22 hydrogens.
let me verify:
earlier, we counted 12 carbons.
hydrogens:
each of the 12 carbons normally has 4 bonds.
total bonds: 12 * 4 = 48.
each bond is shared by two atoms, so actual bonds: 48 / 2 = 24 bonds.
but some of these are c-c bonds, some are c-h bonds.
but to find h atoms:
total h atoms = total valence electrons from h - (number of c-h bonds * 1)...
wait, no.
alternatively, each c must have its bonds accounted for.
wait, maybe an easier way.
since we have the molecular formula as c12h22, then the formula is correct.
now, to compute the enthalpy of formation using bond energies.
given:
enthalpy of atomization of carbon = 1000 kj/mol.
bond energy of h-h = 100 kj/mol
bond energy of c-c (single bond) = 200 kj/mol
bond energy of c=c (double bond) = 300 kj/mol
bond energy of c-h = 400 kj/mol
first, we need to calculate the energy required to break the bonds in the elements (c and h2) and then subtract the energy released when the bonds in the molecule are formed.
but the standard approach is:
δhf° = [n(c * enthalpy of atomization) + (n/2 h2 * bond energy h-h)] - [σ (bond energies of bonds formed in molecule)]
wait, but actually, the formula is:
δhf° = (1/2) [σ be(bonds broken in elements) - σ be(bonds formed in molecule)]
but here, for carbon, the enthalpy of atomization is given as 1000 kj/mol.
the enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to convert one mole of a substance into gaseous atoms.
so for carbon, which exists as solid graphite, the atomization enthalpy is 1000 kj/mol.
that is, the energy needed to convert 1 mol of graphite into 1 mol of c(g) atoms.
for hydrogen, the bond energy of h-h (100 kj/mol) is the energy required to break h2 into h atoms.
so, per mole of h2, it's 100 kj.
since each h2 molecule has one h-h bond, the energy to break one mole of h-h bonds is 100 kj.
now, the molecule has 12 c atoms and 22 h atoms.
so, to form one mole of the molecule, we need 12 moles of c atoms and 22/2 = 11 moles of h2 molecules (since each h2 provides 2 h atoms).
but wait, no.
the formula is c12h22, so per mole of the compound, there are 12 c atoms and 22 h atoms, which come from 11 h2 molecules (22 h / 2 h per h2 = 11).
therefore, energy required to break the elemental bonds:
energy for c: 12 * 1000 kj/mol = 12,000 kj
energy for h2: 11 * 100 kj/mol = 1,100 kj
total energy to break bonds in elements: 12,000 + 1,100 = 13,100 kj
now, the energy released when bonds form in the molecule:
the molecule has:
- c-c single bonds
- c=c double bonds
- c-h bonds
let's count each:
first, let's count the number of each bond in the molecule.
total bonds in the molecule:
each carbon has four bonds.
total bonds = (12 * 4) / 2 = 24 bonds.
but we need to categorize them into c-c, c=c, and c-h.
first, the molecule has two double bonds (c=c), so that's two c=c bonds.
each double bond counts as one c=c bond (but in terms of bond energy, a double bond has a certain value).
wait, no.
the bond energy given for c=c is 300 kj/mol (probably per mole of bonds).
each double bond in the molecule would correspond to one c=c bond.
so, each c=c bond is considered as one bond (even though chemically it consists of a sigma and pi bond).
so, in the molecule, there are two c=c bonds.
therefore, the number of c=c bonds is two.
then, the remaining bonds are c-c single bonds and c-h bonds.
total number of bonds: 24.
number of c=c bonds: 2.
so remaining bonds: 24 - 2 = 22.
these 22 bonds are either c-c single bonds or c-h bonds.
let's count the number of c-h bonds first.
the molecule has 22 h atoms, each involved in a c-h bond.
therefore, there are 22 c-h bonds.
therefore, the remaining bonds are c-c single bonds.
so total bonds: 24.
c=c bonds: 2.
c-h bonds: 22.
therefore, c-c single bonds: 24 - 2 - 22 = 0?
wait, that can't be.
wait, hold on.
this must be wrong.
wait, total bonds in the molecule:
each of the 12 carbons forms 4 bonds each.
total bonds: (12 * 4) / 2 = 24.
bonds in the molecule:
- two c=c double bonds (counted as two bonds)
- 22 c-h bonds (since there are 22 h atoms)
so total bonds: 2 + 22 = 24.
therefore, there are no c-c single bonds?
that doesn't seem right.
wait, that must be incorrect.
there must be some c-c single bonds.
let me re-examine the structure.
wait, in the molecule, each carbon is connected to other carbons either by single or double bonds.
let me consider the structure again.
the molecule has two double bonds (c1=c2 and c6=c7).
the remaining carbon atoms are connected by single bonds.
let's see:
carbon chain connections:
from left to right:
c1=c2-c3-c4-c5-c6=c7.
then, each of these carbons (c1, c2, ..., c7) has various substituents (methyl groups).
but the backbone is c1=c2-c3-c4-c5-c6=c7.
so, between c2 and c3: single bond.
between c3 and c4: single bond.
between c4 and c5: single bond.
between c5 and c6: single bond.
between c6 and c7: double bond.
therefore, in the backbone, there are four single bonds (c2-c3, c3-c4, c4-c5, c5-c6) and two double bonds (c1-c2 and c6-c7).
additionally, each of these carbons also has bonds to hydrogen or methyl groups.
so, the number of c-c single bonds in the molecule is 4 (backbone single bonds) plus any single bonds from branches.
however, the only branches are the methyl groups on c1, c4, c7.
let's check:
- c1 has two methyl groups (which are -ch3, so each ch3 is attached via a single bond to c1).
- c4 has one methyl group (-ch3), attached via a single bond to c4.
- c7 has two methyl groups, each attached via a single bond to c7.
therefore, the single bonds from branches are:
