Okay, let's see. The problem is about gamma-ray annihilation with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons producing electron-positron pairs. We need to find the energy threshold for gamma-rays where their lifetime in the universe is limited by this process. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 10^-3 eV. The answer choices are in GeV, which is 1e9 eV, so the numbers are really high energy. Hmm.

1: The Thomson scattering cross-section formula, σ = (8π/3)(e^2/(4πε0mec^2))^4, is considered for potential applicability. This formula, however, is specific to the Thomson scattering of a photon by an electron and is not directly relevant to the pair production process described in the problem.

2: The inverse Compton scattering cross-section formula, σ ≈ (8/3) * (σ_T) * (hν_γ / m_e c^2), might be considered for high-energy interactions. However, inverse Compton scattering involves a photon scattering off an electron, which is not the process described here.

3: The process involves gamma-ray photons from the CMB = (3σ_T/(8π)) * (Eγ/(10 GeV))^(-1) for energies above 10 GeV is considered for its applicability. This formula is a modified form of the Thomson cross-section for high-energy photon interactions. The specific threshold energy for pair production, where the photon energy is sufficient to create an electron-positron pair, is a critical factor in this context. The rest mass energy of an electron (or positron) is approximately 0.511 MeV. Pair production occurs when a photon interacts with another photon or a charged particle, and their combined energy is at least twice the rest mass energy of an electron (approximately 1.022 MeV).
The given process is γγ → e+e-.

1: Wait a second, maybe the problem is using a different approach. Let me recall the threshold condition for pair production. For two photons to produce an electron-positron pair, the total energy in the center-of-momentum frame must be at least 2m_e c^2. Also, one photon's energy has to be at least the rest mass energy of the electron (0.511 MeV) divided by the other photon's energy divided by the electron mass energy, or something like that? Wait, maybe I need to use the inverse Compton scattering threshold? No, it's pair production. Let me think again. The threshold for photon-photon pair production is when the product of the two photon energies (in appropriate units) exceeds a certain value. The formula I remember is that if you have two photons with energies E1 and E2, then the condition for pair production is E1 * E2 > (m_e c^2)^2 / (4 c^2) when expressed in terms of energy and the fine-structure constant or something? Wait, maybe I need to use c.g.s. units. Alternatively, the formula can be written as E1 * E2 > (m_e c^2)^2 / (4 h^2) times something? Hmm, this is a bit fuzzy. Wait, perhaps better to think in terms of the energy required. The minimum energy for each gamma-ray photon interacting with a CMB photon to produce a pair. Suppose the gamma-ray has energy E1 and the CMB photon has energy E2. Then, in the center-of-momentum frame, the total energy must be at least 2m_e c^2. But transformations between frames complicate things. Alternatively, there's a formula for the maximum energy of the produced electron. Wait, no. Maybe think of the threshold condition in the lab frame where the electron is initially at rest? Not quite. Wait, here's a better approach. For two photons to create a pair, their total energy in the center-of-mass frame must be at least 2m_e c^2, and they must be moving in opposite directions in that frame. The threshold occurs when the produced electron and positron would have zero kinetic energy in the center-of-mass frame, so all the energy goes into their rest mass.

1.1: The total energy in the lab frame is E1 + E2, and the total momentum is (E1 - E2)/c assuming the photons are moving in opposite directions. Wait, photons have momentum E/c. If the same direction, the relative signs matter. But actually, in the lab frame, the CMB photon is probably moving in some direction, and the gamma-ray is approaching it. But maybe we can consider the head-on collision for simplicity. Then, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame squared (s) is equal to (E1 - E2)^2 in natural units? Wait, energy and momentum need to be properly transformed. Alternatively, the invariant quantity is the square of the total four-momentum. For two photons colliding, the invariant s is s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 = 4 E1 E2. Wait, if the photons are moving in opposite directions, their three-momenta are opposite, so when you compute s = (P1 + P2)^2, where P1 and P2 are the four-vectors. Each four-vector is (E1, E1/c, 0, 0) and (E2, -E2/c, 0, 0) if moving opposite. Then, adding the four-vectors gives (E1 + E2, (E1 - E2)/c, 0, 0). The square of this is (E1 + E2)^2 - ((E1 - E2)/c)^2 c^2) = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 = 4 E1 E2. So the invariant s is 4 E1 E2. At threshold, this must equal the square of the total rest mass, which is (2 m_e c^2)^2 = 4 m_e^2 c^4. Therefore, 4 E1 E2 = 4 m_e^2 c^4, so E1 E2 = m_e^2 c^4. But if these are energies in SI units, then okay, but if in natural units where E is in eV, then we need to consider the c's and units. Wait, let me write it as E1 * E2 = (m_e c^2)^2. But since E1 and E2 are in eV, and m_e c^2 is approximately 0.511 MeV. Therefore, the formula would be E1 * E2 = (0.511 MeV)^2. But in this problem, the CMB photon energy is given as 1e-3 eV. So if E2 = 1e-3 eV, then E1 = (0.511 MeV)^2 / (1e-3 eV). Let me compute this. First, 0.511 MeV is 0.511 * 1e6 eV = 5.11e5 eV. Therefore, (5.11e5 eV)^2 = 26.1121e10 eV2. Then divide by 1e-3 eV: 26.1121e10 eV2 / 1e-3 eV = 26.1121e13 eV. So the result is 2.61121e14 eV. Wait, but converting that to GeV, since 1 GeV = 1e9 eV, so 2.61121e14 eV / 1e9 = 2.61121e5 GeV. So approximately 2.6e5 GeV. The answer choice A is 2.6*1e5 GeV. So this matches. Therefore, the answer should be A. But wait, let me check the reasoning again. The invariant s = 4 E1 E2 must equal (2 m_e c^2)^2. So solving for E1 * E2 = (m_e c^2)^2. Therefore, E1 = (m_e c^2)^2 / E2. If E2 is the CMB photon energy, then E1 = (0.511 MeV)^2 / E2. Plugging in the numbers: (0.511 MeV)^2 = (0.511 * 1e6 eV)^2 = (5.11e5 eV)^2 = 26.1121e10 eV2. E2 is 1e-3 eV. Therefore, E1 = 26.1121e10 eV2 / 1e-3 eV = 26.1121e13 eV. Convert eV to GeV: divide by 1e9. So 26.1121e13 / 1e9 = 26.1121e4 = 2.61121e5 GeV. So this is about 2.6e5 GeV, which is answer A. Therefore, the gamma-ray energy threshold is 2.6e5 GeV, so below this energy, they can interact with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs, thus their lifetime is limited by this process. Wait, but the question says "from what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process". So it's the energy above which their lifetime is limited by this process? Or below? Wait, hold on. If the gamma-ray energy is higher than the threshold, then they would be able to undergo this annihilation process, hence their lifetime is limited. If they are below the threshold, then this process is forbidden, so the lifetime isn't limited by this process. Therefore, the threshold energy is the minimum energy for the gamma-ray to annihilate with a CMB photon. Therefore, gamma-rays with energy above this threshold will have their lifetimes limited. So the answer is the threshold is 2.6e5 GeV, so gamma-rays above this energy. But the question says "from what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process". The phrase "from what energy" is a bit ambiguous. Does it mean "from (threshold energy) upwards", so above this energy? Then the answer would be A, as the threshold is 2.6e5 GeV. However, looking at the answer choices, they just list the energy. But how is the question phrased? "From what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process?" So it's asking for the energy scale where this annihilation starts to be effective. So the threshold energy is 2.6e5 GeV, so gamma-rays at or above this energy would interact. Thus, the answer is A. But why? Because if their energy is higher than the threshold, they can annihilate with CMB photons. If lower, they cannot, so their lifetime isn't limited by this process. Therefore, the lifetime is limited by this process for gamma-rays with energy starting from 2.6e5 GeV upwards. So the answer is A. But in the calculation, I got about 2.6e5 GeV, which is answer A. However, let's check if there's any factor missing. Wait, in the calculation above, when we derived the invariant s = 4 E1 E2, but then set that equal to (2 m_e c^2)^2. Thus, 4 E1 E2 = 4 m_e2 c^4 ⇒ E1 E2 = m_e2 c^4. Hence, E1 = m_e2 c^4 / E2. But in units where energies are in eV, E1 would be (m_e c^2)^2 / E2. Since m_e c^2 is 0.511 MeV, then (0.511 MeV)^2 / (1e-3 eV). That is, (0.511 * 1e6 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) = (0.511)^2 * 1e12 eV2 / 1e-3 eV = 0.261121 * 1e15 eV / 1 = 0.261121e15 eV. Then convert to GeV: divide by 1e9. 0.261121e15 eV / 1e9 eV/GeV = 0.261121e6 GeV = 2.61121e5 GeV. So same result. Thus, the calculation is solid. Therefore, answer A. But the answer choices had 2.6*1e5 GeV as A. Exactly. So I think that's correct. The key steps are: 1. The threshold condition for photon-photon pair production is E1 * E2 = (m_e c^2)^2. 2. Solving for E1: E1 = (m_e c^2)^2 / E2. 3. Plugging in m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV and E2 = 1e-3 eV. 4. Convert the result from eV to GeV. 5. Arrive at approximately 2.6e5 GeV. So the final answer is A. \boxed{A}

1.2: The square of the center-of-mass energy (s) is given by s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (|p1|c + |p2|c)^2. Assuming they are moving in opposite directions, the momentum terms subtract: s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (|p1|c - |p2|c)^2. For photons, E = pc, so p1c = E1 and p2c = E2. Therefore, s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 = [ (E1 + E2) + (E1 - E2) ] [ (E1 + E2) - (E1 - E2) ] = (2E1)(2E2) = 4 E1 E2.

2: The process γγ → e+e- must satisfy energy and momentum conservation. The threshold energy for pair production is derived from these conservation laws. The total energy of the two initial photons must be at least twice the rest mass energy of an electron (2m_e c^2).

The denominator is 4 * 1e-3 eV = 4e-3 eV.
The threshold energy Eγ is 2.61121e11 eV^2 / 4e-3 eV = 6.528025e13 eV.
This energy is approximately 6.5e13 eV, which is equivalent to 6.5e4 TeV or 6.5e7 GeV.
This calculated threshold energy is significantly higher than the provided answer options, suggesting a potential miscalculation or a different approach.

1: The process involves gamma-ray photons from the CMB interacting with other photons or charged particles to create electron-positron pairs. The minimum energy threshold for this pair production requires the sum of the photon energies) to be at least twice the electron rest mass energy (1.022 MeV). The minimum energy required for the incident gamma-ray photon when the CMB photon energies must be at least the electron rest mass energy an electron (approximately 1.02 MeV). The average photon energy of the CMB is 10^-3 eV.

This calculated threshold energy is significantly higher than the provided answer options, suggesting a potential error in calculation or a different approach.
The process might involve the product of the gamma-ray energy and the CMB photon energy exceeding a specific threshold.
The energies of the two photons must satisfy the condition E1 * E2 ≥ (m_e c^2)^2 / (4).
This formula is derived from the condition that the product of the photon energies must be greater than or equal to (m_e c^2)^2 / 4.

The average CMB photon energy E2 is 1e-3 eV.
The process involves two photons in the lab frame, one high-energy (E1) and one low-energy (E2, CMB).
The threshold condition signifies when pair production becomes possible.
The invariant quantity s for two photons moving in opposite directions is 4 E1 E2.
At threshold, this equals the square of the total rest mass (2 m_e c^2)^2 = 4 m_e^2 c^4.
This leads to 4 E1 E2 = 4 m_e^2 c^4, so E1 E2 = m_e^2 c^4.
For energies in eV, this is E1 * E2 = (m_e c^2)^2.
With m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV, E1 * E2 = (0.511 MeV)^2.
Given E2 = 1e-3 eV, E1 = (0.511 MeV)^2 / E2.
Converting 0.511 MeV to eV gives 5.11e5 eV.
(5.11e5 eV)^2 = 26.1121e10 eV2.
Dividing by 1e-3 eV gives 26.1121e13 eV.
Converting to GeV (1e9 eV/GeV) results in 26.1121e4 GeV = 2.61121e5 GeV.
This matches answer choice A.
The threshold energy is approximately 2.6e5 GeV.
Gamma-rays with energy above this threshold can annihilate with CMB photons.
Gamma-rays below this threshold cannot undergo this annihilation.

Answer: To determine the energy threshold for gamma-rays whose lifetimes in the universe are limited by annihilation with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons, we use the threshold condition for photon-photon pair production. The invariant quantity \( s \) for two photons moving in opposite directions is given by \( s = 4 E_1 E_2 \), which must equal the square of the total rest mass of the electron-positron pair, \( (2 m_e c^2)^2 \). This yields the equation:

\[
4 E_1 E_2 = 4 (m_e c^2)^2
\]

Simplifying, we find:

\[
E_1 E_2 = (m_e c^2)^2 \implies E_1 = \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_2}
\]

Given:
- The rest mass energy of an electron, \( m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \)
- The average CMB photon energy, \( E_2 = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV} \)

Converting \( m_e c^2 \) to eV:
\[
0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 5.11 \times 10^5 \, \text{eV}
\]

Calculating \( E_1 \):
\[
E_1 = \frac{(5.11 \times 10^5 \, \text{eV})^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}} = \frac{2.611 \times 10^{11} \, \text{eV}^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}} = 2.611 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}
\]

Converting eV to GeV:
\[
2.611 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV} = 2.611 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Thus, the threshold energy is approximately \( 2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV} \).

\[
\boxed{A}

1: wait a second, maybe the problem is using a different approach. let me recall the threshold condition for pair production. for two photons to produce an electron-positron pair, the total energy in the center-of-momentum frame must be at least 2m_e c^2. also, one photon's energy has to be at least the rest mass energy of the electron (0.511 mev) divided by the other photon's energy divided by the electron mass energy, or something like that? wait, maybe i need to use the inverse compton scattering threshold? no, it's pair production. let me think again. the threshold for photon-photon pair production is when the product of the two photon energies (in appropriate units) exceeds a certain value. the formula i remember is that if you have two photons with energies e1 and e2, then the condition for pair production is e1 * e2 > (m_e c^2)^2 / (4 c^2) when expressed in terms of energy and the fine-structure constant or something? wait, maybe i need to use c.g.s. units. alternatively, the formula can be written as e1 * e2 > (m_e c^2)^2 / (4 h^2) times something? hmm, this is a bit fuzzy. wait, perhaps better to think in terms of the energy required. the minimum energy for each gamma-ray photon interacting with a cmb photon to produce a pair. suppose the gamma-ray has energy e1 and the cmb photon has energy e2. then, in the center-of-momentum frame, the total energy must be at least 2m_e c^2. but transformations between frames complicate things. alternatively, there's a formula for the maximum energy of the produced electron. wait, no. maybe think of the threshold condition in the lab frame where the electron is initially at rest? not quite. wait, here's a better approach. for two photons to create a pair, their total energy in the center-of-mass frame must be at least 2m_e c^2, and they must be moving in opposite directions in that frame. the threshold occurs when the produced electron and positron would have zero kinetic energy in the center-of-mass frame, so all the energy goes into their rest mass.

1.1: the total energy in the lab frame is e1 + e2, and the total momentum is (e1 - e2)/c assuming the photons are moving in opposite directions. wait, photons have momentum e/c. if the same direction, the relative signs matter. but actually, in the lab frame, the cmb photon is probably moving in some direction, and the gamma-ray is approaching it. but maybe we can consider the head-on collision for simplicity. then, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame squared (s) is equal to (e1 - e2)^2 in natural units? wait, energy and momentum need to be properly transformed. alternatively, the invariant quantity is the square of the total four-momentum. for two photons colliding, the invariant s is s = (e1 + e2)^2 - (e1 - e2)^2 = 4 e1 e2. wait, if the photons are moving in opposite directions, their three-momenta are opposite, so when you compute s = (p1 + p2)^2, where p1 and p2 are the four-vectors. each four-vector is (e1, e1/c, 0, 0) and (e2, -e2/c, 0, 0) if moving opposite. then, adding the four-vectors gives (e1 + e2, (e1 - e2)/c, 0, 0). the square of this is (e1 + e2)^2 - ((e1 - e2)/c)^2 c^2) = (e1 + e2)^2 - (e1 - e2)^2 = 4 e1 e2. so the invariant s is 4 e1 e2. at threshold, this must equal the square of the total rest mass, which is (2 m_e c^2)^2 = 4 m_e^2 c^4. therefore, 4 e1 e2 = 4 m_e^2 c^4, so e1 e2 = m_e^2 c^4. but if these are energies in si units, then okay, but if in natural units where e is in ev, then we need to consider the c's and units. wait, let me write it as e1 * e2 = (m_e c^2)^2. but since e1 and e2 are in ev, and m_e c^2 is approximately 0.511 mev. therefore, the formula would be e1 * e2 = (0.511 mev)^2. but in this problem, the cmb photon energy is given as 1e-3 ev. so if e2 = 1e-3 ev, then e1 = (0.511 mev)^2 / (1e-3 ev). let me compute this. first, 0.511 mev is 0.511 * 1e6 ev = 5.11e5 ev. therefore, (5.11e5 ev)^2 = 26.1121e10 ev2. then divide by 1e-3 ev: 26.1121e10 ev2 / 1e-3 ev = 26.1121e13 ev. so the result is 2.61121e14 ev. wait, but converting that to gev, since 1 gev = 1e9 ev, so 2.61121e14 ev / 1e9 = 2.61121e5 gev. so approximately 2.6e5 gev. the answer choice a is 2.6*1e5 gev. so this matches. therefore, the answer should be a. but wait, let me check the reasoning again. the invariant s = 4 e1 e2 must equal (2 m_e c^2)^2. so solving for e1 * e2 = (m_e c^2)^2. therefore, e1 = (m_e c^2)^2 / e2. if e2 is the cmb photon energy, then e1 = (0.511 mev)^2 / e2. plugging in the numbers: (0.511 mev)^2 = (0.511 * 1e6 ev)^2 = (5.11e5 ev)^2 = 26.1121e10 ev2. e2 is 1e-3 ev. therefore, e1 = 26.1121e10 ev2 / 1e-3 ev = 26.1121e13 ev. convert ev to gev: divide by 1e9. so 26.1121e13 / 1e9 = 26.1121e4 = 2.61121e5 gev. so this is about 2.6e5 gev, which is answer a. therefore, the gamma-ray energy threshold is 2.6e5 gev, so below this energy, they can interact with cmb photons to produce electron-positron pairs, thus their lifetime is limited by this process. wait, but the question says "from what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process". so it's the energy above which their lifetime is limited by this process? or below? wait, hold on. if the gamma-ray energy is higher than the threshold, then they would be able to undergo this annihilation process, hence their lifetime is limited. if they are below the threshold, then this process is forbidden, so the lifetime isn't limited by this process. therefore, the threshold energy is the minimum energy for the gamma-ray to annihilate with a cmb photon. therefore, gamma-rays with energy above this threshold will have their lifetimes limited. so the answer is the threshold is 2.6e5 gev, so gamma-rays above this energy. but the question says "from what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process". the phrase "from what energy" is a bit ambiguous. does it mean "from (threshold energy) upwards", so above this energy? then the answer would be a, as the threshold is 2.6e5 gev. however, looking at the answer choices, they just list the energy. but how is the question phrased? "from what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process?" so it's asking for the energy scale where this annihilation starts to be effective. so the threshold energy is 2.6e5 gev, so gamma-rays at or above this energy would interact. thus, the answer is a. but why? because if their energy is higher than the threshold, they can annihilate with cmb photons. if lower, they cannot, so their lifetime isn't limited by this process. therefore, the lifetime is limited by this process for gamma-rays with energy starting from 2.6e5 gev upwards. so the answer is a. but in the calculation, i got about 2.6e5 gev, which is answer a. however, let's check if there's any factor missing. wait, in the calculation above, when we derived the invariant s = 4 e1 e2, but then set that equal to (2 m_e c^2)^2. thus, 4 e1 e2 = 4 m_e2 c^4 ⇒ e1 e2 = m_e2 c^4. hence, e1 = m_e2 c^4 / e2. but in units where energies are in ev, e1 would be (m_e c^2)^2 / e2. since m_e c^2 is 0.511 mev, then (0.511 mev)^2 / (1e-3 ev). that is, (0.511 * 1e6 ev)^2 / (1e-3 ev) = (0.511)^2 * 1e12 ev2 / 1e-3 ev = 0.261121 * 1e15 ev / 1 = 0.261121e15 ev. then convert to gev: divide by 1e9. 0.261121e15 ev / 1e9 ev/gev = 0.261121e6 gev = 2.61121e5 gev. so same result. thus, the calculation is solid. therefore, answer a. but the answer choices had 2.6*1e5 gev as a. exactly. so i think that's correct. the key steps are: 1. the threshold condition for photon-photon pair production is e1 * e2 = (m_e c^2)^2. 2. solving for e1: e1 = (m_e c^2)^2 / e2. 3. plugging in m_e c^2 = 0.511 mev and e2 = 1e-3 ev. 4. convert the result from ev to gev. 5. arrive at approximately 2.6e5 gev. so the final answer is a. \boxed{a}

1.2: the square of the center-of-mass energy (s) is given by s = (e1 + e2)^2 - (|p1|c + |p2|c)^2. assuming they are moving in opposite directions, the momentum terms subtract: s = (e1 + e2)^2 - (|p1|c - |p2|c)^2. for photons, e = pc, so p1c = e1 and p2c = e2. therefore, s = (e1 + e2)^2 - (e1 - e2)^2 = [ (e1 + e2) + (e1 - e2) ] [ (e1 + e2) - (e1 - e2) ] = (2e1)(2e2) = 4 e1 e2.

answer: to determine the energy threshold for gamma-rays whose lifetimes in the universe are limited by annihilation with cosmic microwave background (cmb) photons, we use the threshold condition for photon-photon pair production. the invariant quantity \( s \) for two photons moving in opposite directions is given by \( s = 4 e_1 e_2 \), which must equal the square of the total rest mass of the electron-positron pair, \( (2 m_e c^2)^2 \). this yields the equation:

\[
4 e_1 e_2 = 4 (m_e c^2)^2
\]

simplifying, we find:

\[
e_1 e_2 = (m_e c^2)^2 \implies e_1 = \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{e_2}
\]

given:
- the rest mass energy of an electron, \( m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{mev} \)
- the average cmb photon energy, \( e_2 = 10^{-3} \, \text{ev} \)

converting \( m_e c^2 \) to ev:
\[
0.511 \, \text{mev} = 5.11 \times 10^5 \, \text{ev}
\]

calculating \( e_1 \):
\[
e_1 = \frac{(5.11 \times 10^5 \, \text{ev})^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{ev}} = \frac{2.611 \times 10^{11} \, \text{ev}^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{ev}} = 2.611 \times 10^{14} \, \text{ev}
\]

converting ev to gev:
\[
2.611 \times 10^{14} \, \text{ev} = 2.611 \times 10^5 \, \text{gev}
\]

thus, the threshold energy is approximately \( 2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{gev} \).

</conclusion>

answer: to determine the energy threshold for gamma-rays whose lifetimes in the universe are limited by annihilation with cosmic microwave background (cmb) photons, we use the threshold condition for photon-photon pair production. the invariant quantity \( s \) for two photons moving in opposite directions is given by \( s = 4 e_1 e_2 \), which must equal the square of the total rest mass of the electron-positron pair, \( (2 m_e c^2)^2 \). this yields the equation:

\[
4 e_1 e_2 = 4 (m_e c^2)^2
\]

simplifying, we find:

\[
e_1 e_2 = (m_e c^2)^2 \implies e_1 = \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{e_2}
\]

given:
- the rest mass energy of an electron, \( m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{mev} \)
- the average cmb photon energy, \( e_2 = 10^{-3} \, \text{ev} \)

converting \( m_e c^2 \) to ev:
\[
0.511 \, \text{mev} = 5.11 \times 10^5 \, \text{ev}
\]

calculating \( e_1 \):
\[
e_1 = \frac{(5.11 \times 10^5 \, \text{ev})^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{ev}} = \frac{2.611 \times 10^{11} \, \text{ev}^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{ev}} = 2.611 \times 10^{14} \, \text{ev}
\]

converting ev to gev:
\[
2.611 \times 10^{14} \, \text{ev} = 2.611 \times 10^5 \, \text{gev}
\]

thus, the threshold energy is approximately \( 2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{gev} \).

\[
\boxed{a}
\]
