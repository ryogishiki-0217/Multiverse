Okay, let's see. So the problem is about an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. When heated, they produce gases. These gases then pass through three tubes: the first with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, which increased by 3.60 g; the second with Ca(OH)2 solution, which didn't change; and the third with red-hot copper, which increased by 0.80 g. Then there's 2.24 liters of gas C left at STP. We need to find the total number of atoms in salts A and B.
First, let's parse the problem step by step.
The initial mixture weighs 7.20 g and is equimolar, meaning equal moles of A and B. When heated, they decompose into gases. The gases then go through three tubes.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: Determine the function of the anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 in tube No.1 and the nature of the substance it absorbs.

<Outline>
2: Determine the function of the Ca(OH)2 solution in tube No.2 and the nature of the substance it absorbs.

3: Determine the function of the red-hot copper in tube No.3 and the nature of the substance it reacts with.

<Path>
1: The first tube, containing anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (tube No.1), is used for drying the gases or absorbing acidic gases like SO3 or HCl. Its weight increased by 3.60 grams, indicating it absorbed a substance, likely an acidic gas.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The second tube, containing a Ca(OH)2 solution, is likely intended to absorb acidic gases such as CO2, SO2, or HCl, as Ca(OH)2 is a base. The observation that its weight did not change suggests that no acidic gas was present in the gas mixture.
</Path>
<Path>
3: The third tube contains red-hot copper (Cu), and its weight increased by 0.80 grams, indicating a reaction has occurred. Copper in this state is likely acting as a reductant. The products of such a reaction are copper oxide (CuO) and another substance, possibly a gas.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
Tube No.1, containing Mg(ClO4)2, functions to absorb acidic gases like SO3 or HCl, with an observed 3.60g weight gain. Tube No.2, containing Ca(OH)2 solution, is intended to absorb acidic gases like CO2, SO2, or HCl; its constant weight implies no acidic gases passed through. Tube No.3, containing red-hot copper, is involved in a reaction, specifically the oxidation of a gas to form CuO and possibly another gas, resulting in an 0.80g weight gain.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Then, after passing through all these, 2.24 L of gas C remains at STP. Since 1 mole of gas at STP occupies 22.4 L, 2.24 L is 0.1 moles.

1: The volume of 2.24 liters at standard temperature and pressure (STP) corresponds to 0.1 moles of gas C, as 1 mole occupies 22.4 liters at STP.

2: The weight gain of 0.80 grams in tube No.3, containing red-hot copper, suggests the formation of copper oxide (CuO). This weight gain is due to the reaction of oxygen with copper, but the problem specifies that CuO forms, which could occur if an oxygen-containing gas reacts with the copper. This gas might be O2 or another gas that releases oxygen during the reaction. The presence of an anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 in tube No.1, which is a strong oxidizing agent, could imply that gases like HCl or SO3 are being oxidized. However, the lack of weight change in tube No.2 indicates no acidic gas was present. The gas that remained after passing through all tubes is gas C. The reaction in tube No.3, involving the formation of CuO, suggests that oxygen was involved. Copper in the red-hot state typically reduces gases, but in this scenario, the formation of CuO implies that copper was oxidized, meaning the gas that passed through must have been an oxidizing agent, such as O2. However, if the gas is O2, its weight gain would depend on the reaction stoichiometry.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The remaining gas C is determined to be 0.1 moles. The formation of CuO in tube No.3, resulting from a 0.80g weight gain, suggests that the gas passing through was an oxidizing agent, potentially oxygen (O2), which would react with the red-hot copper.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Wait, but the problem states that CuO is formed. So, the gas that passed through would have been something that oxidized the copper. If the original gases included something like O2, then the copper would oxidize to form CuO. But if the gas is O2, then where did the O2 come from? Wait, the salts A and B, when heated, produce gases. So maybe one of the gases is O2? Or perhaps H2O? Wait, but the first tube is Mg(ClO4)2, which might absorb something like HCl or SO3.

1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong oxidizing agent and is typically used for drying gases or absorbing acidic gases such as SO3 or HCl; it is not a drying agent for basic gases. The weight gain of 3.60 grams in tube No.1 indicates that the absorbed substance is likely an acidic gas. The mixture of salts A and B, when heated, produces gases. If the salts decompose to produce acidic gases like HCl or SO3, these would be absorbed by the Mg(ClO4)2. The weight gain of 3.60 grams represents the mass of the absorbed gas. The calculation of moles for the absorbed gas is relevant. The second tube, containing Ca(OH)2 solution, did not change in weight, implying that no acidic gas passed through it. This suggests that all acidic gases were absorbed by the first tube. The possibility of a gas other than an acidic one being absorbed by Mg(ClO4)2 is considered. Mg(ClO4)2 is a salt of a strong acid and is not generally a drying agent for gases like NH3. The specific function of Mg(ClO4)2 in this context requires clarification.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The weight gain of 0.80 grams in tube No.3, which contains red-hot copper, suggests that the gas passing through was oxygen (O2), as this would react with copper to form copper oxide (CuO). The reaction is Cu + O2 → CuO; however, the stoichiometry needs to be determined.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The gas absorbed by Mg(ClO4)2 in tube No.1 is likely an acidic gas such as HCl or SO3, given its properties and the lack of weight change in the subsequent Ca(OH)2 tube. The gas reacting with red-hot copper in tube No.3 is likely oxygen (O2), as this leads to the formation of CuO, though the exact stoichiometry needs to be established.

Wait, but if O2 is a gas produced, then passing through copper would form CuO. Let's see: 2 Cu + O2 → 2 CuO. For every 1 mole of O2, 2 moles of Cu are oxidized. The molar mass of Cu is 63.55 g/mol, so 2 moles of Cu would be 127.1 g. The molar mass of O2 is 32 g/mol. So, if 32 g of O2 produces 127.1 g of CuO (but actually, 2 moles of Cu combine with 1 mole of O2 to form 2 moles of CuO. The molar mass of CuO is 63.55 + 16 = 79.55 g/mol. So 2 moles of CuO would be 159.1 g. Therefore, the weight gain from Cu to CuO would be 159.1 g - 127.1 g = 32 g, which is exactly the mass of O2 added. Therefore, the weight gain in tube 3 is equal to the mass of O2 absorbed. Wait, in the problem, the weight of tube №3 increased by 0.80 g. So if the weight gain is equal to the mass of O2, then 0.80 g is the mass of O2 passed through.
Wait, but in the reaction, the mass gain in CuO is equal to the mass of oxygen, which is 0.80 g. So moles of O2 would be 0.80 g / 32 g/mol = 0.025 moles.
But wait, in the reaction 2 Cu + O2 → 2 CuO, 1 mole of O2 would add 32 g to the copper, so 0.80 g of O2 would correspond to 0.80 / 32 = 0.025 moles of O2. Therefore, 0.025 moles of O2 would have passed through tube 3. But then, where did the O2 come from? The decomposition of salts A and B.

1: The weight gain of 0.80 grams in tube No.3, containing red-hot copper, corresponds to the mass of oxygen that reacted to form copper oxide (CuO). Oxygen gas (O2) consists of molecules containing two oxygen atoms. The molar mass of O2 is 32 grams per mole. The number of moles of O2 is calculated by dividing its mass by its molar mass: 0.80 grams divided by 32 grams per mole, which equals 0.025 moles.

Wait, but the total moles of gases from the salts would be 0.025 (O2) + 0.1 (gas C) plus whatever was absorbed in tube 1. But the total initial moles of gases should equal the sum of these. But first, let's consider tube 1. The first tube with Mg(ClO4)2 increased by 3.60 g. What could that be? Mg(ClO4)2 is an anhydrous salt, so maybe it's absorbing water? Wait, but Mg(ClO4)2 is not a typical drying agent. Alternatively, maybe it's reacting with a gas? For example, if the gas is SO3, which reacts with Mg(ClO4)2 to form MgSO4 and 2 HClO4? Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, Mg(ClO4)2 can absorb acidic gases like HCl or SO3. For example, HCl would be absorbed by Mg(ClO4)2? Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the chemistry here. Alternatively, perhaps the weight gain in tube 1 is due to absorption of H2O. But Mg(ClO4)2 is anhydrous, so maybe it's acting as a desiccant. If the gases include water vapor, then the Mg(ClO4)2 would absorb it, increasing the weight. However, if the setup is without air and heated, maybe the salts release water? Wait, perhaps salts A and B are hydrates? But the problem states they are salts in an equimolar mixture weighing 7.20 g. When heated, they form gases. So maybe they are like nitrates or carbonates? For example, if they are nitrates decomposing to release NO2 and O2, or carbonates releasing CO2, but in this case, the gases have to interact with the tubes as described. Wait, tube 1 increases in weight, tube 2 doesn't, tube 3 increases. Let's think about the possible gases. The gases that came out when the salts were heated would have passed through tube 1 first. If tube 1 is Mg(ClO4)2, which is a strong oxidizer. Maybe the gas is something that reacts with it, like SO3 or HCl. For example, if the gas is HCl, then Mg(ClO4)2 could react with it: Mg(ClO4)2 + 16 HCl → MgCl2 + 2 ClO2 + 8 H2O + 5 Cl2. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the HCl is just being absorbed by the Mg(ClO4)2 as in a drying agent. Wait, but Mg(ClO4)2 is not typically a drying agent for HCl. Alternatively, if the gas is SO3, then Mg(ClO4)2 can react with it: Mg(ClO4)2 + SO3 → MgSO4 + 2 HClO4. But in that case, the weight gain would be due to the SO3 absorbed. The weight gain would be equal to the mass of SO3 absorbed. If the weight increased by 3.60 g, that would be the mass of SO3. The molar mass of SO3 is 80 g/mol. So 3.60 g / 80 g/mol = 0.045 mol of SO3. Alternatively, if the absorbed substance is HCl, then the weight gain would be the mass of HCl. HCl has a molar mass of 36.46 g/mol. 3.60 g / 36.46 g/mol ≈ 0.0987 mol. But I'm not sure which one it is. Alternatively, maybe the gas is H2O, but Mg(ClO4)2 is anhydrous and would absorb water? Wait, but how? Let's think: If the salts A and B, when heated, release water, then the Mg(ClO4)2 would absorb the water, but Mg(ClO4)2 is a perchlorate salt, which is hygroscopic but I don't know if it reacts with water. Alternatively, maybe the gas is SO3, which is acidic and would be absorbed by the Mg(ClO4)2. Let's proceed with that possibility. Suppose the gas absorbed by tube 1 is SO3. Then, moles of SO3 = 3.60 g / 80 g/mol = 0.045 mol. Then, tube 3 had a weight gain of 0.80 g due to O2. As calculated before, that's 0.025 mol O2. Then, the remaining gas is 0.1 mol. What is gas C? The possible gases from the decomposition of salts could be NO2, CO2, SO2, O2, H2O, NH3, etc. But after passing through the three tubes: tube 1 took SO3 (if present), tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution, which would absorb acidic gases. If tube 2 didn't gain weight, that means there was no acidic gas left after tube 1. So if tube 1 absorbed SO3, then that would leave O2 and perhaps another gas. Then tube 3, with red-hot copper, increased in weight due to forming CuO. So O2 would react with Cu to form CuO, thus removing O2. But in this case, O2 is the gas that's causing the weight gain in tube 3. Wait, but if O2 is removed by reacting with Cu to form CuO, then the gas that remains is whatever didn't react. If gas C is an inert gas, like perhaps N2 or Ar, but the problem states it's 2.24 L at STP, which is 0.1 mol. Alternatively, if the gas is NH3? But NH3 would likely react with Ca(OH)2. Wait, but tube 2 didn't change weight. If the gas is NH3, and tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution (which is limewater?), then NH3 would react with it: Ca(OH)2 + 2 NH3 → Ca(NH2)2 + 2 H2O. That would increase the weight of tube 2. But the problem states tube 2's weight didn't change. Therefore, the gas must not be basic or acidic. So perhaps the remaining gas is N2? But N2 is inert. Alternatively, maybe it's NO? Because NO would not react with Ca(OH)2, and would also not react with copper at that stage. But how would NO be produced? Maybe from nitrate decomposition. Wait, let's think about possible decomposition reactions that could produce SO3, O2, and NO. For example, if one of the salts is lead nitrate, Pb(NO3)2, which on heating decomposes into PbO, NO2, and O2: 2 Pb(NO3)2 → 2 PbO + 4 NO2 ↑ + O2 ↑. But then the gases would be NO2 and O2. However, NO2 is an acidic gas and would be absorbed by Ca(OH)2. But in our case, tube 2's weight didn't change, so if NO2 was present, it would have reacted with tube 2. Therefore, the gases can't include NO2. Alternatively, maybe the salts are sulfates? For example, on heating, they might release SO3 and O2. For example, CuSO4·5H2O when heated releases SO3 and H2O, but if it's anhydrous, further heating might release SO3. Wait, for example: 2 CuSO4 → 2 CuO + 2 SO2 + O2. But SO2 is an acidic gas and would be absorbed by tube 2. But the problem says tube 2's weight didn't change. Therefore, this can't be the case. Alternatively, maybe the salts are nitrates that decompose to form N2O or something else. For example: 2 NH4NO3 → 2 N2O ↑ + 4 H2O ↑ + O2 ↑. Then the gases would be N2O, H2O, and O2. H2O would be absorbed by tube 1 (if it's a drying agent). N2O is not acidic, so wouldn't be absorbed by tube 2. Then O2 would react with Cu in tube 3 to form CuO, and N2O would remain as gas C. However, N2O is a gas that might not be reactive with Ca(OH)2. But if tube 1 is Mg(ClO4)2, which is a drying agent, maybe it's absorbing H2O. So if H2O is present, then tube 1 would gain weight (3.60 g). Then the remaining gases would be N2O and O2. O2 would react with Cu in tube 3, forming CuO (0.80 g gain). Then N2O would pass through, but N2O is not an acidic gas, so tube 2 wouldn't react. Then the remaining gas would be N2O (0.1 moles). However, is N2O a possible product? Alternatively, maybe the salts are azo compounds, but that might be a stretch. Alternatively, maybe the gas is NH3. If NH3 is present, it would react with Ca(OH)2 in tube 2: 2 NH3 + Ca(OH)2 → Ca(NH2)2 + 2 H2O, causing an increase in weight. Since tube 2's weight didn't change, NH3 can't be present. Alternatively, maybe the gas is CO. CO is not reactive with Ca(OH)2, but would it react with Cu? If the Cu is red-hot, maybe CO would react: CuO + CO → Cu + CO2. Wait, but in that case, tube 3 would lose weight if CO were passing through and reducing CuO. But in the problem, tube 3's weight increased by 0.80 g, which suggests oxidation (forming CuO). So Cu in tube 3 was oxidized by O2 to form CuO, hence the weight gain. Therefore, the gas passing through tube 3 must be O2, which reacted with Cu to form CuO. Then, the remaining gas C would be a gas that isn't absorbed or reacted along the way. If the original gases were SO3, O2, and maybe another gas like N2, then: - SO3 is absorbed by tube 1 (3.60 g) - O2 goes to tube 3 and is absorbed, forming CuO (0.80 g) - N2 (or another inert gas) would remain, with a volume of 2.24 L (0.1 mol). But N2 isn't typically produced from salt decomposition. Alternatively, maybe the gas is NO. NO is not reactive with Ca(OH)2 (doesn't typically react with bases like NaOH or Ca(OH)2). Then, NO would pass through and could be the remaining gas. However, would NO react with Cu? At high temperatures, maybe, but if the Cu is already red-hot, perhaps the NO would just pass through. So maybe the remaining gas is NO, meaning 0.1 moles of NO remain. But how does NO fit into the overall decomposition? Let's think about possible salts that would decompose to give SO3, O2, and NO. Alternatively, perhaps the salts are a nitrate and a sulfate. For example, if salt A is Pb(NO3)2 and salt B is Na2SO4. Wait, but let's check the equimolar mixture. If they are in an equimolar mix, 7.20 g total. Let's assume each is 3.60 g. Let's check molar masses. Pb(NO3)2: 207.2 + 2*(14 + 48) = 207.2 + 2*62 = 207.2 + 124 = 331.2 g/mol. Na2SO4: 2*23 + 32 + 4*16 = 46 + 32 + 64 = 142 g/mol. If each is 3.60 g, moles would be: Pb(NO3)2: 3.60 / 331.2 ≈ 0.0109 mol. Na2SO4: 3.60 / 142 ≈ 0.0253 mol. But they need to be equimolar. Therefore, this assumption is wrong. Alternatively, maybe the salts are something else. Alternatively, maybe the salts are ammonium nitrate and something else. Wait, NH4NO3: 80.04 g/mol. So 3.60 g would be 0.0449 mol. Another salt, for example, MgSO4·7H2O (246.5 g/mol). 3.60 g is 0.0146 mol. Not equimolar. Maybe another pair. Wait, maybe the salts are KClO4 and something else. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the salts are KNO3 and (NH4)2SO4. Let's think: KNO3 decomposes to KNO2 + 1⁄2 O2↑. (NH4)2SO4 decomposes to H2SO4 + 2 NH3↑. However, the products might not align with the observed gases. Alternatively, maybe the salts are NaNO3 and CuSO4·5H2O. Wait, let's consider NaNO3: 2 NaNO3 → 2 NaNO2 + O2. That would produce O2. CuSO4·5H2O loses water on heating, then maybe decomposes to CuO + SO3. If so, then heating would produce H2O and SO3. So if we have an equimolar mixture of NaNO3 and CuSO4·5H2O: Each salt would be 3.60 g. Let's check molar masses: NaNO3: 23 + 14 + 48 = 85 g/mol. CuSO4·5H2O: 159.6 + 90 = 249.6 g/mol. Moles: NaNO3: 3.60 / 85 ≈ 0.0423 mol. CuSO4·5H2O: 3.60 / 249.6 ≈ 0.0144 mol. Not equimolar. So this can't be. Alternatively, maybe the salts are KCl and KClO3. When heated, KClO3 decomposes to KCl + O2. But KCl doesn't decompose. However, if they are in an equimolar mixture, but that might not produce the right gases. Alternatively, maybe one of the salts is (NH4)2Cr2O7, which on heating decomposes to Cr2O3 + 4 H2O + N2. The gases would be H2O and N2. H2O would be absorbed by tube 1, N2 would pass through and be the remaining gas. But where does O2 come from? Alternatively, perhaps the salts are AgNO3 and KCl. But these are just salts. When heated, AgNO3 decomposes: 2 AgNO3 → 2 Ag + 2 NO2↑ + O2↑. KCl doesn't decompose. So the gases would be NO2 and O2. NO2 is an acidic gas and would be absorbed by tube 2 (Ca(OH)2), causing an increase in weight. But in the problem, tube 2's weight doesn't change. Therefore, this can't be. Wait, perhaps the salts are Na2SO3 and NaNO3. Heating Na2SO3 produces SO2 and Na2SO4. NaNO3 decomposes to NaNO2 and O2. So the gases would be SO2 and O2. But SO2 is acidic and would be absorbed by tube 2, leading to weight gain. Since tube 2's weight didn't change, this is not possible. Alternatively, maybe the salts are NaHCO3 and NH4HCO3. When heated, they decompose into CO2, H2O, NH3. All these gases are acidic or basic and would be absorbed by tube 2. Since tube 2's weight didn't change, this isn't possible. Alternatively, maybe the salts are KClO3 and KI. However, when heated, KClO3 decomposes to KCl and O2. KI might not decompose. So only O2 would be produced, but then where does SO3 come from? This seems incomplete. Wait, going back. Let's suppose that the total moles of gas produced are the sum of the gas absorbed in tube 1, the gas reacted in tube 3, and the gas remaining. That would be 0.045 mol (SO3) + 0.025 mol (O2) + 0.1 mol (C) = 0.17 mol total gas. Alternatively, maybe. But how does this relate to the moles of the salts? The problem states it's an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. Let's assume each salt produces a certain gas upon heating. Let’s denote: Salt A → gas X Salt B → gas Y The mixture produces X and Y in equimolar amounts. However, maybe X decomposes further? Not sure. Alternatively, the total moles of gas would be the sum of the moles of each gas. If the salts are equimolar, then moles of X and Y should be equal. Suppose each salt, when heated, produces n moles of gas. Therefore, total moles of gas would be 2n. But the total moles we have from the problem is 0.045 + 0.025 + 0.1 = 0.17 moles. But 2n = 0.17? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps each salt when heated produces multiple gases. For instance, Salt A produces SO3 and O2, and Salt B produces O2 and another inert gas. But let's think with actual compounds. Suppose Salt A is (NH4)2SO4 and Salt B is KNO3. When heated: (NH4)2SO4 → H2SO4 + 2 NH3↑ (but at higher temperatures, it might break down further). KNO3 → KNO2 + 1⁄2 O2↑. If we have an equimolar mixture, then moles of (NH4)2SO4 = moles of KNO3 = n. Total gas produced: From (NH4)2SO4: 2n NH3 (if complete decomposition) From KNO3: n O2. But NH3 would be absorbed by tube 2 (Ca(OH)2)), causing weight gain. But since tube 2's weight doesn't change, NH3 can't be present. So this can't be. Alternatively, maybe the salts are MgSO4·7H2O and Pb(NO3)2. When heated, MgSO4·7H2O loses water: MgSO4·7H2O → MgSO4 + 7 H2O↑. Pb(NO3)2 decomposes: 2 Pb(NO3)2 → 2 PbO + 4 NO2↑ + O2↑. So total gases would be H2O, NO2, and O2. H2O is acidic? No, it's a neutral gas. But wait, H2O would be absorbed by Mg(ClO4)2 in tube 1? If tube 1 is a drying agent, then H2O would be absorbed. NO2 is acidic and would be absorbed by tube 2 (Ca(OH)2), leading to weight gain. But tube 2's weight doesn't change, so NO2 can't be present. Therefore, this can't be. Alternatively, maybe the salts are KClO3 and (NH4)2SO3. KClO3 → KCl + O2. (NH4)2SO3 → (NH4)2SO4 (under certain conditions) – not sure. Maybe producing gases like SO2? If so, SO2 is acidic and would be absorbed by tube 2. Not suitable. Alternatively, maybe the salts are Na2CO3 and (NH4)2S. When heated: Na2CO3 → Na2O + CO2↑. (NH4)2S → 2 NH3↑ + H2S↑. CO2 and H2S are acidic and would be absorbed by tube 2, leading to weight gain. Since tube 2's weight didn't change, this can't be. Wait, perhaps the salts are Ag2SO4 and KClO3. Ag2SO4 on heating might decompose into Ag2O and SO3. KClO3 decomposes to KCl and O2. Thus: Ag2SO4 → Ag2O + SO3↑. KClO3 → KCl + O2↑. Therefore, gases are SO3 and O2. SO3 is absorbed by tube 1 (Mg(ClO4)2), weight gain 3.60 g. O2 goes to tube 3, forming CuO and increasing weight by 0.80 g. Then, what's the remaining gas? If Ag2SO4 and KClO3 are in equimolar ratio, and each produces 1 mole of gas per mole of salt, then the total gas moles would be sum of SO3 and O2. Wait, but if they are in equimolar amounts, and each mole produces 1 mole of gas, then total moles of gas would be 2n. But n is the moles of each salt. But how much is n? The total weight of salts is 7.20 g. Molar masses: Ag2SO4: 2*107.87 + 32.07 + 4*16 = 215.74 + 32.07 + 64 = 311.81 g/mol. KClO3: 39.1 + 35.45 + 3*16 = 39.1 + 35.45 + 48 = 122.55 g/mol. If each is n moles, then: n*(311.81) + n*(122.55) = 7.20. n*(311.81 + 122.55) = 7.20. n = 7.20 / 434.36 ≈ 0.0166 mol. Thus, total moles of gases would be 0.0166 moles of SO3 + 0.0166 moles of O2 ≈ 0.0332 moles. But according to the problem, the total moles of gas should be 0.045 (SO3) + 0.025 (O2) + 0.1 (remaining gas) = 0.17 moles. This is a discrepancy. Therefore, this can't be. Alternatively, maybe the salts are Na2S2O3·5H2O and KBrO3. When heated, Na2S2O3·5H2O → Na2S2O3 + 5 H2O. Then Na2S2O3 might decompose further. KBrO3 might decompose to KBr + O2. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the salts are H2SO4 (concentrated) and KClO3. But these are not salts per se. Alternatively, maybe the salts are Na2O2 and MgSO4. Na2O2 reacts with water to produce O2, but when heated with MgSO4... Not sure. Alternatively, think about the total moles of gases. Total moles: 0.045 (from tube 1) + 0.025 (from tube 3) + 0.1 (remaining) = 0.17 moles. If the salts are in equimolar amounts, suppose each is 'n' moles. Depending on the reaction stoichiometry, the total moles of gas could vary. If each salt produces a certain number of moles of gas. For instance, if Salt A produces 3 moles of gas per mole, and Salt B produces 1 mole per mole, then total gas moles would be 3n + 1n = 4n = 0.17 moles. But this is getting too convoluted. Let's switch to considering the possible remaining gas C. Since the remaining gas is 0.1 moles (0.1 mol) and tube 3 had a 0.80 g weight gain (which we associated with 0.025 moles of O2), and tube 1 had a 3.60 g gain (maybe SO3, 0.045 moles), then total moles would be 0.045 + 0.025 + 0.1 = 0.17 moles.

an equimolar mixture of salts a and b weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°c without air. in this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous mg(clo4)2 (№1), ca(oh)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (cuo formed in tube №3). the weight of the second tube has not changed. as a result, only 2.24 liters of gas c (standard temperature and pressure) remained.

okay, let's see. so the problem is about an equimolar mixture of salts a and b. when heated, they produce gases. these gases then pass through three tubes: the first with anhydrous mg(clo4)2, which increased by 3.60 g; the second with ca(oh)2 solution, which didn't change; and the third with red-hot copper, which increased by 0.80 g. then there's 2.24 liters of gas c left at stp. we need to find the total number of atoms in salts a and b.
first, let's parse the problem step by step.
the initial mixture weighs 7.20 g and is equimolar, meaning equal moles of a and b. when heated, they decompose into gases. the gases then go through three tubes.
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>
<goal>
<outline>
1: determine the function of the anhydrous mg(clo4)2 in tube no.1 and the nature of the substance it absorbs.
</outline>
<outline>
2: determine the function of the ca(oh)2 solution in tube no.2 and the nature of the substance it absorbs.
</outline>
<outline>
3: determine the function of the red-hot copper in tube no.3 and the nature of the substance it reacts with.
</outline>
</goal>
<path>
1: the first tube, containing anhydrous mg(clo4)2 (tube no.1), is used for drying the gases or absorbing acidic gases like so3 or hcl. its weight increased by 3.60 grams, indicating it absorbed a substance, likely an acidic gas.
</path>
<path>
2: the second tube, containing a ca(oh)2 solution, is likely intended to absorb acidic gases such as co2, so2, or hcl, as ca(oh)2 is a base. the observation that its weight did not change suggests that no acidic gas was present in the gas mixture.
</path>
<path>
3: the third tube contains red-hot copper (cu), and its weight increased by 0.80 grams, indicating a reaction has occurred. copper in this state is likely acting as a reductant. the products of such a reaction are copper oxide (cuo) and another substance, possibly a gas.
</path>
<conclusion>
tube no.1, containing mg(clo4)2, functions to absorb acidic gases like so3 or hcl, with an observed 3.60g weight gain. tube no.2, containing ca(oh)2 solution, is intended to absorb acidic gases like co2, so2, or hcl; its constant weight implies no acidic gases passed through. tube no.3, containing red-hot copper, is involved in a reaction, specifically the oxidation of a gas to form cuo and possibly another gas, resulting in an 0.80g weight gain.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
then, after passing through all these, 2.24 l of gas c remains at stp. since 1 mole of gas at stp occupies 22.4 l, 2.24 l is 0.1 moles.
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>
<goal>
<outline>
1: determine the number of moles of gas c remaining after the reaction.
</outline>
<outline>
2: identify the type of gas that could produce a 0.80g weight gain in tube no.3 containing red-hot copper, resulting in the formation of cuo.
</outline>
</goal>
<path>
1: the volume of 2.24 liters at standard temperature and pressure (stp) corresponds to 0.1 moles of gas c, as 1 mole occupies 22.4 liters at stp.
</path>
<path>
2: the weight gain of 0.80 grams in tube no.3, containing red-hot copper, suggests the formation of copper oxide (cuo). this weight gain is due to the reaction of oxygen with copper, but the problem specifies that cuo forms, which could occur if an oxygen-containing gas reacts with the copper. this gas might be o2 or another gas that releases oxygen during the reaction. the presence of an anhydrous mg(clo4)2 in tube no.1, which is a strong oxidizing agent, could imply that gases like hcl or so3 are being oxidized. however, the lack of weight change in tube no.2 indicates no acidic gas was present. the gas that remained after passing through all tubes is gas c. the reaction in tube no.3, involving the formation of cuo, suggests that oxygen was involved. copper in the red-hot state typically reduces gases, but in this scenario, the formation of cuo implies that copper was oxidized, meaning the gas that passed through must have been an oxidizing agent, such as o2. however, if the gas is o2, its weight gain would depend on the reaction stoichiometry.
</path>
<conclusion>
the remaining gas c is determined to be 0.1 moles. the formation of cuo in tube no.3, resulting from a 0.80g weight gain, suggests that the gas passing through was an oxidizing agent, potentially oxygen (o2), which would react with the red-hot copper.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
wait, but the problem states that cuo is formed. so, the gas that passed through would have been something that oxidized the copper. if the original gases included something like o2, then the copper would oxidize to form cuo. but if the gas is o2, then where did the o2 come from? wait, the salts a and b, when heated, produce gases. so maybe one of the gases is o2? or perhaps h2o? wait, but the first tube is mg(clo4)2, which might absorb something like hcl or so3.
let's think in parallel.

1: anhydrous mg(clo4)2 is a strong oxidizing agent and is typically used for drying gases or absorbing acidic gases such as so3 or hcl; it is not a drying agent for basic gases. the weight gain of 3.60 grams in tube no.1 indicates that the absorbed substance is likely an acidic gas. the mixture of salts a and b, when heated, produces gases. if the salts decompose to produce acidic gases like hcl or so3, these would be absorbed by the mg(clo4)2. the weight gain of 3.60 grams represents the mass of the absorbed gas. the calculation of moles for the absorbed gas is relevant. the second tube, containing ca(oh)2 solution, did not change in weight, implying that no acidic gas passed through it. this suggests that all acidic gases were absorbed by the first tube. the possibility of a gas other than an acidic one being absorbed by mg(clo4)2 is considered. mg(clo4)2 is a salt of a strong acid and is not generally a drying agent for gases like nh3. the specific function of mg(clo4)2 in this context requires clarification.
</path>
<path>
2: the weight gain of 0.80 grams in tube no.3, which contains red-hot copper, suggests that the gas passing through was oxygen (o2), as this would react with copper to form copper oxide (cuo). the reaction is cu + o2 → cuo; however, the stoichiometry needs to be determined.
</path>
<conclusion>
the gas absorbed by mg(clo4)2 in tube no.1 is likely an acidic gas such as hcl or so3, given its properties and the lack of weight change in the subsequent ca(oh)2 tube. the gas reacting with red-hot copper in tube no.3 is likely oxygen (o2), as this leads to the formation of cuo, though the exact stoichiometry needs to be established.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
wait, but if o2 is a gas produced, then passing through copper would form cuo. let's see: 2 cu + o2 → 2 cuo. for every 1 mole of o2, 2 moles of cu are oxidized. the molar mass of cu is 63.55 g/mol, so 2 moles of cu would be 127.1 g. the molar mass of o2 is 32 g/mol. so, if 32 g of o2 produces 127.1 g of cuo (but actually, 2 moles of cu combine with 1 mole of o2 to form 2 moles of cuo. the molar mass of cuo is 63.55 + 16 = 79.55 g/mol. so 2 moles of cuo would be 159.1 g. therefore, the weight gain from cu to cuo would be 159.1 g - 127.1 g = 32 g, which is exactly the mass of o2 added. therefore, the weight gain in tube 3 is equal to the mass of o2 absorbed. wait, in the problem, the weight of tube №3 increased by 0.80 g. so if the weight gain is equal to the mass of o2, then 0.80 g is the mass of o2 passed through.
wait, but in the reaction, the mass gain in cuo is equal to the mass of oxygen, which is 0.80 g. so moles of o2 would be 0.80 g / 32 g/mol = 0.025 moles.
but wait, in the reaction 2 cu + o2 → 2 cuo, 1 mole of o2 would add 32 g to the copper, so 0.80 g of o2 would correspond to 0.80 / 32 = 0.025 moles of o2. therefore, 0.025 moles of o2 would have passed through tube 3. but then, where did the o2 come from? the decomposition of salts a and b.

1: the weight gain of 0.80 grams in tube no.3, containing red-hot copper, corresponds to the mass of oxygen that reacted to form copper oxide (cuo). oxygen gas (o2) consists of molecules containing two oxygen atoms. the molar mass of o2 is 32 grams per mole. the number of moles of o2 is calculated by dividing its mass by its molar mass: 0.80 grams divided by 32 grams per mole, which equals 0.025 moles. therefore, 0.025 moles of oxygen gas (o2) were consumed in the reaction with copper.

wait, but the total moles of gases from the salts would be 0.025 (o2) + 0.1 (gas c) plus whatever was absorbed in tube 1. but the total initial moles of gases should equal the sum of these. but first, let's consider tube 1. the first tube with mg(clo4)2 increased by 3.60 g. what could that be? mg(clo4)2 is an anhydrous salt, so maybe it's absorbing water? wait, but mg(clo4)2 is not a typical drying agent. alternatively, maybe it's reacting with a gas? for example, if the gas is so3, which reacts with mg(clo4)2 to form mgso4 and 2 hclo4? wait, but i'm not sure. alternatively, mg(clo4)2 can absorb acidic gases like hcl or so3. for example, hcl would be absorbed by mg(clo4)2? wait, but i'm not entirely sure about the chemistry here. alternatively, perhaps the weight gain in tube 1 is due to absorption of h2o. but mg(clo4)2 is anhydrous, so maybe it's acting as a desiccant. if the gases include water vapor, then the mg(clo4)2 would absorb it, increasing the weight. however, if the setup is without air and heated, maybe the salts release water? wait, perhaps salts a and b are hydrates? but the problem states they are salts in an equimolar mixture weighing 7.20 g. when heated, they form gases. so maybe they are like nitrates or carbonates? for example, if they are nitrates decomposing to release no2 and o2, or carbonates releasing co2, but in this case, the gases have to interact with the tubes as described. wait, tube 1 increases in weight, tube 2 doesn't, tube 3 increases. let's think about the possible gases. the gases that came out when the salts were heated would have passed through tube 1 first. if tube 1 is mg(clo4)2, which is a strong oxidizer. maybe the gas is something that reacts with it, like so3 or hcl. for example, if the gas is hcl, then mg(clo4)2 could react with it: mg(clo4)2 + 16 hcl → mgcl2 + 2 clo2 + 8 h2o + 5 cl2. but i'm not sure. alternatively, maybe the hcl is just being absorbed by the mg(clo4)2 as in a drying agent. wait, but mg(clo4)2 is not typically a drying agent for hcl. alternatively, if the gas is so3, then mg(clo4)2 can react with it: mg(clo4)2 + so3 → mgso4 + 2 hclo4. but in that case, the weight gain would be due to the so3 absorbed. the weight gain would be equal to the mass of so3 absorbed. if the weight increased by 3.60 g, that would be the mass of so3. the molar mass of so3 is 80 g/mol. so 3.60 g / 80 g/mol = 0.045 mol of so3. alternatively, if the absorbed substance is hcl, then the weight gain would be the mass of hcl. hcl has a molar mass of 36.46 g/mol. 3.60 g / 36.46 g/mol ≈ 0.0987 mol. but i'm not sure which one it is. alternatively, maybe the gas is h2o, but mg(clo4)2 is anhydrous and would absorb water? wait, but how? let's think: if the salts a and b, when heated, release water, then the mg(clo4)2 would absorb the water, but mg(clo4)2 is a perchlorate salt, which is hygroscopic but i don't know if it reacts with water. alternatively, maybe the gas is so3, which is acidic and would be absorbed by the mg(clo4)2. let's proceed with that possibility. suppose the gas absorbed by tube 1 is so3. then, moles of so3 = 3.60 g / 80 g/mol = 0.045 mol. then, tube 3 had a weight gain of 0.80 g due to o2. as calculated before, that's 0.025 mol o2. then, the remaining gas is 0.1 mol. what is gas c? the possible gases from the decomposition of salts could be no2, co2, so2, o2, h2o, nh3, etc. but after passing through the three tubes: tube 1 took so3 (if present), tube 2 is ca(oh)2 solution, which would absorb acidic gases. if tube 2 didn't gain weight, that means there was no acidic gas left after tube 1. so if tube 1 absorbed so3, then that would leave o2 and perhaps another gas. then tube 3, with red-hot copper, increased in weight due to forming cuo. so o2 would react with cu to form cuo, thus removing o2. but in this case, o2 is the gas that's causing the weight gain in tube 3. wait, but if o2 is removed by reacting with cu to form cuo, then the gas that remains is whatever didn't react. if gas c is an inert gas, like perhaps n2 or ar, but the problem states it's 2.24 l at stp, which is 0.1 mol. alternatively, if the gas is nh3? but nh3 would likely react with ca(oh)2. wait, but tube 2 didn't change weight. if the gas is nh3, and tube 2 is ca(oh)2 solution (which is limewater?), then nh3 would react with it: ca(oh)2 + 2 nh3 → ca(nh2)2 + 2 h2o. that would increase the weight of tube 2. but the problem states tube 2's weight didn't change. therefore, the gas must not be basic or acidic. so perhaps the remaining gas is n2? but n2 is inert. alternatively, maybe it's no? because no would not react with ca(oh)2, and would also not react with copper at that stage. but how would no be produced? maybe from nitrate decomposition. wait, let's think about possible decomposition reactions that could produce so3, o2, and no. for example, if one of the salts is lead nitrate, pb(no3)2, which on heating decomposes into pbo, no2, and o2: 2 pb(no3)2 → 2 pbo + 4 no2 ↑ + o2 ↑. but then the gases would be no2 and o2. however, no2 is an acidic gas and would be absorbed by ca(oh)2. but in our case, tube 2's weight didn't change, so if no2 was present, it would have reacted with tube 2. therefore, the gases can't include no2. alternatively, maybe the salts are sulfates? for example, on heating, they might release so3 and o2. for example, cuso4·5h2o when heated releases so3 and h2o, but if it's anhydrous, further heating might release so3. wait, for example: 2 cuso4 → 2 cuo + 2 so2 + o2. but so2 is an acidic gas and would be absorbed by tube 2. but the problem says tube 2's weight didn't change. therefore, this can't be the case. alternatively, maybe the salts are nitrates that decompose to form n2o or something else. for example: 2 nh4no3 → 2 n2o ↑ + 4 h2o ↑ + o2 ↑. then the gases would be n2o, h2o, and o2. h2o would be absorbed by tube 1 (if it's a drying agent). n2o is not acidic, so wouldn't be absorbed by tube 2. then o2 would react with cu in tube 3 to form cuo, and n2o would remain as gas c. however, n2o is a gas that might not be reactive with ca(oh)2. but if tube 1 is mg(clo4)2, which is a drying agent, maybe it's absorbing h2o. so if h2o is present, then tube 1 would gain weight (3.60 g). then the remaining gases would be n2o and o2. o2 would react with cu in tube 3, forming cuo (0.80 g gain). then n2o would pass through, but n2o is not an acidic gas, so tube 2 wouldn't react. then the remaining gas would be n2o (0.1 moles). however, is n2o a possible product? alternatively, maybe the salts are azo compounds, but that might be a stretch. alternatively, maybe the gas is nh3. if nh3 is present, it would react with ca(oh)2 in tube 2: 2 nh3 + ca(oh)2 → ca(nh2)2 + 2 h2o, causing an increase in weight. since tube 2's weight didn't change, nh3 can't be present. alternatively, maybe the gas is co. co is not reactive with ca(oh)2, but would it react with cu? if the cu is red-hot, maybe co would react: cuo + co → cu + co2. wait, but in that case, tube 3 would lose weight if co were passing through and reducing cuo. but in the problem, tube 3's weight increased by 0.80 g, which suggests oxidation (forming cuo). so cu in tube 3 was oxidized by o2 to form cuo, hence the weight gain. therefore, the gas passing through tube 3 must be o2, which reacted with cu to form cuo. then, the remaining gas c would be a gas that isn't absorbed or reacted along the way. if the original gases were so3, o2, and maybe another gas like n2, then: - so3 is absorbed by tube 1 (3.60 g) - o2 goes to tube 3 and is absorbed, forming cuo (0.80 g) - n2 (or another inert gas) would remain, with a volume of 2.24 l (0.1 mol). but n2 isn't typically produced from salt decomposition. alternatively, maybe the gas is no. no is not reactive with ca(oh)2 (doesn't typically react with bases like naoh or ca(oh)2). then, no would pass through and could be the remaining gas. however, would no react with cu? at high temperatures, maybe, but if the cu is already red-hot, perhaps the no would just pass through. so maybe the remaining gas is no, meaning 0.1 moles of no remain. but how does no fit into the overall decomposition? let's think about possible salts that would decompose to give so3, o2, and no. alternatively, perhaps the salts are a nitrate and a sulfate. for example, if salt a is pb(no3)2 and salt b is na2so4. wait, but let's check the equimolar mixture. if they are in an equimolar mix, 7.20 g total. let's assume each is 3.60 g. let's check molar masses. pb(no3)2: 207.2 + 2*(14 + 48) = 207.2 + 2*62 = 207.2 + 124 = 331.2 g/mol. na2so4: 2*23 + 32 + 4*16 = 46 + 32 + 64 = 142 g/mol. if each is 3.60 g, moles would be: pb(no3)2: 3.60 / 331.2 ≈ 0.0109 mol. na2so4: 3.60 / 142 ≈ 0.0253 mol. but they need to be equimolar. therefore, this assumption is wrong. alternatively, maybe the salts are something else. alternatively, maybe the salts are ammonium nitrate and something else. wait, nh4no3: 80.04 g/mol. so 3.60 g would be 0.0449 mol. another salt, for example, mgso4·7h2o (246.5 g/mol). 3.60 g is 0.0146 mol. not equimolar. maybe another pair. wait, maybe the salts are kclo4 and something else. not sure. alternatively, maybe the salts are kno3 and (nh4)2so4. let's think: kno3 decomposes to kno2 + 1⁄2 o2↑. (nh4)2so4 decomposes to h2so4 + 2 nh3↑. however, the products might not align with the observed gases. alternatively, maybe the salts are nano3 and cuso4·5h2o. wait, let's consider nano3: 2 nano3 → 2 nano2 + o2. that would produce o2. cuso4·5h2o loses water on heating, then maybe decomposes to cuo + so3. if so, then heating would produce h2o and so3. so if we have an equimolar mixture of nano3 and cuso4·5h2o: each salt would be 3.60 g. let's check molar masses: nano3: 23 + 14 + 48 = 85 g/mol. cuso4·5h2o: 159.6 + 90 = 249.6 g/mol. moles: nano3: 3.60 / 85 ≈ 0.0423 mol. cuso4·5h2o: 3.60 / 249.6 ≈ 0.0144 mol. not equimolar. so this can't be. alternatively, maybe the salts are kcl and kclo3. when heated, kclo3 decomposes to kcl + o2. but kcl doesn't decompose. however, if they are in an equimolar mixture, but that might not produce the right gases. alternatively, maybe one of the salts is (nh4)2cr2o7, which on heating decomposes to cr2o3 + 4 h2o + n2. the gases would be h2o and n2. h2o would be absorbed by tube 1, n2 would pass through and be the remaining gas. but where does o2 come from? alternatively, perhaps the salts are agno3 and kcl. but these are just salts. when heated, agno3 decomposes: 2 agno3 → 2 ag + 2 no2↑ + o2↑. kcl doesn't decompose. so the gases would be no2 and o2. no2 is an acidic gas and would be absorbed by tube 2 (ca(oh)2), causing an increase in weight. but in the problem, tube 2's weight doesn't change. therefore, this can't be. wait, perhaps the salts are na2so3 and nano3. heating na2so3 produces so2 and na2so4. nano3 decomposes to nano2 and o2. so the gases would be so2 and o2. but so2 is acidic and would be absorbed by tube 2, leading to weight gain. since tube 2's weight didn't change, this is not possible. alternatively, maybe the salts are nahco3 and nh4hco3. when heated, they decompose into co2, h2o, nh3. all these gases are acidic or basic and would be absorbed by tube 2. since tube 2's weight didn't change, this isn't possible. alternatively, maybe the salts are kclo3 and ki. however, when heated, kclo3 decomposes to kcl and o2. ki might not decompose. so only o2 would be produced, but then where does so3 come from? this seems incomplete. wait, going back. let's suppose that the total moles of gas produced are the sum of the gas absorbed in tube 1, the gas reacted in tube 3, and the gas remaining. that would be 0.045 mol (so3) + 0.025 mol (o2) + 0.1 mol (c) = 0.17 mol total gas. alternatively, maybe. but how does this relate to the moles of the salts? the problem states it's an equimolar mixture of salts a and b. let's assume each salt produces a certain gas upon heating. let’s denote: salt a → gas x salt b → gas y the mixture produces x and y in equimolar amounts. however, maybe x decomposes further? not sure. alternatively, the total moles of gas would be the sum of the moles of each gas. if the salts are equimolar, then moles of x and y should be equal. suppose each salt, when heated, produces n moles of gas. therefore, total moles of gas would be 2n. but the total moles we have from the problem is 0.045 + 0.025 + 0.1 = 0.17 moles. but 2n = 0.17? not sure. alternatively, perhaps each salt when heated produces multiple gases. for instance, salt a produces so3 and o2, and salt b produces o2 and another inert gas. but let's think with actual compounds. suppose salt a is (nh4)2so4 and salt b is kno3. when heated: (nh4)2so4 → h2so4 + 2 nh3↑ (but at higher temperatures, it might break down further). kno3 → kno2 + 1⁄2 o2↑. if we have an equimolar mixture, then moles of (nh4)2so4 = moles of kno3 = n. total gas produced: from (nh4)2so4: 2n nh3 (if complete decomposition) from kno3: n o2. but nh3 would be absorbed by tube 2 (ca(oh)2)), causing weight gain. but since tube 2's weight doesn't change, nh3 can't be present. so this can't be. alternatively, maybe the salts are mgso4·7h2o and pb(no3)2. when heated, mgso4·7h2o loses water: mgso4·7h2o → mgso4 + 7 h2o↑. pb(no3)2 decomposes: 2 pb(no3)2 → 2 pbo + 4 no2↑ + o2↑. so total gases would be h2o, no2, and o2. h2o is acidic? no, it's a neutral gas. but wait, h2o would be absorbed by mg(clo4)2 in tube 1? if tube 1 is a drying agent, then h2o would be absorbed. no2 is acidic and would be absorbed by tube 2 (ca(oh)2), leading to weight gain. but tube 2's weight doesn't change, so no2 can't be present. therefore, this can't be. alternatively, maybe the salts are kclo3 and (nh4)2so3. kclo3 → kcl + o2. (nh4)2so3 → (nh4)2so4 (under certain conditions) – not sure. maybe producing gases like so2? if so, so2 is acidic and would be absorbed by tube 2. not suitable. alternatively, maybe the salts are na2co3 and (nh4)2s. when heated: na2co3 → na2o + co2↑. (nh4)2s → 2 nh3↑ + h2s↑. co2 and h2s are acidic and would be absorbed by tube 2, leading to weight gain. since tube 2's weight didn't change, this can't be. wait, perhaps the salts are ag2so4 and kclo3. ag2so4 on heating might decompose into ag2o and so3. kclo3 decomposes to kcl and o2. thus: ag2so4 → ag2o + so3↑. kclo3 → kcl + o2↑. therefore, gases are so3 and o2. so3 is absorbed by tube 1 (mg(clo4)2), weight gain 3.60 g. o2 goes to tube 3, forming cuo and increasing weight by 0.80 g. then, what's the remaining gas? if ag2so4 and kclo3 are in equimolar ratio, and each produces 1 mole of gas per mole of salt, then the total gas moles would be sum of so3 and o2. wait, but if they are in equimolar amounts, and each mole produces 1 mole of gas, then total moles of gas would be 2n. but n is the moles of each salt. but how much is n? the total weight of salts is 7.20 g. molar masses: ag2so4: 2*107.87 + 32.07 + 4*16 = 215.74 + 32.07 + 64 = 311.81 g/mol. kclo3: 39.1 + 35.45 + 3*16 = 39.1 + 35.45 + 48 = 122.55 g/mol. if each is n moles, then: n*(311.81) + n*(122.55) = 7.20. n*(311.81 + 122.55) = 7.20. n = 7.20 / 434.36 ≈ 0.0166 mol. thus, total moles of gases would be 0.0166 moles of so3 + 0.0166 moles of o2 ≈ 0.0332 moles. but according to the problem, the total moles of gas should be 0.045 (so3) + 0.025 (o2) + 0.1 (remaining gas) = 0.17 moles. this is a discrepancy. therefore, this can't be. alternatively, maybe the salts are na2s2o3·5h2o and kbro3. when heated, na2s2o3·5h2o → na2s2o3 + 5 h2o. then na2s2o3 might decompose further. kbro3 might decompose to kbr + o2. but i'm not sure. alternatively, maybe the salts are h2so4 (concentrated) and kclo3. but these are not salts per se. alternatively, maybe the salts are na2o2 and mgso4. na2o2 reacts with water to produce o2, but when heated with mgso4... not sure. alternatively, think about the total moles of gases. total moles: 0.045 (from tube 1) + 0.025 (from tube 3) + 0.1 (remaining) = 0.17 moles. if the salts are in equimolar amounts, suppose each is 'n' moles. depending on the reaction stoichiometry, the total moles of gas could vary. if each salt produces a certain number of moles of gas. for instance, if salt a produces 3 moles of gas per mole, and salt b produces 1 mole per mole, then total gas moles would be 3n + 1n = 4n = 0.17 moles. but this is getting too convoluted. let's switch to considering the possible remaining gas c. since the remaining gas is 0.1 moles (0.1 mol) and tube 3 had a 0.80 g weight gain (which we associated with 0.025 moles of o2), and tube 1 had a 3.60 g gain (maybe so3, 0.045 moles), then total moles would be 0.045 + 0.025 + 0.1 = 0.17 moles. if
