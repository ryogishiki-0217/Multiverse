Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two stars, star_1 and star_2, and we're told that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. The photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), and we need to find the correct equation relating their effective temperatures, T_1 and T_2.
First, since the problem mentions excitation and energy levels, I should recall the Boltzmann distribution. In LTE, the ratio of the number densities of atoms in two different energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1) / (kT) ), where n2 and n1 are the number densities in the two levels, g2 and g1 are the degeneracies, E2 and E1 are the energy levels, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.
In this case, the problem says the atoms in star_1 are "twice as excited" in a specific energy level. I think this means the ratio of the number densities (n2/n1) is twice as high in star_1 compared to star_2. So, maybe for star_1, the ratio is 2 times that of star_2. Let me write that down: For star_1: n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - ΔE / (k T1) ) For star_2: n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - ΔE / (k T2) ) But the problem states that in star_1, this ratio is twice that of star_2. So, star_1's ratio is 2 times star_2's ratio. Therefore: (g2/g1) * exp( - ΔE / (k T1) ) = 2 * (g2/g1) * exp( - ΔE / (k T2) )
Since the degeneracies (g2/g1) are the same for both stars, we can divide both sides by (g2/g1), so they cancel out. That simplifies to: exp( - ΔE / (k T1) ) = 2 * exp( - ΔE / (k T2) )
Now, take natural logarithms (ln) of both sides to deal with the exponentials. Let's do that step by step. Starting with: exp( - ΔE / (k T1) ) = 2 * exp( - ΔE / (k T2) )
Let's divide both sides by exp( - ΔE / (k T2) ): exp( - ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) = 2
Simplify the exponent: exp( ΔE/k * (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2
Take the natural logarithm of both sides: ln(2) = ΔE/k * (1/T2 - 1/T1 )
Wait, but the problem states that in star_1, the excitation is TWICE that of star_2. So the ratio for star_1 is higher, meaning that star_1 has a higher temperature? Because higher temperature would mean more excited atoms in the higher energy levels. Wait, let's check that. The Boltzmann factor exp(-ΔE/(kT)) increases as T increases, because the exponent becomes smaller (less negative). So higher temperature means a higher ratio n2/n1. Therefore, star_1, which has twice the excitation, must have a higher temperature than star_2. So T1 > T2.
But let's get back to the equation. We have: ln(2) = ΔE/k * (1/T2 - 1/T1 )
Let me rearrange this. First, factor out the negative sign: ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * [ (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) ] = (ΔE/k) * [ (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ]
Wait, because (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Yes, that's right. Let's verify: To combine 1/T2 - 1/T1, we get (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Yes, because: 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)
Therefore, substituting back: ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2)
Now, the problem gives the energy difference ΔE = 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Let's note that the Boltzmann constant k is approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K. Wait, that's interesting. Because the energy difference ΔE is given as 1.38 x 10^(-23) J, which is exactly the value of k (Boltzmann constant) times 1 K. In other words, ΔE = k * 1 K. So, ΔE / k = 1 K. Wait, let's check that: If ΔE = 1.38 x 10^(-23) J, and k = 1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K, then ΔE / k = (1.38 x 10^(-23) J) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) J/K) ) = 1 K. So, ΔE / k = 1 K.
Therefore, substituting into the equation: ln(2) = (1 K) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2)
But since T1 and T2 are temperatures in Kelvin, and the term (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) would have units of 1/K. But multiplying by ΔE/k which is in units of K (since ΔE is in J and k is in J/K), the units would cancel, leaving a dimensionless quantity, which matches the left-hand side ln(2) being dimensionless. Wait, let's check the units: Wait, let me re-express the equation: ln(2) = [ΔE / k] * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) The term ΔE / k has units J / (J/K) ) = K. Then (T1 - T2) has units K, and (T1 T2) is (K * K). So the term (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) has units 1/K. Multiplying by K gives dimensionless. So, yes: K * (1/K) = dimensionless. That checks out. So, plugging in the numbers, since ΔE / k = 1 K, then: ln(2) = 1 K * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) But the left-hand side is dimensionless. Wait, that can't be. Wait, perhaps I need to check units more carefully. Because ln(2) is dimensionless. The right-hand side is (ΔE / k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Let's redo the units: ΔE has units J. k has units J/K. So ΔE / k has units J / (J/K) ) = K. Then (T1 - T2) has units K. Then (T1 T2) has units K^2. So, (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) has units 1/K. Therefore, when multiplied by K (from ΔE/k), the overall units are 1. So dimensionless. Therefore, that's correct. So, substituting ΔE/k = 1 K, we get: ln(2) = (1 K) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 K) ) The K cancels out, giving: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )
Therefore, the equation is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ), which matches option B: ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ]
Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are written as: A) ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) / (T1*T2)^2 ] B) ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) / (T1*T2) ] C) ln(2) = [ (T1 + T2) / (T1*T2) ] D) ln(2) = [ T2 / T1 ] So, according to the derivation, the correct equation is option B. Because after simplifying, we get ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), which is exactly option B.
Wait, but let me double-check. Starting again, the ratio of excited states is higher in star_1 by a factor of 2. So, n2/n1 (star_1) = 2 * n2/n1 (star_2). Using the Boltzmann factor, that gives: exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)). Then, rearranging: exp(-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2)) = 2. Which is: exp(ΔE/(k) [ -1/(T1) + 1/(T2) ]) = 2. Therefore, taking natural log: ln(2) = ΔE/k [ -1/T1 + 1/T2 ] = ΔE/k [ (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) ]. Then, as above, 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Therefore, substituting: ln(2) = ΔE/k * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Since ΔE = 1.38e-23 J and k = 1.38e-23 J/K, so ΔE/k = 1 K. Wait, that's actually incorrect. Wait, ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. So ΔE/k = 1.38e-23 J / 1.38e-23 J/K = 1 K. So, ΔE/k is 1 K. Therefore, substituting back into the equation: ln(2) = (1 K) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )
But the left-hand side is dimensionless. The right-hand side has units K * (K^-1) = dimensionless (since T is in K, (T1 - T2) is K, T1 T2 is K^2, so (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) is 1/K, multiplied by K gives dimensionless). So that works. Therefore, the equation simplifies to ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), which is option B. Therefore, the correct answer is B.
Wait, another way to think about it: The equation ln(2) = (ΔE / k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1 ). But since ΔE/k is 1 K^{-1} ? Wait, no. Wait, ΔE has units J, k has units J/K, so ΔE /k is units K, as we said before. But then the term (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) is in 1/K. So multiplying K by 1/K gives dimensionless. So, that's correct. So the equation is indeed ln(2) = (ΔE /k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1 ). But since ΔE/k is 1 K * (1/T2 - 1/T1 ). Wait, but this would have units of K * (1/K) = dimensionless. But 1/T2 - 1/T1 is 1/K. So, since ΔE/k is 1 K, multiplying gives: ln(2) = (1 K) * (1/K) = 1, which is dimensionless. But ln(2) is about 0.693, so that works. However, in the equation, we have ln(2) = (ΔE /k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1 ). Since ΔE/k is 1 K, then: ln(2) = 1 K * (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) (in units 1/K) ). So units cancel. Therefore, the equation is ln(2) = (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) * K. Wait, but T1 and T2 are in Kelvin. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating the units. Let me substitute numerical values hypothetically. Suppose T1 is 10,000 K and T2 is 5,000 K. Then (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = (5000)/(10,000*5,000) = 1/(10,000*2) = 1/(20,000) = 5e-5. Then ln(2) ≈ 0.693 ≈ 5e-5? That doesn't make sense. Wait, there must be something wrong here. Wait, but the problem states that the energy difference between the considered energy levels is 1.38e-23 J. Then, since k is 1.38e-23 J/K, so ΔE/k is 1 K^{-1}? Wait, no. Wait, ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. k = 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE / k = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K^{-1}. Wait, that's different. Oh, wait, no. If ΔE is in J, and k is in J/K, then ΔE / k has units J / (J/K) ) = K. So, ΔE / k is 1.38e-23 J / 1.38e-23 J/K = 1 K. So, ΔE / k = 1 K. Therefore, the equation ln(2) = (ΔE /k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) becomes ln(2) = (1 K) * (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) (in 1/K) ). Then units cancel. So ln(2) = 1 * (1/T2 - 1/T1 ). But T1 and T2 are temperatures in K, so (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) has units 1/K. Multiplying by K gives dimensionless. So that works. But in the equation, we have: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) But let's verify this. If ln(2) = (ΔE /k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1 ), and ΔE /k = 1 K, then: ln(2) = 1 K * (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) But 1/T2 - 1/T1 is equal to (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) in 1/K. So substituting: ln(2) = 1 K * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) (in 1/K ) So the K and 1/K cancel, resulting in ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), which is dimensionless. Because (T1 - T2) is in K, T1 T2 is in K^2, so (K)/(K^2) = 1/K. Then multiplying by K (from ΔE/k) gives dimensionless. So that works. So the equation is correct. Therefore, the answer is B.
**Final Answer** 
\boxed{B}

Answer: Two stars are being studied, where iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is \(1.38 \times 10^{-23}\) J. Assuming the stellar photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), we need to determine the correct equation relating their effective temperatures \(T_1\) and \(T_2\).

1. **Boltzmann Distribution**: The ratio of excited states in LTE is given by:
   \[
   \frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\Delta E / (kT)}
   \]
   For the same atom and energy levels, \(g_2/g_1\) is the same for both stars. The ratio of excited states for star_1 to star_2 is given as 2:
   \[
   \frac{n_2/n_1 \text{ (star_1)}}{n_2/n_1 \text{ (star_2)}} = 2 = \frac{e^{-\Delta E / (k T_1)}}{e^{-\Delta E / (k T_2)}}
   \]

2. **Simplifying the Ratio**:
   \[
   2 = e^{-\Delta E / (k T_1) + \Delta E / (k T_2)} = e^{\Delta E / k (1/T_2 - 1/T_1)}
   \]

3. **Taking Natural Logarithm**:
   \[
   \ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \right)
   \]

4. **Substitute \(\Delta E / k\)**:
   - Given \(\Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23}\) J and \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23}\) J/K, \(\Delta E / k = 1\) K.
   \[
   \ln(2) = 1 \times \left( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \right)
   \]

5. **Combine Terms**:
   \[
   \ln(2) = \left( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \right) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}
   \]

6. **Conclusion**: The correct equation is:
   \[
   \ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}
   \]

Thus, the correct answer is \(\boxed{B}\).

okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. so, we have two stars, star_1 and star_2, and we're told that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. the energy difference between the levels is 1.38 x 10^(-23) j. the photospheres are in local thermodynamic equilibrium (lte), and we need to find the correct equation relating their effective temperatures, t_1 and t_2.
first, since the problem mentions excitation and energy levels, i should recall the boltzmann distribution. in lte, the ratio of the number densities of atoms in two different energy levels is given by the boltzmann factor. the formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (e2 - e1) / (kt) ), where n2 and n1 are the number densities in the two levels, g2 and g1 are the degeneracies, e2 and e1 are the energy levels, k is the boltzmann constant, and t is the temperature.
in this case, the problem says the atoms in star_1 are "twice as excited" in a specific energy level. i think this means the ratio of the number densities (n2/n1) is twice as high in star_1 compared to star_2. so, maybe for star_1, the ratio is 2 times that of star_2. let me write that down: for star_1: n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - δe / (k t1) ) for star_2: n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - δe / (k t2) ) but the problem states that in star_1, this ratio is twice that of star_2. so, star_1's ratio is 2 times star_2's ratio. therefore: (g2/g1) * exp( - δe / (k t1) ) = 2 * (g2/g1) * exp( - δe / (k t2) )
since the degeneracies (g2/g1) are the same for both stars, we can divide both sides by (g2/g1), so they cancel out. that simplifies to: exp( - δe / (k t1) ) = 2 * exp( - δe / (k t2) )
now, take natural logarithms (ln) of both sides to deal with the exponentials. let's do that step by step. starting with: exp( - δe / (k t1) ) = 2 * exp( - δe / (k t2) )
let's divide both sides by exp( - δe / (k t2) ): exp( - δe/(k t1) + δe/(k t2) ) = 2
simplify the exponent: exp( δe/k * (1/t2 - 1/t1) ) = 2
take the natural logarithm of both sides: ln(2) = δe/k * (1/t2 - 1/t1 )
wait, but the problem states that in star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. so the ratio for star_1 is higher, meaning that star_1 has a higher temperature? because higher temperature would mean more excited atoms in the higher energy levels. wait, let's check that. the boltzmann factor exp(-δe/(kt)) increases as t increases, because the exponent becomes smaller (less negative). so higher temperature means a higher ratio n2/n1. therefore, star_1, which has twice the excitation, must have a higher temperature than star_2. so t1 > t2.
but let's get back to the equation. we have: ln(2) = δe/k * (1/t2 - 1/t1 )
let me rearrange this. first, factor out the negative sign: ln(2) = (δe/k) * [ (1/t2 - 1/t1 ) ] = (δe/k) * [ (t1 - t2)/(t1 t2) ]
wait, because (1/t2 - 1/t1) = (t1 - t2)/(t1 t2). yes, that's right. let's verify: to combine 1/t2 - 1/t1, we get (t1 - t2)/(t1 t2). yes, because: 1/t2 - 1/t1 = (t1 - t2)/(t1 t2)
therefore, substituting back: ln(2) = (δe / k) * (t1 - t2) / (t1 t2)
now, the problem gives the energy difference δe = 1.38 x 10^(-23) j. let's note that the boltzmann constant k is approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) j/k. wait, that's interesting. because the energy difference δe is given as 1.38 x 10^(-23) j, which is exactly the value of k (boltzmann constant) times 1 k. in other words, δe = k * 1 k. so, δe / k = 1 k. wait, let's check that: if δe = 1.38 x 10^(-23) j, and k = 1.38 x 10^(-23) j/k, then δe / k = (1.38 x 10^(-23) j) / (1.38 x 10^(-23) j/k) ) = 1 k. so, δe / k = 1 k.
therefore, substituting into the equation: ln(2) = (1 k) * (t1 - t2) / (t1 t2)
but since t1 and t2 are temperatures in kelvin, and the term (t1 - t2)/(t1 t2) would have units of 1/k. but multiplying by δe/k which is in units of k (since δe is in j and k is in j/k), the units would cancel, leaving a dimensionless quantity, which matches the left-hand side ln(2) being dimensionless. wait, let's check the units: wait, let me re-express the equation: ln(2) = [δe / k] * (t1 - t2)/(t1 t2) the term δe / k has units j / (j/k) ) = k. then (t1 - t2) has units k, and (t1 t2) is (k * k). so the term (t1 - t2)/(t1 t2) has units 1/k. multiplying by k gives dimensionless. so, yes: k * (1/k) = dimensionless. that checks out. so, plugging in the numbers, since δe / k = 1 k, then: ln(2) = 1 k * (t1 - t2)/(t1 t2) ) but the left-hand side is dimensionless. wait, that can't be. wait, perhaps i need to check units more carefully. because ln(2) is dimensionless. the right-hand side is (δe / k) * (t1 - t2)/(t1 t2). let's redo the units: δe has units j. k has units j/k. so δe / k has units j / (j/k) ) = k. then (t1 - t2) has units k. then (t1 t2) has units k^2. so, (t1 - t2)/(t1 t2) has units 1/k. therefore, when multiplied by k (from δe/k), the overall units are 1. so dimensionless. therefore, that's correct. so, substituting δe/k = 1 k, we get: ln(2) = (1 k) * (t1 - t2)/(t1 t2 k) ) the k cancels out, giving: ln(2) = (t1 - t2)/(t1 t2 )
therefore, the equation is ln(2) = (t1 - t2)/(t1 t2 ), which matches option b: ln(2) = [ (t1 - t2) / (t1 t2) ]
wait, but let me check the options again. the options are written as: a) ln(2) = [ (t1 - t2) / (t1*t2)^2 ] b) ln(2) = [ (t1 - t2) / (t1*t2) ] c) ln(2) = [ (t1 + t2) / (t1*t2) ] d) ln(2) = [ t2 / t1 ] so, according to the derivation, the correct equation is option b. because after simplifying, we get ln(2) = (t1 - t2)/(t1 t2), which is exactly option b.
wait, but let me double-check. starting again, the ratio of excited states is higher in star_1 by a factor of 2. so, n2/n1 (star_1) = 2 * n2/n1 (star_2). using the boltzmann factor, that gives: exp(-δe/(k t1)) = 2 * exp(-δe/(k t2)). then, rearranging: exp(-δe/(k t1) + δe/(k t2)) = 2. which is: exp(δe/(k) [ -1/(t1) + 1/(t2) ]) = 2. therefore, taking natural log: ln(2) = δe/k [ -1/t1 + 1/t2 ] = δe/k [ (1/t2 - 1/t1 ) ]. then, as above, 1/t2 - 1/t1 = (t1 - t2)/(t1 t2). therefore, substituting: ln(2) = δe/k * (t1 - t2)/(t1 t2). since δe = 1.38e-23 j and k = 1.38e-23 j/k, so δe/k = 1 k. wait, that's actually incorrect. wait, δe is given as 1.38e-23 j. so δe/k = 1.38e-23 j / 1.38e-23 j/k = 1 k. so, δe/k is 1 k. therefore, substituting back into the equation: ln(2) = (1 k) * (t1 - t2)/(t1 t2 )
but the left-hand side is dimensionless. the right-hand side has units k * (k^-1) = dimensionless (since t is in k, (t1 - t2) is k, t1 t2 is k^2, so (t1 - t2)/(t1 t2) is 1/k, multiplied by k gives dimensionless). so that works. therefore, the equation simplifies to ln(2) = (t1 - t2)/(t1 t2), which is option b. therefore, the correct answer is b.
wait, another way to think about it: the equation ln(2) = (δe / k) * (1/t2 - 1/t1 ). but since δe/k is 1 k^{-1} ? wait, no. wait, δe has units j, k has units j/k, so δe /k is units k, as we said before. but then the term (1/t2 - 1/t1 ) is in 1/k. so multiplying k by 1/k gives dimensionless. so, that's correct. so the equation is indeed ln(2) = (δe /k) * (1/t2 - 1/t1 ). but since δe/k is 1 k * (1/t2 - 1/t1 ). wait, but this would have units of k * (1/k) = dimensionless. but 1/t2 - 1/t1 is 1/k. so, since δe/k is 1 k, multiplying gives: ln(2) = (1 k) * (1/k) = 1, which is dimensionless. but ln(2) is about 0.693, so that works. however, in the equation, we have ln(2) = (δe /k) * (1/t2 - 1/t1 ). since δe/k is 1 k, then: ln(2) = 1 k * (1/t2 - 1/t1 ) (in units 1/k) ). so units cancel. therefore, the equation is ln(2) = (1/t2 - 1/t1 ) * k. wait, but t1 and t2 are in kelvin. wait, perhaps i'm overcomplicating the units. let me substitute numerical values hypothetically. suppose t1 is 10,000 k and t2 is 5,000 k. then (t1 - t2)/(t1 t2) = (5000)/(10,000*5,000) = 1/(10,000*2) = 1/(20,000) = 5e-5. then ln(2) ≈ 0.693 ≈ 5e-5? that doesn't make sense. wait, there must be something wrong here. wait, but the problem states that the energy difference between the considered energy levels is 1.38e-23 j. then, since k is 1.38e-23 j/k, so δe/k is 1 k^{-1}? wait, no. wait, δe = 1.38e-23 j. k = 1.38e-23 j/k. so δe / k = (1.38e-23 j) / (1.38e-23 j/k) ) = 1 k^{-1}. wait, that's different. oh, wait, no. if δe is in j, and k is in j/k, then δe / k has units j / (j/k) ) = k. so, δe / k is 1.38e-23 j / 1.38e-23 j/k = 1 k. so, δe / k = 1 k. therefore, the equation ln(2) = (δe /k) * (1/t2 - 1/t1 ) becomes ln(2) = (1 k) * (1/t2 - 1/t1 ) (in 1/k) ). then units cancel. so ln(2) = 1 * (1/t2 - 1/t1 ). but t1 and t2 are temperatures in k, so (1/t2 - 1/t1 ) has units 1/k. multiplying by k gives dimensionless. so that works. but in the equation, we have: ln(2) = (t1 - t2)/(t1 t2) but let's verify this. if ln(2) = (δe /k) * (1/t2 - 1/t1 ), and δe /k = 1 k, then: ln(2) = 1 k * (1/t2 - 1/t1 ) but 1/t2 - 1/t1 is equal to (t1 - t2)/(t1 t2) in 1/k. so substituting: ln(2) = 1 k * (t1 - t2)/(t1 t2) (in 1/k ) so the k and 1/k cancel, resulting in ln(2) = (t1 - t2)/(t1 t2), which is dimensionless. because (t1 - t2) is in k, t1 t2 is in k^2, so (k)/(k^2) = 1/k. then multiplying by k (from δe/k) gives dimensionless. so that works. so the equation is correct. therefore, the answer is b.
**final answer** 
\boxed{b}

answer: two stars are being studied, where iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. the energy difference between the levels is \(1.38 \times 10^{-23}\) j. assuming the stellar photospheres are in local thermodynamic equilibrium (lte), we need to determine the correct equation relating their effective temperatures \(t_1\) and \(t_2\).

1. **boltzmann distribution**: the ratio of excited states in lte is given by:
   \[
   \frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\delta e / (kt)}
   \]
   for the same atom and energy levels, \(g_2/g_1\) is the same for both stars. the ratio of excited states for star_1 to star_2 is given as 2:
   \[
   \frac{n_2/n_1 \text{ (star_1)}}{n_2/n_1 \text{ (star_2)}} = 2 = \frac{e^{-\delta e / (k t_1)}}{e^{-\delta e / (k t_2)}}
   \]

2. **simplifying the ratio**:
   \[
   2 = e^{-\delta e / (k t_1) + \delta e / (k t_2)} = e^{\delta e / k (1/t_2 - 1/t_1)}
   \]

3. **taking natural logarithm**:
   \[
   \ln(2) = \frac{\delta e}{k} \left( \frac{1}{t_2} - \frac{1}{t_1} \right)
   \]

4. **substitute \(\delta e / k\)**:
   - given \(\delta e = 1.38 \times 10^{-23}\) j and \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23}\) j/k, \(\delta e / k = 1\) k.
   \[
   \ln(2) = 1 \times \left( \frac{1}{t_2} - \frac{1}{t_1} \right)
   \]

5. **combine terms**:
   \[
   \ln(2) = \left( \frac{1}{t_2} - \frac{1}{t_1} \right) = \frac{t_1 - t_2}{t_1 t_2}
   \]

6. **conclusion**: the correct equation is:
   \[
   \ln(2) = \frac{t_1 - t_2}{t_1 t_2}
   \]

thus, the correct answer is \(\boxed{b}\)
