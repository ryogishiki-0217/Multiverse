Okay, let's see. So the problem is about particles being collided in a spherical detector. These collisions produce new particles that move really fast, with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the detector's inner walls. The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed to get about two thirds of the particles to reach the walls. The radius of the detector is 30 meters.
First, I need to recall what the Lorentz factor (γ) is. It's a concept from special relativity, related to the speed of the particle. The Lorentz factor is given by γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v2/c2)), where v is the speed of the particle and c is the speed of light.
Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their speeds are very close to the speed of light. So a higher Lorentz factor means the particle is going even closer to the speed of light.
But how does the Lorentz factor affect the fraction of particles reaching the detector walls? Hmm. The problem mentions that these particles are fast-decaying. So, their lifetime is short. However, from special relativity, the lifetime of a particle moving at a high speed is dilated in the lab frame. That means, in the lab frame, the particle lives longer than its proper lifetime (the lifetime measured in its own rest frame). So, if the Lorentz factor is higher, the lifetime in the lab frame is longer (since γ is higher), meaning the particle travels a longer distance before decaying.
So, the idea here is that with a higher Lorentz factor, the particles live longer in the lab frame, so they travel farther before decaying. Therefore, a greater fraction of them reach the detector walls. Conversely, if the Lorentz factor is lower, their lifetime in the lab frame is shorter, so they decay before reaching the walls.
So, the problem is connecting the Lorentz factor to the fraction of particles that reach the walls.
Let me formalize this. Let's assume the proper lifetime of the particles is τ (in their rest frame). Then, in the lab frame, the lifetime is γτ. During this time, the particle travels a distance equal to v multiplied by the lab frame lifetime. So, the distance traveled in the lab frame is v * γτ.
But since the particles are ultra-relativistic, we can approximate v ≈ c. So, the distance traveled would be approximately c * γτ.
Now, the radius of the detector is 30 meters. So, if the distance traveled by the particle in the lab frame is greater than or equal to 30 meters, it will reach the wall. Otherwise, it will decay before reaching the wall.
Therefore, the condition for a particle to reach the wall is c * γτ ≥ 30 meters.
But we need to relate this to the fraction of particles that reach the wall. Since all particles are produced at the center, the ones that reach the wall are those for which their range (distance traveled) is at least 30 meters.
However, the problem says that currently, with a Lorentz factor of ~20, one third of the particles reach the walls. So, using this information, we can find some relationship between γ, τ, and the radius.
Let me write down the equation for the current situation:
For γ1 = 20, the fraction reaching the wall is 1/3.
So, the distance traveled is c * γ1 * τ.
The probability that a particle reaches the wall is the integral from 30 meters to infinity of the decay probability distribution. But since the decay is exponential, the probability that the particle decays after traveling a distance x is e^(-x/(mean path length)).
Wait, in special relativity, the mean lifetime in the lab frame is γτ, so the mean path length (mean distance traveled) is vγτ. Since v ≈ c, that's approximately cγτ.
Therefore, the distribution of the distance traveled by the particle in the lab frame is an exponential distribution with mean cγτ.
Therefore, the probability that a particle travels a distance greater than 30 meters (the radius of the detector) is e^(-30/(cγτ)).
But the problem states that this probability is 1/3 when γ = 20.
So:
1/3 = e^(-30/(c * 20 * τ))
Taking natural logarithm on both sides:
ln(1/3) = -30/(c * 20 * τ)
Which simplifies to:
-1.0986 ≈ -30/(20cτ)
Multiply both sides by -1:
1.0986 ≈ 30/(20cτ)
Simplify the right side:
30/(20cτ) = 3/(2cτ)
So, 1.0986 ≈ 3/(2cτ)
Therefore, we can solve for cτ:
cτ ≈ 3/(2 * 1.0986) ≈ 3 / 2.1972 ≈ 1.366
So, cτ ≈ 1.366
Wait, but cτ is a product. Wait, τ is the proper lifetime, right? So, cτ is the distance that the particle would travel in its own rest frame during its lifetime, but since in the rest frame v=0, this is just zero. Wait, maybe I need to be careful here.
Wait, actually, in the lab frame, the lifetime is γτ, and the distance traveled is βγcτ, where β = v/c. For ultra-relativistic particles, β ≈ 1, so distance ≈ γcτ.
So the equation becomes:
Probability of decaying after distance x is e^(-x/(γcτ)), right?
Wait, actually, the path length distribution for relativistic particles is a bit different. Since the particles are moving at speed v, the time to reach the wall is t = R/v. So, the proper time in the lab frame is γτ, so the condition is whether t >= γτ.
Wait, maybe another approach is necessary.
Alternatively, the lifetime in the lab frame is γτ. During that time, the particle travels a distance v * γτ. If that distance is greater than or equal to R (30 meters), then the particle will reach the wall. Otherwise, it decays sooner.
Wait, but if the distance traveled in the lab frame is vγτ, and the required distance is R, then the probability that the particle travels at least R is step function: if vγτ >= R then probability 1, else probability 0. But this contradicts the problem statement where at γ=20, the probability is 1/3. So this can't be a step function.
Therefore, perhaps the decay follows an exponential distribution. The mean lifetime in the lab frame is γτ. The distance traveled is speed multiplied by the time. So, the expected distance is vγτ. But the actual distance traveled by a decaying particle is a random variable, with exponential distribution.
Therefore, the probability that a particle's lifetime in the lab frame is longer than the time it takes to reach the wall.
The time to reach the wall is R / v.
So, the probability is S = P(t > R/v), where t is the lifetime in the lab frame.
Since t follows an exponential distribution with mean γτ, the probability is e^(-R/(vγτ)).
Wait, this seems consistent with what I had before.
So, setting this equal to 1/3 when γ = 20:
1/3 = e^(-30/(v * 20 * τ))
But since the particles are ultra-relativistic, v ≈ c. So, we can approximate v = c.
Therefore:
1/3 = e^(-30/(c * 20 * τ))
Take natural logarithm:
ln(1/3) = -30/(20cτ)
Which simplifies:
-1.0986 ≈ -30/(20cτ)
Multiply both sides by -1:
1.0986 ≈ 30/(20cτ)
Multiply both sides by 20cτ:
1.0986 * 20cτ = 30
Therefore:
20cτ = 30 / 1.0986 ≈ 27.295
So:
cτ ≈ 27.295 / 20 ≈ 1.3647
So, cτ ≈ 1.3647
So this gives us the product cτ. Note that τ is the proper lifetime of the particle.
Now, the question is asking for the Lorentz factor needed to have about two thirds of the particles reach the wall.
So, we need to find γ such that the probability P(t > R/v) = 1 - e^(-R/(vγτ)) ≈ 2/3.
Wait, wait. Wait, the probability that the particle decays after time R/v is e^(-R/(vγτ)). Wait, actually, if the lifetime in the lab frame is t ~ Exponential(1/(γτ)), then the probability that t > R/v is e^(-R/(vγτ)). Therefore, the survival probability.
Therefore, we need e^(-R/(vγτ)) = 2/3.
Wait, wait. Wait, actually, if the particles decay, the fraction reaching the wall is the probability that their lifetime in the lab frame is longer than the time it takes to cross the distance R. So, that's e^(-R/(vγτ)) = 2/3.
Wait, but in the original case, when γ=20, the fraction is 1/3. So, if we set it up as:
Fraction reaching wall = e^(-R/(vγτ))
Then, when γ=20, e^(-30/(20cτ)) = 1/3.
Which is the same equation as before.
So, solving for cτ, as we did earlier, gives cτ ≈ 1.3647
Then, for the new Lorentz factor γ', we need e^(-30/(γ' * cτ)) = 2/3.
Wait, but we need to be careful with the velocity here. Since the velocity is given as ultra-relativistic, but dependent on the Lorentz factor. The Lorentz factor is γ' = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v'^2/c2)).
Therefore, v' = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(γ'^2)).
For high γ', this is approximately v' ≈ c (1 - 1/(2γ'^2)) (using a binomial approximation).
However, since we are dealing with velocity in the exponent, perhaps we need to express v in terms of γ.
So, R/(vγτ) = 30/(vγ * 1.3647/c), assuming cτ = 1.3647 as before.
Wait, perhaps this is getting too confusing. Let me instead express everything in terms of γ.
Given that cτ = 1.3647 (from the initial condition with γ=20), then τ = 1.3647 / c.
But we need to relate the distance R to v and τ.
Alternatively, let's note that in the lab frame, the lifetime of the particle is γ * τ. The distance it travels is v * γ * τ.
Therefore, the condition for the particle to reach the wall is v * γ * τ >= R.
However, since the decay is probabilistic, the fraction that reaches the wall is the survival probability, which for an exponential distribution is e^(-R / (v γ τ)}.
Wait, that seems to conflict with our previous equation. Wait, why?
Wait, the time to reach the wall is t_wall = R / v.
The lifetime in the lab frame is γ τ.
So, the probability that the particle lives longer than t_wall is:
P = e^(- t_wall / (γ τ)) = e^(- R / (v γ τ))
But in our initial setup, when γ=20, this P is 1/3.
So,
1/3 = e^(-30 / (v * 20 * τ))
But we need to express this in terms of c and τ.
Since v = c * β, where β is close to 1.
But if we use γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β2), then for high γ, β ≈ 1 - 1/(2 γ2).
So, approximately, β ≈ 1 - 1/(2 γ2), so v ≈ c (1 - 1/(2 γ2))
But perhaps we can relate v and τ through the relation we found earlier.
Wait, but we have cτ ≈ 1.3647, so τ ≈ 1.3647 / c.
Plugging into the equation:
1/3 = e^(-30 / (v * 20 * τ)) = e^(-30 / (v * 20 * 1.3647 / c)) )
But v is in meters per second, c is meters per second, so let me arrange the terms:
Let me rewrite the exponent as:
-30 / (v * 20 * 1.3647 / c) = -30 * c / (v * 20 * 1.3647)
But v = β c, so substituting:
= -30 * c / (β c * 20 * 1.3647) ) = -30 / (β * 20 * 1.3647)
= -30 / (20 * 1.3647 * β ) = -30 / (27.294 * β )
But we can compute 27.294: 20 * 1.3647 = 27.294
So, the exponent is -30 / (27.294 * β )
But when γ=20, β is approximately 1 - 1/(2*202) = 1 - 1/800 ≈ 0.99875.
But let's compute β for γ=20:
γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β2) => sqrt(1 - β2) = 1/γ => 1 - β2 = 1/γ2 => β2 = 1 - 1/γ2 => β = sqrt(1 - 1/400) ≈ sqrt(399/400) ≈ 0.9975.
Wait, so β ≈ 0.9975 for γ=20.
Therefore, plugging into the exponent:
-30 / (27.294 * 0.9975) ≈ -30 / 27.22 ≈ -1.101
And e^{-1.101} ≈ 1/3, which matches since e^{-1.1} ≈ 0.332, which is close to 1/3.
So that works.
But the problem is that we don't know the exact velocity, but we can relate β to γ through the Lorentz factor.
But given that the problem states the Lorentz factor is ~20, and in the new case, we need to find a new Lorentz factor such that the fraction becomes 2/3.
So, we need to set up the equation for the new γ:
2/3 = e^(-30 / (v' * γ' * τ))
Again, using τ = 1.3647 / c, and v' = β' c.
So,
2/3 = e^(-30 / (β' c * γ' * 1.3647 / c)) = e^(-30 / (β' γ' * 1.3647) )
So, exponent is -30 / (1.3647 β' γ') = -30 / (1.3647 * β' γ') ≈ -22.058 / (β' γ')
So, ln(2/3) ≈ -0.4055 = -22.058 / (β' γ')
Therefore,
22.058 / (β' γ') ≈ 0.4055 => β' γ' ≈ 22.058 / 0.4055 ≈ 54.4
So, β' γ' ≈ 54.4
But we need to relate β' and γ'.
Since γ' = 1 / sqrt(1 - β'^2), we can express β' in terms of γ'.
From γ' = 1 / sqrt(1 - β'^2), we get sqrt(1 - β'^2) = 1/γ'
Square both sides: 1 - β'^2 = 1/γ'^2
Therefore, β'^2 = 1 - 1/γ'^2
So, β' = sqrt(1 - 1/γ'^2)
Thus, β' γ' = sqrt(1 - 1/γ'^2) * γ' = sqrt( γ'^2 (1 - 1/γ'^2) ) = sqrt( γ'^2 - 1 )
Therefore, β' γ' = sqrt(γ'^2 - 1)
So, according to the previous result, sqrt(γ'^2 - 1) ≈ 54.4
Therefore, solving for γ':
sqrt(γ'^2 - 1) ≈ 54.4
Square both sides:
γ'^2 - 1 ≈ 54.42 ≈ 2959.36
Therefore, γ'^2 ≈ 2959.36 + 1 ≈ 2960.36
Therefore, γ' ≈ sqrt(2960.36) ≈ 54.4
Wait, but that gives γ' ≈ 54.4, but the options are A) 40, B) 54, C) 28, D) 68.
So, approximately 54.4, so option B) 54.
Wait, but let's check the exact calculation.
Wait, earlier steps:
We had for the initial condition:
ln(1/3) ≈ -1.0986 = -30/(20 * c τ * β )
Which led to c τ ≈ 3/(2 * 1.0986 * β )
But wait, maybe I approximated β as 1 before? If so, that could be a mistake.
Because when we computed cτ ≈1.3647, we didn't take into account β. But in reality, since β is approximately 0.9975 for γ=20, then:
c τ = (30 / (20 * β * 1.0986)) ) Wait, let me re-examine that step.
Starting again from the first equation:
ln(1/3) = -1.0986 = -30/(v * 20 * τ )
But v = β c, so:
-1.0986 = -30/(β c * 20 * τ )
Multiply both sides by -1:
1.0986 = 30/(20 * β c τ )
Multiply both sides by 20 * β c τ:
20 * β c τ * 1.0986 = 30
Therefore,
β c τ = 30 / (20 * 1.0986 ) ≈ 30 / 21.972 ≈ 1.366
So, c τ β ≈ 1.366
But earlier, when we didn't account for β, we got c τ ≈ 1.366. But now, with β included, this expression is c τ β ≈ 1.366.
But since β is approximately 1 for high γ, this value is still approximately c τ. However, when we need to calculate for a different γ, we have to take into account that β also depends on γ.
Wait, this is getting complicated, maybe there's a better way.
Wait, the key relation we have is that for the original case (γ=20), we have:
β_1 c τ ≈ 1.366
Where β_1 is the velocity factor for γ=20.
For the new γ, we need to find γ' such that the fraction reaching the wall is 2/3.
The equation for the new fraction is:
ln(2/3) ≈ -0.4055 = -30/(v' * γ' * τ )
Again, substituting v' = β' c, τ = 1.366/(β c ) from the original condition? Wait, maybe not.
Wait, if in the original case, β_1 c τ = 1.366, then τ = 1.366 / (β_1 c )
But τ is the proper lifetime, which is a constant. So for different velocities, β changes, but τ is the same. So, actually, we can use τ = 1.366 / (β_1 c )
But since γ is related to β via γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β^2), we can express τ in terms of γ.
Wait, perhaps not necessary. Let's proceed.
Given that β_1 = sqrt(1 - 1/γ_1^2) for γ_1=20, so β_1 ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/400) ≈ 0.9975 as before.
So, β_1 ≈ 0.9975.
Thus, τ = 1.366 / (β_1 c ) ≈ 1.366 / (0.9975 c ) ≈ 1.369 / c.
But for the new γ', we have β' = sqrt(1 - 1/γ'^2), and we need to find γ' such that:
ln(2/3) = -30/( β' c γ' τ )
But τ is the same as above, since the proper lifetime doesn't change. So substituting τ:
ln(2/3) = -30/( β' c γ' * (1.366 / (β_1 c )) )
Wait, because τ = 1.366 / (β_1 c ) from the first equation. So,
= -30/( β' c γ' * 1.366 / (β_1 c ) )
The c cancels:
= -30/( β' γ' * 1.366 / β_1 )
So,
= -30 * β_1 / (1.366 β' γ' )
Thus,
-0.4055 ≈ -30 * 0.9975 / (1.366 β' γ' )
Simplify the right-hand side:
30 * 0.9975 ≈ 29.925
1.366 * β' γ' * 0.4055 ≈ 29.925
Wait, wait. Wait, let me re-examine the equation:
ln(2/3) ≈ -0.4055 ≈ -30 * β_1 / (1.366 β' γ' )
Thus, removing the negative sign:
0.4055 ≈ 30 * 0.9975 / (1.366 β' γ' )
Multiply both sides by the denominator:
0.4055 * 1.366 β' γ' ≈ 30 * 0.9975
Calculate 30 * 0.9975 ≈ 29.925
Calculate 0.4055 * 1.366 ≈ 0.553
Thus:
0.553 β' γ' ≈ 29.925
Therefore, β' γ' ≈ 29.925 / 0.553 ≈ 54.1
Which is the same as before.
But we also know that β' γ' = sqrt(γ'^2 - 1 )
Therefore, sqrt(γ'^2 -1 ) ≈ 54.1
Thus, squaring both sides:
γ'^2 - 1 ≈ 54.1^2 ≈ 2926
Therefore, γ'^2 ≈ 2927
Thus, γ' ≈ sqrt(2927 ) ≈ 54.1
Wait, but 54.1 squared is 54.1 * 54.1. 54^2=2916, 54.1^2= (54 + 0.1)^2= 54^2 + 2*54*0.1 +0.1^2=2916 +10.8 +0.01=2926.81
Therefore, sqrt(2927) ≈ 54.099, which is approximately 54.1.
Therefore, the required γ' is approximately 54.1.
Looking at the options, B) 54, C) 28, D) 68.
So the closest answer is 54, option B.
But wait, let me check again.
Wait, but in the calculation above, we arrived at γ' ≈ 54.1, which is very close to option B) 54.
Therefore, the answer should be B) 54.
Wait, but maybe we can do a sanity check.
If the required Lorentz factor is about 54, that's more than double the original γ of 20.
But why? Because in the equation we had to get βγ to be about 54, and since sqrt(γ^2 -1 ) ≈ βγ, then γ is approximately 54.
Alternatively, perhaps there is an error in the assumption that the survival probability is e^(-R/(vγτ)). But according to the exponential distribution for relativistic particles, this seems correct.
Alternatively, another approach could be considering the relation between the Lorentz factor and the fraction.
Since the fraction reaching the wall is e^(-R/(vγτ)), and taking into account that τ is related to the original condition, we can set up a ratio.
Let’s denote for the first case (γ=20, fraction=1/3):
1/3 = e^(-30/(c * γ1 * τ))
For the second case (γ=γ2, fraction=2/3):
2/3 = e^(-30/(c * γ2 * τ))
Taking the ratio or combining the equations.
Let me take the natural log of both equations:
For the first case:
ln(1/3) = -30/(c γ1 τ )
For the second case:
ln(2/3) = -30/(c γ2 τ )
Thus, dividing the two equations:
ln(1/3) / ln(2/3) = (-30/(c γ1 τ )) / (-30/(c γ2 τ )) )
Simplifies to:
ln(1/3) / ln(2/3) = γ2 / γ1
Calculate ln(1/3) ≈ -1.0986
ln(2/3) ≈ -0.4055
Therefore, (-1.0986)/(-0.4055) ≈ 2.71
Thus, 2.71 ≈ γ2 / γ1
Therefore, γ2 ≈ 2.71 * γ1 ≈ 2.71 * 20 ≈ 54.2
Which is very close to the previous result, approximately 54.2, so 54.
Therefore, the answer is B) 54.
Therefore, boxed answer is \boxed{B}

Answer: Given that particles produced in a spherical detector with a radius of 30 meters have a Lorentz factor of ~20, and one third of these particles reach the detector walls, we need to determine the Lorentz factor required for two thirds of the particles to reach the walls.

1. **Understanding Lorentz Factor and Relativistic Lifetime**: The Lorentz factor (\(\gamma\)) relates to the lifetime dilation of fast-decaying particles. A higher \(\gamma\) means a longer lifetime in the lab frame, allowing particles to travel farther before decaying.

2. **Exponential Decay Probability**: The probability of a particle decaying after traveling a distance \(x\) is given by \(e^{-x / (v \gamma \tau)}\), where \(v\) is the particle's velocity, \(\gamma\) is the Lorentz factor, and \(\tau\) is the proper lifetime.

3. **Given Condition**: For \(\gamma = 20\), the fraction of particles reaching the wall (30 meters) is \(1/3\). This gives the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} = e^{-30 / (v \cdot 20 \cdot \tau)}
   \]
   Taking natural logarithms:
   \[
   \ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{30}{v \cdot 20 \cdot \tau}
   \]
   Simplifying, we find \(c \tau \approx 1.366\).

4. **New Condition**: For the fraction to be \(2/3\):
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} = e^{-30 / (v' \cdot \gamma' \cdot \tau)}
   \]
   Taking natural logarithms:
   \[
   \ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{30}{v' \cdot \gamma' \cdot \tau}
   \]

5. **Relating Velocities and Lorentz Factors**: Using the relationship \(v = c \sqrt{1 - 1/\gamma^2}\) and approximating for high \(\gamma\), we find:
   \[
   \beta \gamma = \sqrt{\gamma^2 - 1}
   \]

6. **Solving for \(\gamma'\)**:
   - From the given condition: \(\sqrt{20^2 - 1} \approx 19.97\)
   - From the new condition: \(\sqrt{\gamma'^2 - 1} \approx 54.1\)
   - Solving \(\gamma'^2 - 1 \approx 54.1^2\), we find \(\gamma' \approx 54.1\).

Thus, the required Lorentz factor is approximately 54, leading to the answer:

\boxed{B}

okay, let's see. so the problem is about particles being collided in a spherical detector. these collisions produce new particles that move really fast, with a lorentz factor of about 20. on average, one third of these particles reach the detector's inner walls. the question is asking what lorentz factor is needed to get about two thirds of the particles to reach the walls. the radius of the detector is 30 meters.
first, i need to recall what the lorentz factor (γ) is. it's a concept from special relativity, related to the speed of the particle. the lorentz factor is given by γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v2/c2)), where v is the speed of the particle and c is the speed of light.
since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their speeds are very close to the speed of light. so a higher lorentz factor means the particle is going even closer to the speed of light.
but how does the lorentz factor affect the fraction of particles reaching the detector walls? hmm. the problem mentions that these particles are fast-decaying. so, their lifetime is short. however, from special relativity, the lifetime of a particle moving at a high speed is dilated in the lab frame. that means, in the lab frame, the particle lives longer than its proper lifetime (the lifetime measured in its own rest frame). so, if the lorentz factor is higher, the lifetime in the lab frame is longer (since γ is higher), meaning the particle travels a longer distance before decaying.
so, the idea here is that with a higher lorentz factor, the particles live longer in the lab frame, so they travel farther before decaying. therefore, a greater fraction of them reach the detector walls. conversely, if the lorentz factor is lower, their lifetime in the lab frame is shorter, so they decay before reaching the walls.
so, the problem is connecting the lorentz factor to the fraction of particles that reach the walls.
let me formalize this. let's assume the proper lifetime of the particles is τ (in their rest frame). then, in the lab frame, the lifetime is γτ. during this time, the particle travels a distance equal to v multiplied by the lab frame lifetime. so, the distance traveled in the lab frame is v * γτ.
but since the particles are ultra-relativistic, we can approximate v ≈ c. so, the distance traveled would be approximately c * γτ.
now, the radius of the detector is 30 meters. so, if the distance traveled by the particle in the lab frame is greater than or equal to 30 meters, it will reach the wall. otherwise, it will decay before reaching the wall.
therefore, the condition for a particle to reach the wall is c * γτ ≥ 30 meters.
but we need to relate this to the fraction of particles that reach the wall. since all particles are produced at the center, the ones that reach the wall are those for which their range (distance traveled) is at least 30 meters.
however, the problem says that currently, with a lorentz factor of ~20, one third of the particles reach the walls. so, using this information, we can find some relationship between γ, τ, and the radius.
let me write down the equation for the current situation:
for γ1 = 20, the fraction reaching the wall is 1/3.
so, the distance traveled is c * γ1 * τ.
the probability that a particle reaches the wall is the integral from 30 meters to infinity of the decay probability distribution. but since the decay is exponential, the probability that the particle decays after traveling a distance x is e^(-x/(mean path length)).
wait, in special relativity, the mean lifetime in the lab frame is γτ, so the mean path length (mean distance traveled) is vγτ. since v ≈ c, that's approximately cγτ.
therefore, the distribution of the distance traveled by the particle in the lab frame is an exponential distribution with mean cγτ.
therefore, the probability that a particle travels a distance greater than 30 meters (the radius of the detector) is e^(-30/(cγτ)).
but the problem states that this probability is 1/3 when γ = 20.
so:
1/3 = e^(-30/(c * 20 * τ))
taking natural logarithm on both sides:
ln(1/3) = -30/(c * 20 * τ)
which simplifies to:
-1.0986 ≈ -30/(20cτ)
multiply both sides by -1:
1.0986 ≈ 30/(20cτ)
simplify the right side:
30/(20cτ) = 3/(2cτ)
so, 1.0986 ≈ 3/(2cτ)
therefore, we can solve for cτ:
cτ ≈ 3/(2 * 1.0986) ≈ 3 / 2.1972 ≈ 1.366
so, cτ ≈ 1.366
wait, but cτ is a product. wait, τ is the proper lifetime, right? so, cτ is the distance that the particle would travel in its own rest frame during its lifetime, but since in the rest frame v=0, this is just zero. wait, maybe i need to be careful here.
wait, actually, in the lab frame, the lifetime is γτ, and the distance traveled is βγcτ, where β = v/c. for ultra-relativistic particles, β ≈ 1, so distance ≈ γcτ.
so the equation becomes:
probability of decaying after distance x is e^(-x/(γcτ)), right?
wait, actually, the path length distribution for relativistic particles is a bit different. since the particles are moving at speed v, the time to reach the wall is t = r/v. so, the proper time in the lab frame is γτ, so the condition is whether t >= γτ.
wait, maybe another approach is necessary.
alternatively, the lifetime in the lab frame is γτ. during that time, the particle travels a distance v * γτ. if that distance is greater than or equal to r (30 meters), then the particle will reach the wall. otherwise, it decays sooner.
wait, but if the distance traveled in the lab frame is vγτ, and the required distance is r, then the probability that the particle travels at least r is step function: if vγτ >= r then probability 1, else probability 0. but this contradicts the problem statement where at γ=20, the probability is 1/3. so this can't be a step function.
therefore, perhaps the decay follows an exponential distribution. the mean lifetime in the lab frame is γτ. the distance traveled is speed multiplied by the time. so, the expected distance is vγτ. but the actual distance traveled by a decaying particle is a random variable, with exponential distribution.
therefore, the probability that a particle's lifetime in the lab frame is longer than the time it takes to reach the wall.
the time to reach the wall is r / v.
so, the probability is s = p(t > r/v), where t is the lifetime in the lab frame.
since t follows an exponential distribution with mean γτ, the probability is e^(-r/(vγτ)).
wait, this seems consistent with what i had before.
so, setting this equal to 1/3 when γ = 20:
1/3 = e^(-30/(v * 20 * τ))
but since the particles are ultra-relativistic, v ≈ c. so, we can approximate v = c.
therefore:
1/3 = e^(-30/(c * 20 * τ))
take natural logarithm:
ln(1/3) = -30/(20cτ)
which simplifies:
-1.0986 ≈ -30/(20cτ)
multiply both sides by -1:
1.0986 ≈ 30/(20cτ)
multiply both sides by 20cτ:
1.0986 * 20cτ = 30
therefore:
20cτ = 30 / 1.0986 ≈ 27.295
so:
cτ ≈ 27.295 / 20 ≈ 1.3647
so, cτ ≈ 1.3647
so this gives us the product cτ. note that τ is the proper lifetime of the particle.
now, the question is asking for the lorentz factor needed to have about two thirds of the particles reach the wall.
so, we need to find γ such that the probability p(t > r/v) = 1 - e^(-r/(vγτ)) ≈ 2/3.
wait, wait. wait, the probability that the particle decays after time r/v is e^(-r/(vγτ)). wait, actually, if the lifetime in the lab frame is t ~ exponential(1/(γτ)), then the probability that t > r/v is e^(-r/(vγτ)). therefore, the survival probability.
therefore, we need e^(-r/(vγτ)) = 2/3.
wait, wait. wait, actually, if the particles decay, the fraction reaching the wall is the probability that their lifetime in the lab frame is longer than the time it takes to cross the distance r. so, that's e^(-r/(vγτ)) = 2/3.
wait, but in the original case, when γ=20, the fraction is 1/3. so, if we set it up as:
fraction reaching wall = e^(-r/(vγτ))
then, when γ=20, e^(-30/(20cτ)) = 1/3.
which is the same equation as before.
so, solving for cτ, as we did earlier, gives cτ ≈ 1.3647
then, for the new lorentz factor γ', we need e^(-30/(γ' * cτ)) = 2/3.
wait, but we need to be careful with the velocity here. since the velocity is given as ultra-relativistic, but dependent on the lorentz factor. the lorentz factor is γ' = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v'^2/c2)).
therefore, v' = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(γ'^2)).
for high γ', this is approximately v' ≈ c (1 - 1/(2γ'^2)) (using a binomial approximation).
however, since we are dealing with velocity in the exponent, perhaps we need to express v in terms of γ.
so, r/(vγτ) = 30/(vγ * 1.3647/c), assuming cτ = 1.3647 as before.
wait, perhaps this is getting too confusing. let me instead express everything in terms of γ.
given that cτ = 1.3647 (from the initial condition with γ=20), then τ = 1.3647 / c.
but we need to relate the distance r to v and τ.
alternatively, let's note that in the lab frame, the lifetime of the particle is γ * τ. the distance it travels is v * γ * τ.
therefore, the condition for the particle to reach the wall is v * γ * τ >= r.
however, since the decay is probabilistic, the fraction that reaches the wall is the survival probability, which for an exponential distribution is e^(-r / (v γ τ)}.
wait, that seems to conflict with our previous equation. wait, why?
wait, the time to reach the wall is t_wall = r / v.
the lifetime in the lab frame is γ τ.
so, the probability that the particle lives longer than t_wall is:
p = e^(- t_wall / (γ τ)) = e^(- r / (v γ τ))
but in our initial setup, when γ=20, this p is 1/3.
so,
1/3 = e^(-30 / (v * 20 * τ))
but we need to express this in terms of c and τ.
since v = c * β, where β is close to 1.
but if we use γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β2), then for high γ, β ≈ 1 - 1/(2 γ2).
so, approximately, β ≈ 1 - 1/(2 γ2), so v ≈ c (1 - 1/(2 γ2))
but perhaps we can relate v and τ through the relation we found earlier.
wait, but we have cτ ≈ 1.3647, so τ ≈ 1.3647 / c.
plugging into the equation:
1/3 = e^(-30 / (v * 20 * τ)) = e^(-30 / (v * 20 * 1.3647 / c)) )
but v is in meters per second, c is meters per second, so let me arrange the terms:
let me rewrite the exponent as:
-30 / (v * 20 * 1.3647 / c) = -30 * c / (v * 20 * 1.3647)
but v = β c, so substituting:
= -30 * c / (β c * 20 * 1.3647) ) = -30 / (β * 20 * 1.3647)
= -30 / (20 * 1.3647 * β ) = -30 / (27.294 * β )
but we can compute 27.294: 20 * 1.3647 = 27.294
so, the exponent is -30 / (27.294 * β )
but when γ=20, β is approximately 1 - 1/(2*202) = 1 - 1/800 ≈ 0.99875.
but let's compute β for γ=20:
γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β2) => sqrt(1 - β2) = 1/γ => 1 - β2 = 1/γ2 => β2 = 1 - 1/γ2 => β = sqrt(1 - 1/400) ≈ sqrt(399/400) ≈ 0.9975.
wait, so β ≈ 0.9975 for γ=20.
therefore, plugging into the exponent:
-30 / (27.294 * 0.9975) ≈ -30 / 27.22 ≈ -1.101
and e^{-1.101} ≈ 1/3, which matches since e^{-1.1} ≈ 0.332, which is close to 1/3.
so that works.
but the problem is that we don't know the exact velocity, but we can relate β to γ through the lorentz factor.
but given that the problem states the lorentz factor is ~20, and in the new case, we need to find a new lorentz factor such that the fraction becomes 2/3.
so, we need to set up the equation for the new γ:
2/3 = e^(-30 / (v' * γ' * τ))
again, using τ = 1.3647 / c, and v' = β' c.
so,
2/3 = e^(-30 / (β' c * γ' * 1.3647 / c)) = e^(-30 / (β' γ' * 1.3647) )
so, exponent is -30 / (1.3647 β' γ') = -30 / (1.3647 * β' γ') ≈ -22.058 / (β' γ')
so, ln(2/3) ≈ -0.4055 = -22.058 / (β' γ')
therefore,
22.058 / (β' γ') ≈ 0.4055 => β' γ' ≈ 22.058 / 0.4055 ≈ 54.4
so, β' γ' ≈ 54.4
but we need to relate β' and γ'.
since γ' = 1 / sqrt(1 - β'^2), we can express β' in terms of γ'.
from γ' = 1 / sqrt(1 - β'^2), we get sqrt(1 - β'^2) = 1/γ'
square both sides: 1 - β'^2 = 1/γ'^2
therefore, β'^2 = 1 - 1/γ'^2
so, β' = sqrt(1 - 1/γ'^2)
thus, β' γ' = sqrt(1 - 1/γ'^2) * γ' = sqrt( γ'^2 (1 - 1/γ'^2) ) = sqrt( γ'^2 - 1 )
therefore, β' γ' = sqrt(γ'^2 - 1)
so, according to the previous result, sqrt(γ'^2 - 1) ≈ 54.4
therefore, solving for γ':
sqrt(γ'^2 - 1) ≈ 54.4
square both sides:
γ'^2 - 1 ≈ 54.42 ≈ 2959.36
therefore, γ'^2 ≈ 2959.36 + 1 ≈ 2960.36
therefore, γ' ≈ sqrt(2960.36) ≈ 54.4
wait, but that gives γ' ≈ 54.4, but the options are a) 40, b) 54, c) 28, d) 68.
so, approximately 54.4, so option b) 54.
wait, but let's check the exact calculation.
wait, earlier steps:
we had for the initial condition:
ln(1/3) ≈ -1.0986 = -30/(20 * c τ * β )
which led to c τ ≈ 3/(2 * 1.0986 * β )
but wait, maybe i approximated β as 1 before? if so, that could be a mistake.
because when we computed cτ ≈1.3647, we didn't take into account β. but in reality, since β is approximately 0.9975 for γ=20, then:
c τ = (30 / (20 * β * 1.0986)) ) wait, let me re-examine that step.
starting again from the first equation:
ln(1/3) = -1.0986 = -30/(v * 20 * τ )
but v = β c, so:
-1.0986 = -30/(β c * 20 * τ )
multiply both sides by -1:
1.0986 = 30/(20 * β c τ )
multiply both sides by 20 * β c τ:
20 * β c τ * 1.0986 = 30
therefore,
β c τ = 30 / (20 * 1.0986 ) ≈ 30 / 21.972 ≈ 1.366
so, c τ β ≈ 1.366
but earlier, when we didn't account for β, we got c τ ≈ 1.366. but now, with β included, this expression is c τ β ≈ 1.366.
but since β is approximately 1 for high γ, this value is still approximately c τ. however, when we need to calculate for a different γ, we have to take into account that β also depends on γ.
wait, this is getting complicated, maybe there's a better way.
wait, the key relation we have is that for the original case (γ=20), we have:
β_1 c τ ≈ 1.366
where β_1 is the velocity factor for γ=20.
for the new γ, we need to find γ' such that the fraction reaching the wall is 2/3.
the equation for the new fraction is:
ln(2/3) ≈ -0.4055 = -30/(v' * γ' * τ )
again, substituting v' = β' c, τ = 1.366/(β c ) from the original condition? wait, maybe not.
wait, if in the original case, β_1 c τ = 1.366, then τ = 1.366 / (β_1 c )
but τ is the proper lifetime, which is a constant. so for different velocities, β changes, but τ is the same. so, actually, we can use τ = 1.366 / (β_1 c )
but since γ is related to β via γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β^2), we can express τ in terms of γ.
wait, perhaps not necessary. let's proceed.
given that β_1 = sqrt(1 - 1/γ_1^2) for γ_1=20, so β_1 ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/400) ≈ 0.9975 as before.
so, β_1 ≈ 0.9975.
thus, τ = 1.366 / (β_1 c ) ≈ 1.366 / (0.9975 c ) ≈ 1.369 / c.
but for the new γ', we have β' = sqrt(1 - 1/γ'^2), and we need to find γ' such that:
ln(2/3) = -30/( β' c γ' τ )
but τ is the same as above, since the proper lifetime doesn't change. so substituting τ:
ln(2/3) = -30/( β' c γ' * (1.366 / (β_1 c )) )
wait, because τ = 1.366 / (β_1 c ) from the first equation. so,
= -30/( β' c γ' * 1.366 / (β_1 c ) )
the c cancels:
= -30/( β' γ' * 1.366 / β_1 )
so,
= -30 * β_1 / (1.366 β' γ' )
thus,
-0.4055 ≈ -30 * 0.9975 / (1.366 β' γ' )
simplify the right-hand side:
30 * 0.9975 ≈ 29.925
1.366 * β' γ' * 0.4055 ≈ 29.925
wait, wait. wait, let me re-examine the equation:
ln(2/3) ≈ -0.4055 ≈ -30 * β_1 / (1.366 β' γ' )
thus, removing the negative sign:
0.4055 ≈ 30 * 0.9975 / (1.366 β' γ' )
multiply both sides by the denominator:
0.4055 * 1.366 β' γ' ≈ 30 * 0.9975
calculate 30 * 0.9975 ≈ 29.925
calculate 0.4055 * 1.366 ≈ 0.553
thus:
0.553 β' γ' ≈ 29.925
therefore, β' γ' ≈ 29.925 / 0.553 ≈ 54.1
which is the same as before.
but we also know that β' γ' = sqrt(γ'^2 - 1 )
therefore, sqrt(γ'^2 -1 ) ≈ 54.1
thus, squaring both sides:
γ'^2 - 1 ≈ 54.1^2 ≈ 2926
therefore, γ'^2 ≈ 2927
thus, γ' ≈ sqrt(2927 ) ≈ 54.1
wait, but 54.1 squared is 54.1 * 54.1. 54^2=2916, 54.1^2= (54 + 0.1)^2= 54^2 + 2*54*0.1 +0.1^2=2916 +10.8 +0.01=2926.81
therefore, sqrt(2927) ≈ 54.099, which is approximately 54.1.
therefore, the required γ' is approximately 54.1.
looking at the options, b) 54, c) 28, d) 68.
so the closest answer is 54, option b.
but wait, let me check again.
wait, but in the calculation above, we arrived at γ' ≈ 54.1, which is very close to option b) 54.
therefore, the answer should be b) 54.
wait, but maybe we can do a sanity check.
if the required lorentz factor is about 54, that's more than double the original γ of 20.
but why? because in the equation we had to get βγ to be about 54, and since sqrt(γ^2 -1 ) ≈ βγ, then γ is approximately 54.
alternatively, perhaps there is an error in the assumption that the survival probability is e^(-r/(vγτ)). but according to the exponential distribution for relativistic particles, this seems correct.
alternatively, another approach could be considering the relation between the lorentz factor and the fraction.
since the fraction reaching the wall is e^(-r/(vγτ)), and taking into account that τ is related to the original condition, we can set up a ratio.
let’s denote for the first case (γ=20, fraction=1/3):
1/3 = e^(-30/(c * γ1 * τ))
for the second case (γ=γ2, fraction=2/3):
2/3 = e^(-30/(c * γ2 * τ))
taking the ratio or combining the equations.
let me take the natural log of both equations:
for the first case:
ln(1/3) = -30/(c γ1 τ )
for the second case:
ln(2/3) = -30/(c γ2 τ )
thus, dividing the two equations:
ln(1/3) / ln(2/3) = (-30/(c γ1 τ )) / (-30/(c γ2 τ )) )
simplifies to:
ln(1/3) / ln(2/3) = γ2 / γ1
calculate ln(1/3) ≈ -1.0986
ln(2/3) ≈ -0.4055
therefore, (-1.0986)/(-0.4055) ≈ 2.71
thus, 2.71 ≈ γ2 / γ1
therefore, γ2 ≈ 2.71 * γ1 ≈ 2.71 * 20 ≈ 54.2
which is very close to the previous result, approximately 54.2, so 54.
therefore, the answer is b) 54.
therefore, boxed answer is \boxed{b}
</think>

answer: given that particles produced in a spherical detector with a radius of 30 meters have a lorentz factor of ~20, and one third of these particles reach the detector walls, we need to determine the lorentz factor required for two thirds of the particles to reach the walls.

1. **understanding lorentz factor and relativistic lifetime**: the lorentz factor (\(\gamma\)) relates to the lifetime dilation of fast-decaying particles. a higher \(\gamma\) means a longer lifetime in the lab frame, allowing particles to travel farther before decaying.

2. **exponential decay probability**: the probability of a particle decaying after traveling a distance \(x\) is given by \(e^{-x / (v \gamma \tau)}\), where \(v\) is the particle's velocity, \(\gamma\) is the lorentz factor, and \(\tau\) is the proper lifetime.

3. **given condition**: for \(\gamma = 20\), the fraction of particles reaching the wall (30 meters) is \(1/3\). this gives the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} = e^{-30 / (v \cdot 20 \cdot \tau)}
   \]
   taking natural logarithms:
   \[
   \ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{30}{v \cdot 20 \cdot \tau}
   \]
   simplifying, we find \(c \tau \approx 1.366\).

4. **new condition**: for the fraction to be \(2/3\):
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} = e^{-30 / (v' \cdot \gamma' \cdot \tau)}
   \]
   taking natural logarithms:
   \[
   \ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{30}{v' \cdot \gamma' \cdot \tau}
   \]

5. **relating velocities and lorentz factors**: using the relationship \(v = c \sqrt{1 - 1/\gamma^2}\) and approximating for high \(\gamma\), we find:
   \[
   \beta \gamma = \sqrt{\gamma^2 - 1}
   \]

6. **solving for \(\gamma'\)**:
   - from the given condition: \(\sqrt{20^2 - 1} \approx 19.97\)
   - from the new condition: \(\sqrt{\gamma'^2 - 1} \approx 54.1\)
   - solving \(\gamma'^2 - 1 \approx 54.1^2\), we find \(\gamma' \approx 54.1\).

thus, the required lorentz factor is approximately 54, leading to the answer:

\boxed{b}
