Okay, let's see. So, the problem is about three exoplanets with circular orbits. We need to find the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1. The given information includes ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and mass ratios. All planets have an albedo of 0.3. Let me start by recalling some relevant formulas.
First, the equilibrium temperature of a planet is related to its distance from the star, right? The formula for equilibrium temperature is usually something like T = T_star * (R_star / (2a))^(1/2) * (1 - albedo)^(-1/4). Wait, but since all the planets are around the same star, and the albedo is the same for all of them, maybe we can simplify this. Let me check.
The equilibrium temperature equation, considering albedo, is: T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2a)) * (1 - albedo)^(-1/4). Since all planets are around the same star, T_star and R_star are the same for all. The albedo is also the same (0.3). Therefore, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between two planets should be inversely proportional to the square root of their semi-major axes (since a is the distance from the star). So, T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1), because T proportional to 1/sqrt(a).
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: Determination of the ratio of semi-major axes (a1/a2) from the given temperature ratio (T1/T2 = 1.4).
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: Determination of the ratio of semi-major axes (a2/a3) from the given temperature ratio (T2/T3 = 2.3).
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The ratio of equilibrium temperatures for Planet1 and Planet2 is given as T1/T2 ≈ 1.4. Based on the relationship T ∝ 1/√a, this temperature ratio T1/T2 is equal to √(a2/a1). Squaring both sides of the equation T1/T2 = √(a2/a1) yields (T1/T2)² = a2/a1. Substituting the given temperature ratio of 1.4, the calculation (1.4)² = 1.96 determines that a2/a1 = 1.96.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The temperature ratio between Planet2 (T2) and Planet3 (T3) is 2.3. Using the relationship T2/T3 = sqrt(a3/a2), the ratio a3/a2 is found to be (T2/T3)^2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The semi-major axis ratio a1/a2 was determined to be approximately 0.509 (from a2/a1 = 1.96), and the ratio a2/a3 was determined to be approximately 0.189 (from a3/a2 = 5.29).
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Therefore, the semi-major axis ratios are: a2/a1 = 1.96, and a3/a2 = 5.29. So, the ratio a3/a1 would be (a3/a2)*(a2/a1) = 5.29 * 1.96. Let me compute that. 5.29 * 2 = 10.58, subtract 5.29*0.04=0.2116, so 5.29*1.96 = 10.58 - 0.2116 = 10.3684. Approximately 10.37. So, a3/a1 ≈10.37.
Now, orbital periods are related to semi-major axes through Kepler's third law, right? Which states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. So, (P3/P1)^2 = (a3/a1)^(3/2). Therefore, P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/4).
Let's think in parallel.

</Path>
<Path>
2: The ratio of orbital periods (P3/P1) is determined by raising the semi-major axis ratio (a3/a1) to the power of 3/4. Using the approximation a3/a1 ≈ 10.3684, the calculation (10.3684)^(3/4) is equivalent to [(10.3684)^(1/4)]^3. The fourth root of 10.3684 is approximately 1.78 (since 1.78^4 ≈ 10.36), which when cubed (1.78^3 ≈ 5.67) yields an initial estimate for P3/P1. This estimate is refined by using a more precise value for the fourth root. The fourth root of 10.3684 is approximately 1.781, as 1.781^4 ≈ (3.173) * (3.173) ≈ 10.07, which is slightly less than 10.3684. A more accurate approximation for the fourth root of 10.3684 is 1.784, since 1.784^4 ≈ (3.185) * (3.185) ≈ 10.147, which is still less than 10.3684. The value 1.786^4 is approximately (3.190) * (3.190) ≈ 10.176. The value 1.79^4 is approximately (3.2041) * (3.2041) ≈ 10.26. The value 1.80^4 is (10.4976), which is greater than 10.3684. The value 1.795^4 is approximately (3.233) * (3.233) ≈ 10.45. A linear approximation is used to find the fourth root of 10.3684. The difference between 10.4976 and 10.26 is 0.2376, and the difference between 10.3684 and 10.26 is 0.1084. The scaling factor is 0.1084 / 0.2376 ≈ 0.456. The difference between 1.80 and 1.79 is 0.01. The approximate fourth root is 1.79 + 0.01 * 0.456 ≈ 1.79456. Therefore, the fourth root of 10.3684 is approximately 1.795. The orbital period ratio (P3/P1) is calculated as (1.795)^3 ≈ 6.01. The cube of 1.795 is computed as 1.795 * 1.795 = 3.22, then 3.22 * 1.795 ≈ 5.78, which is close to the previous estimate. A more accurate calculation uses the approximation (a3/a1) = 10.37. The natural logarithm of 10.37 is approximately 2.34. The expression (3/4) * ln(10.37) ≈ (0.75) * 2.34 ≈ 1.755. The exponential of 1.755 is approximately e^1.755 ≈ 5.77, which is close to the previous estimates. The logarithmic method confirms an approximate orbital period ratio of 5.77. A direct calculation using a3/a1 = 10.37 is performed. The value 10.37^(3/4) is equivalent to (10.37^(1/4))^3. The fourth root of 10 is approximately 1.778, and the fourth root of 10.37 is slightly larger. The value 1.78^4 is approximately 10.36, which is close to 10.37. Therefore, 10.37^(1/4) is approximately 1.78, and (1.78)^3 is approximately 5.67. The value 10.37^(3/4) is approximately 5.67. The previous estimate of 5.67 is compared to the logarithmic estimate of 5.77, indicating a small discrepancy. The value 10.37^(3/4) is approximately 5.7.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The ratio of semi-major axes (a3/a1) was determined to be approximately 10.37. The ratio of orbital periods (P3/P1) was determined to be approximately 5.7, based on calculations involving direct exponentiation and logarithmic methods.

Wait, but the options given are A) ~3.2, B) ~10.4, C) ~33.4, D) ~4.4. Hmm, 5.7 is not listed exactly. Wait, let me check the problem again. Maybe I missed something? Wait, the question is: By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1. So, if the answer is around 5.7, but the options are 3.2, 10.4, 33.4, 4.4. Hmmm. None of these options is close to 5.7. So, I must have made a mistake.
Wait, let me check my steps again.
First, the equilibrium temperature ratios: T1/T2 = 1.4, which implies sqrt(a2/a1) = 1.4. Therefore, a2/a1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. Correct.
Then, T2/T3 = 2.3, which implies sqrt(a3/a2) = 2.3. Therefore, a3/a2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29. Correct. Therefore, a3/a1 = 1.96 * 5.29 = 10.3684. Correct.
Then, Kepler's third law: (P3/P1)^2 = (a3/a1)^3. Therefore, (P3/P1) = (a3/a1)^(3/2). Wait, wait. Wait, Kepler's third law is P^2 proportional to a^3. Therefore, P3/P1 = sqrt( (a3^3)/(a1^3) )^(1/2) ) which is (a3/a1)^(3/2). Wait, no, wait: if P^2 ∝ a^3, then P ∝ a^(3/2). Therefore, the ratio P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2). Wait, so previously, I used (a3/a1)^(3/4), which is incorrect. That was a mistake.
Let me correct that. If T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1), then yes, that's correct because T ∝ 1/sqrt(a). Therefore, Temperature ratio is sqrt(a2/a1) for T1/T2, leading to a2/a1 = (T1/T2)^2. Correct.
Then, the a3/a1 is product of a2/a1 and a3/a2. Correct.
Then, Kepler's third law: orbital period ratio is (a3/a1)^(3/2). So, P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2). So, if a3/a1 ≈10.37, then (P3/P1)= (10.37)^(3/2).
Compute (10.37)^(3/2). First, sqrt(10.37)≈3.22. Then, 3.22^3 = 3.22*3.22=10.3684, then 10.3684*3.22 ≈33.38. So, approximately 33.38. So, the answer is approximately 33.4, which is option C.
Wait, so that's a big difference. I must have confused the exponent in Kepler's third law. It's P ∝ a^(3/2), so the ratio is (a3/a1)^(3/2), not 3/4. That was a critical mistake. Therefore, the correct answer is C) ~33.4.
Wait, but let me confirm once again. The steps are:
1. From equilibrium temperature ratios, find the semi-major axis ratios. Correct, leading to a3/a1 ≈10.37.
2. Then, orbital period ratio is (a3/a1)^(3/2). So, (10.37)^(3/2) = sqrt(10.37^3). Which is the same as (sqrt(10.37))^3. As computed above, sqrt(10.37)≈3.22, and 3.22 cubed is about 3.22*3.22=10.3684, then 10.3684*3.22≈33.38. So, yes, approximately 33.4. That's answer C.
Wait, but why did I previously think it was (a3/a1)^(3/4)? Because maybe I confused the period with something else. If T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a), and maybe thought Kepler's third law was P^2 ∝ a^3, so P ∝ a^(3/2), but no. Wait, no, if P^2 is proportional to a^3, then P is proportional to a^(3/2). So yes, that's correct. So, the period ratio is (a3/a1)^(3/2). Therefore, 10.37^(3/2)=33.4. So, answer C.
Therefore, despite the information about mass ratios being given in the problem, they are irrelevant for calculating the orbital period ratio, since Kepler's third law relates period to semi-major axis, independent of mass (for circular orbits, as given). The mass ratios might be red herrings here. Similarly, the albedo is given as 0.3 for all, so it cancels out in the temperature ratio equations. So, all makes sense.
Therefore, the answer is C) ~33.4.
**Final Answer**
The factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 is \boxed{C}.
</Think>

Answer: Given the problem of determining the orbital period ratio of Planet3 to Planet1, we start by analyzing the given equilibrium temperature ratios and mass ratios. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Equilibrium Temperature Ratios**:
   - The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4. Using the relationship \( T_1 / T_2 = \sqrt{a_2 / a_1} \), we find:
     \[
     \left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^2 = \frac{a_2}{a_1} \implies \frac{a_2}{a_1} = (1.4)^2 = 1.96
     \]
   - The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3. Similarly:
     \[
     \left( \frac{T_2}{T_3} \right)^2 = \frac{a_3}{a_2} \implies \frac{a_3}{a_2} = (2.3)^2 = 5.29
     \]

2. **Semi-Major Axis Ratios**:
   - Combining the semi-major axis ratios:
     \[
     \frac{a_3}{a_1} = \frac{a_3}{a_2} \times \frac{a_2}{a_1} = 5.29 \times 1.96 \approx 10.37
     \]

3. **Kepler's Third Law**:
   - The orbital period ratio is given by \( (a_3 / a_1)^{3/2} \):
     \[
     \frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left( \frac{a_3}{a_1} \right)^{3/2} = (10.37)^{3/2}
     \]
   - Calculating this value:
     \[
     \sqrt{10.37} \approx 3.22, \quad (3.22)^3 \approx 33.4
     \]

Thus, the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 is \(\boxed{C}\).

1: the ratio of equilibrium temperatures for planet1 and planet2 is given as t1/t2 ≈ 1.4. based on the relationship t ∝ 1/√a, this temperature ratio t1/t2 is equal to √(a2/a1). squaring both sides of the equation t1/t2 = √(a2/a1) yields (t1/t2)² = a2/a1. substituting the given temperature ratio of 1.4, the calculation (1.4)² = 1.96 determines that a2/a1 = 1.96.

2: the temperature ratio between planet2 (t2) and planet3 (t3) is 2.3. using the relationship t2/t3 = sqrt(a3/a2), the ratio a3/a2 is found to be (t2/t3)^2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29.

the semi-major axis ratio a1/a2 was determined to be approximately 0.509 (from a2/a1 = 1.96), and the ratio a2/a3 was determined to be approximately 0.189 (from a3/a2 = 5.29).

therefore, the semi-major axis ratios are: a2/a1 = 1.96, and a3/a2 = 5.29. so, the ratio a3/a1 would be (a3/a2)*(a2/a1) = 5.29 * 1.96. let me compute that. 5.29 * 2 = 10.58, subtract 5.29*0.04=0.2116, so 5.29*1.96 = 10.58 - 0.2116 = 10.3684. approximately 10.37. so, a3/a1 ≈10.37.
now, orbital periods are related to semi-major axes through kepler's third law, right? which states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. so, (p3/p1)^2 = (a3/a1)^(3/2). therefore, p3/p1 = (a3/a1)^(3/4).

wait, let me check my steps again.
first, the equilibrium temperature ratios: t1/t2 = 1.4, which implies sqrt(a2/a1) = 1.4. therefore, a2/a1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. correct.
then, t2/t3 = 2.3, which implies sqrt(a3/a2) = 2.3. therefore, a3/a2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29. correct. therefore, a3/a1 = 1.96 * 5.29 = 10.3684. correct.
then, kepler's third law: (p3/p1)^2 = (a3/a1)^3. therefore, (p3/p1) = (a3/a1)^(3/2). wait, wait. wait, kepler's third law is p^2 proportional to a^3. therefore, p3/p1 = sqrt( (a3^3)/(a1^3) )^(1/2) ) which is (a3/a1)^(3/2). wait, no, wait: if p^2 ∝ a^3, then p ∝ a^(3/2). therefore, the ratio p3/p1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2). wait, so previously, i used (a3/a1)^(3/4), which is incorrect. that was a mistake.
let me correct that. if t1/t2 = sqrt(a2/a1), then yes, that's correct because t ∝ 1/sqrt(a). therefore, temperature ratio is sqrt(a2/a1) for t1/t2, leading to a2/a1 = (t1/t2)^2. correct.
then, the a3/a1 is product of a2/a1 and a3/a2. correct.
then, kepler's third law: orbital period ratio is (a3/a1)^(3/2). so, p3/p1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2). so, if a3/a1 ≈10.37, then (p3/p1)= (10.37)^(3/2).
compute (10.37)^(3/2). first, sqrt(10.37)≈3.22. then, 3.22^3 = 3.22*3.22=10.3684, then 10.3684*3.22 ≈33.38. so, approximately 33.38. so, the answer is approximately 33.4, which is option c.
wait, so that's a big difference. i must have confused the exponent in kepler's third law. it's p ∝ a^(3/2), so the ratio is (a3/a1)^(3/2), not 3/4. that was a critical mistake. therefore, the correct answer is c) ~33.4.
wait, but let me confirm once again. the steps are:
1. from equilibrium temperature ratios, find the semi-major axis ratios. correct, leading to a3/a1 ≈10.37.
2. then, orbital period ratio is (a3/a1)^(3/2). so, (10.37)^(3/2) = sqrt(10.37^3). which is the same as (sqrt(10.37))^3. as computed above, sqrt(10.37)≈3.22, and 3.22 cubed is about 3.22*3.22=10.3684, then 10.3684*3.22≈33.38. so, yes, approximately 33.4. that's answer c.
wait, but why did i previously think it was (a3/a1)^(3/4)? because maybe i confused the period with something else. if t is proportional to 1/sqrt(a), and maybe thought kepler's third law was p^2 ∝ a^3, so p ∝ a^(3/2), but no. wait, no, if p^2 is proportional to a^3, then p is proportional to a^(3/2). so yes, that's correct. so, the period ratio is (a3/a1)^(3/2). therefore, 10.37^(3/2)=33.4. so, answer c.
therefore, despite the information about mass ratios being given in the problem, they are irrelevant for calculating the orbital period ratio, since kepler's third law relates period to semi-major axis, independent of mass (for circular orbits, as given). the mass ratios might be red herrings here. similarly, the albedo is given as 0.3 for all, so it cancels out in the temperature ratio equations. so, all makes sense.
therefore, the answer is c) ~33.4.

answer: given the problem of determining the orbital period ratio of planet3 to planet1, we start by analyzing the given equilibrium temperature ratios and mass ratios. the key steps are as follows:

1. **equilibrium temperature ratios**:
   - the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between planet1 and planet2 is 1.4. using the relationship \( t_1 / t_2 = \sqrt{a_2 / a_1} \), we find:
     \[
     \left( \frac{t_1}{t_2} \right)^2 = \frac{a_2}{a_1} \implies \frac{a_2}{a_1} = (1.4)^2 = 1.96
     \]
   - the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between planet2 and planet3 is 2.3. similarly:
     \[
     \left( \frac{t_2}{t_3} \right)^2 = \frac{a_3}{a_2} \implies \frac{a_3}{a_2} = (2.3)^2 = 5.29
     \]

2. **semi-major axis ratios**:
   - combining the semi-major axis ratios:
     \[
     \frac{a_3}{a_1} = \frac{a_3}{a_2} \times \frac{a_2}{a_1} = 5.29 \times 1.96 \approx 10.37
     \]

3. **kepler's third law**:
   - the orbital period ratio is given by \( (a_3 / a_1)^{3/2} \):
     \[
     \frac{p_3}{p_1} = \left( \frac{a_3}{a_1} \right)^{3/2} = (10.37)^{3/2}
     \]
   - calculating this value:
     \[
     \sqrt{10.37} \approx 3.22, \quad (3.22)^3 \approx 33.4
     \]

thus, the factor by which the orbital period of planet3 is larger than that of planet1 is \(\boxed{c}\)
