Okay, so I need to figure out which of the given organic compounds show optical isomerism.
The options are 1, 2, 3, and 4, and then the answer choices combine these numbers.
Let me recall what optical isomerism is.
Optical isomers are a type of stereoisomerism where the molecules are mirror images of each other and are not superimposable.
This usually occurs when there is a chiral center in the molecule, which is an atom (usually carbon) that is bonded to four different groups.
So, first, I need to analyze each compound to see if they have chiral centers or any other features that lead to optical isomerism.
Let's take each one by one.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: Determine optical isomerism for Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

1: Compound 1 is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.
The compound is a biphenyl derivative with nitro groups at positions 6 and 6', and carboxylate groups at positions 2 and 2'.
The carboxylate groups are esterified with methyl groups.
The biphenyl core consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond.
The positions of substitution are 2, 2', 6, and 6'.
The biphenyl structure itself can exhibit certain types of isomerism, such as E/Z isomerism if substituents are arranged appropriately.
However, the question concerns optical isomerism, which arises from chiral centers.
Chiral centers in biphenyl derivatives typically require a central atom attached to four different groups.
Biphenyl systems, particularly those substituted at the 1 and 1' positions, can sometimes possess a plane of symmetry.
This specific compound is substituted on each benzene ring at the 2 and 6 positions.
The 2,2'-dicarboxylate groups are located ortho to the connecting bond, while the 6,6'-dinitro groups are located para to the connecting bond.
The structure can be visualized as the two benzene rings linked at positions 1 and 1'.
On each ring, the substituents are at positions 2 (carboxylate) and 6 (nitro).
The 2 position is adjacent to the connecting bond, and the 6 position is meta to the connecting bond.
The presence of two identical substituents (nitro groups at 6 and 6') and two identical ester groups (dimethyl dicarboxylate at 2 and 2') suggests that the compound might have a plane of symmetry.
This symmetry implies that the molecule is not chiral.
A molecule with a plane of symmetry cannot be optically active.
Therefore, Compound 1 does not exhibit optical isomerism.

2: Compound 2 is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
2.1: Identify the structure of Compound 2.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2.2: Determine if Compound 2 has a chiral center.

2.1: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of lactic acid.
Its structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COO-CH3.
</Path>
<Path>
2.2: The carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to a hydroxyl group (OH), a hydrogen atom (H), a methyl group (CH3), and a carbon chain (from the adjacent carbon, likely part of a larger structure).
</Path>
<Conclusion>
Compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) has a structure CH3-CH(OH)-COO-CH3, and the carbon at position 2 is connected to four different groups.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
This configuration forms a chiral center at the C2 carbon, indicating the possibility of optical isomers.
The presence of a chiral center confirms that Compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism.
</Path>
<Path>
3: Compound 3 is benzophenone, the structure of which is a benzene ring attached to a ketone (C=O) group. The molecular formula for benzophenone is C13H10O. In this structure, the central carbon of the ketone is bonded to two phenyl groups. The carbon atom in the ketone group is bonded to two phenyl groups and two oxygen atoms. This configuration results in the carbon being bonded to four substituents: two phenyl groups and two oxygen atoms (one from the carbonyl group, C=O, and one from any possible single bond). This arrangement satisfies the condition of four different groups attached to a single carbon atom, making this carbon a chiral center. The presence of a chiral center implies the possibility of optical isomers. Benzophenone, however, is a planar molecule. The two phenyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon are in the same plane due to the rigidity introduced by the adjacent benzene rings. This planar structure prevents the molecule from existing in two different spatial arrangements. The molecule cannot rotate freely about the C=O bond due to the bulky benzene rings. The inability to rotate leads to the molecule being locked in a single plane, preventing the formation of enantiomers. Consequently, benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism despite having a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. The reason for this exception is the molecule's planarity, which arises from the rigid benzene rings. Benzophenone thus does not possess optical isomers.

4: Compound 4 is dimethyl fumarate.
Let's think in parallel.

4.1: Fumarate is the E-configuration of butenedioic acid.
The dimethyl ester would have two methyl ester groups substituting for two hydroxyl groups.
The molecular structure of dimethyl fumarate involves a conjugated diene structure.
The double bonds in fumarate are conjugated, but the molecule itself is symmetrical.
The structure is R-OOC-CH2-CH2-COOR, where R is the methyl group.
The central CH2 group is identical on both sides.
The central carbon atom in the chain is bonded to two CH2 groups, an ester group, and another ester group.
This symmetry suggests that the central carbon is not a chiral center.
The central carbon is therefore not a chiral center.
The molecule is symmetrical, with no chiral centers.
</Path>
<Path>
4.2: Fumarate is the E-isomer of butenedioic acid, and dimethyl fumarate is the E-diester.
Geometric isomerism, specifically E/Z isomerism, occurs in alkenes with different substituents on each carbon.
The E configuration indicates opposite substituents.
Fumarate, as an E-isomer, is geometrically distinct from the Z-isomer (maleate).
However, the question concerns optical isomerism.

<Path>
4.3: Dimethyl fumarate exhibits geometric isomerism, not optical isomerism.

<Conclusion>
Dimethyl fumarate lacks a chiral center and possesses geometric isomerism (E configuration). It does not exhibit optical isomerism.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
</Path>
<Conclusion>
Compound 1 (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate) does not show optical isomerism due to its planar structure. Compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) shows optical isomerism because it possesses a chiral center. Compound 3 (benzophenone) does not show optical isomerism despite having a chiral carbon due to its planar structure. Compound 4 (dimethyl fumarate) exhibits geometric isomerism but not optical isomerism.

3: Compound 3, benzophenone, possesses a central carbon atom attached to two phenyl groups and a carbonyl group, which creates a chiral center. However, the molecule's planar structure, due to the rigidity of the benzene rings, prevents it from existing in different spatial arrangements. This lack of non-superimposable mirror images means that benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism.

So among the options, only 2 shows optical isomerism.
Let's check the answer choices:
A) 1 and 2 - but 1 doesn't have.
B) 1, 2 and 4 - nope, 1 and 4 don't.
C) 3 and 4 - neither 3 nor 4 have.
D) 2 and 3 - but 3 doesn't.
Wait, but according to my analysis, only compound 2 has optical isomers.
But none of the answer choices is just 2.
Hmm. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.
Let me check again.
Wait, maybe fumarate (compound 4) can have optical isomers?
Wait, fumarate is E-malate diester.
Since fumarate is a geometric isomer (E vs Z), but enantiomers would be different if there's a chiral center.
Wait, in the case of dimethyl fumarate, the molecule is E-configured, but is fumarate also capable of having optical activity?
Wait, fumaric acid (E-isomer) is actually meso when considering potential chiral centers.
Wait, wait.
Let me think.
Fumaric acid is E-ethenedioic acid.
The structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH.
Wait, no, no.
No, wait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with E-configuration.
The double bond is between C2 and C3.
Each carbon in the double bond is connected to a COOH group and a CH2 group.
Wait, but each carbon in the double bond is part of the conjugated system.
Since it's a double bond, those carbons are sp2 hybridized.
So, they have trigonal planar geometry.
Therefore, no possibility of optical isomerism here.
Optical isomerism requires a chiral center, not just a double bond.
So, even though fumarate has geometric isomerism (E vs Z), it does not have optical isomerism.
Unless, if the molecule has a chiral center.
Wait, but in dimethyl fumarate, the ester groups would be on the COOH ends.
So, the central part is still the conjugated double bond.
So, no, the chirality isn't introduced here.
So, compound 4 is incorrect.
Therefore, only compound 2 is correct.
But the answer options don't have just 2.
Hmm.
Wait, maybe I made a mistake with benzophenone?
Wait, benzophenone's structure is (C6H5)2CO.
The central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and a carbonyl group.
So, the carbon in the carbonyl is part of a C=O double bond.
So, that carbon is bonded to O (double bond), and two phenyl groups.
Wait, but in that case, the carbon in the carbonyl group is connected to three substituents: O and two phenyls?
Wait, no.
The structure is Ph2CO.
So, the central carbon is connected via double bond to O and has two phenyl groups.
So, actually, the central carbon is bonded to O (double bond) and two phenyl groups.
That would be only three substituents.
But carbon has four bonds.
Wait, right, the other bond is a single bond.
Wait, perhaps there's a mistake here.
Benzophenone is (C6H5)2CO.
So, structure is:
Ph-C(=O)- ?
No, no.
Wait, benzophenone is diphenyl ketone.
So, the ketone structure is:
Ph-CO-Ph
Which is Ph2C=O.
So, the central carbon is bonded via double bond to oxygen and via two single bonds to phenyl groups.
So, the central carbon in the ketone has three substituents: two phenyl groups and one double bond to oxygen.
But since it's a carbonyl group, that's a double bond.
So, actually, the central carbon is only bonded to three groups: two phenyls and one oxygen (as a double bond).
Then, the fourth bond is a lone pair?
No, carbons don't have lone pairs.
Wait, no.
All bonds are taken.
For a ketone group, the carbonyl carbon is bonded to O (double bond) and two substituted groups (here, phenyl).
So, that's two single bonds to phenyl and a double bond to oxygen.
So, total of four bonds.
So, that carbon is bonded to O and two phenyl groups.
So, if both phenyl groups are the same, then that carbon isn't a chiral center because the two phenyl groups are the same.
So, in that case, the central carbon is symmetrical.
So, in benzophenone, since both substituents on the carbonyl carbon are phenyl (same group), then that carbon is not a chiral center.
Therefore, benzophenone is not a chiral molecule.
Therefore, no optical isomerism.
So, I was correct before.
Therefore, compound 3 is not a chiral molecule.
So, only compound 2 is.
Therefore, the answer should be the option that includes only 2.
But looking at the options, there's no option with only 2.
Hmm.
Wait, perhaps methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is not a chiral molecule?
Let's re-examine compound 2.
Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.
Let's draw the structure.
The carboxylic acid is converted to an ester, so the structure is CH2(COOCH3)CH2OH.
Wait, no.
Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate is lactic acid.
So, methyl lactate would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3?
Wait, no.
Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-.
So, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2CH2COO-.
Then, methyl ester would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3.
But wait, the correct structure of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (lactic acid) is HOCH2CH(COOH).
No, wait.
Let's get the structure right.
Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH.
2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl group on the second carbon: HO-CH2-CH(COOH)-.
Wait, no.
For propanoic acid, the chain is CH3CH2COOH.
The positions are:
1: CH3-
2: CH2-
3: COOH
Wait, no.
Actually, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH.
So, the carbons are 1 (CH3), 2 (CH2), 3 (COOH).
So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl group on the middle carbon: CH3-CHOH-COOH.
Then, converting the COOH to a COOCH3 ester group, we get CH3-CHOH-COOCH3.
So, the structure has a chirality center at the middle carbon (C2) because it is attached to -CH3, -OH, -COOCH3, and a hydrogen (if any?) Wait, no.
Wait, in 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COO- ?
Wait, I'm getting confused here.
Let's think again.
The correct structure of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is indeed lactic acid: CH3-CHOH-COOH.
So, when we make the methyl ester, we get CH3-CHOH-COOCH3 (methyl lactate).
The carbon atom at position 2 (the C connected to OH) is connected to:
- CH3 (from the neighboring carbon)
- OH
- COOCH3 (attached to the same carbon)
- and a hydrogen?
Wait, the C2 in lactic acid is already connected to OH, COOH (which becomes COOCH3), and two CH3 groups?
Wait, maybe not.
Let me number the carbons properly.
In lactic acid: The -CH3 is C1.
The -CHOH is C2.
The -COOH is C3.
So, C2 is CH(OH)-.
Then, when forming the methyl ester, the COOH becomes COOCH3.
But the structure is still:
C1: -CH3
C2: -CHOH-
C3: -COOCH3
But C2 is connected to what?
C1 (which is CH3), C3 (which is COOCH3), OH, and a hydrogen?
Wait, no.
If C2 is CH(OH), then the structure is:
C1-C2-C3
where C1 is CH3, C2 is CH(OH), and C3 is COOCH3.
But C2 has to have four bonds.
So, C2 would be connected to:
- one bond to C1 (which is CH3)
- one bond to C3 (which is COOCH3)
- one bond to OH
- and one bond to a hydrogen.
So, C2 is CH(OH)(H) connected to C1 and C3.
Wait, but that would make C2 as -CH(OH)-, with substituents: one CH3 (from C1), one COOCH3 (from C3), OH, and H.
Therefore, C2 is connected to four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H.
Therefore, C2 is a chiral center.
Therefore, even in the methyl ester (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate), the C2 carbon is still attached to four different groups, making it a chiral center.
Therefore, compound 2 does indeed have optical isomers.
So, the answer should include 2.
So, which answer choices include 2?
A) 1 and 2 - but 1 is incorrect.
B) 1, 2 and 4 - but 1 and 4 are incorrect.
C) 3 and 4 - incorrect.
D) 2 and 3 - but 3 is incorrect.
Wait, so there's a mistake in the answer choices?
Because according to my analysis, only 2 is correct.
But none of the options is just 2.
Hmm.
Wait, maybe I made a mistake with compound 1?
Let me check again.
Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.
So, this is a biphenyl molecule where each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate group at position 2.
Both carboxylates are esterified with methyl groups.
The biphenyl is connected at positions 1 and 1'.
The substitution is at 2, 2', 6, and 6'.
So, each ring has a nitro group in the para position relative to the connecting bond (position 6 is four positions away from 1 and 1'), but the rings are connected at 1,1'.
Wait, in biphenyl systems, the numbering would go such that the two connected carbons are positions 1 and 1'.
Then, substituents on each ring are numbered accordingly.
So, in this case, each ring has a nitro group at position 6 (which is the para position relative to the connecting bond) and a carboxylate group at position 2.
So, the structure would be symmetric.
If the molecule is symmetric, then there won't be any chiral centers.
For example, if substituents are placed at positions 2 and 6 on both rings, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, thus making it achiral.
However, if the substitution leads to a lack of symmetry, it could be chiral.
But in this case, 6,6'-dinitro and 2,2'-dicarboxylate suggests that the substituents are mirror-symmetrical.
So, each ring has a nitro group at the para position of the connecting ring and a carboxylate at the ortho position.
Therefore, the entire molecule would have a plane of symmetry between the two rings.
Hence, it is achiral and does not have optical isomers.
Therefore, compound 1 is incorrect.
So, only compound 2 is correct.
But the answer choices don't have an option with only 2.
Hmm.
Then, perhaps the answer intended is D) 2 and 3, but 3 is incorrect.
Wait, but maybe I made a mistake with benzophenone (compound 3).
Let's check again.
Benzophenone is (C6H5)2CO.
The structure is two phenyl groups attached to a carbonyl group.
The central carbon in the carbonyl is connected to two phenyl groups and a double-bonded oxygen.
Since both substituents on the carbonyl carbon are the same (both phenyl groups), this carbon is not a chiral center.
Additionally, because the molecule is symmetrical, there are no chiral centers.
Therefore, benzophenone is achiral and does not have optical isomers.
So, compound 3 is incorrect.
Therefore, the answer options don't include the correct answer if only 2 is correct.
But perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem?
Or maybe I made a mistake?
Alternatively, maybe compound 4, dimethyl fumarate, can have optical isomerism.
Let me check again.
Fumarate is the E-isomer of butenedioic acid.
The structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH (but that's succinate).
No, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, E-configured.
So, dimethyl fumarate would be the diester: CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2-COOCH3?
No, wait, fumarate is the acid, so replacing the two COOH groups with COOCH3.
So, dimethyl fumarate would be CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3.
Wait, but fumarate's double bond is between C2 and C3.
So, the molecule would be HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH (succinate) vs. HOOC-CH=CH-COOH (fumarate).
So, dimethyl fumarate would be (CH3COO)-CH2-CH2-CH2-(COOCH3).
No, wait, no.
Wait, fumarate is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid.
The structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH.
When esterified with methyl alcohol, it becomes dimethyl (E)-but-2-enedioate: CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3.
But arranged as (E)-configuration, the groups on the double bond would be opposite.
For example, the CH2 groups would have the COOCH3 groups on opposite sides.
But this is a geometrical isomerism (E vs Z), not optical isomerism.
Unless there's a chiral center here.
Looking at the structure: CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3.
The central part is a double bond between C2 and C3.
Each carbon in the double bond is connected to two substituents.
For C2: one CH2(COOCH3) and one CH3COO (if considering substituents on the double bond).
Wait, maybe not.
The actual substituents on the double bond are COOCH3 groups.
Wait, no.
The structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2-COOCH3?
No, no.
Wait, fumarate is an unsaturated diester.
The double bond is between two CH2 groups?
No, in fumarate, the double bond is between the two central carbons.
So, dimethyl fumarate is (CH2-COOCH3)-CH2-CH2-(COOCH3)?
No, wait, maybe not.
Wait, structure of fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH.
When methylated, it becomes CH2-COOCH3-CH=CH-COOCH3.
But actually, the correct structure is O=C-O-CH3 attached to CH2-CH2-COOCH3 with a double bond between the two central carbons.
Wait, regardless of the exact structure, the point is that fumarate is an E-isomer, which is a type of geometric isomerism, but not optical isomerism.
So, unless there is a chiral center, which there isn't in this structure.
The molecule is symmetric; each side has a COOCH3 group and is a diester.
Therefore, there is no chiral center here, so no optical isomerism.
Hence, compound 4 does not have optical isomers.
Therefore, the answer should be that only compound 2 has optical isomers.
But none of the answer choices support this.
The answer choices are A) 1 and 2, B) 1,2 and 4, C)3 and 4, D)2 and 3.
Since the correct answer based on analysis is 2, but the closest answer provided would be D) 2 and 3, but I concluded 3 is wrong.
Wait, maybe I made a mistake with 3 again.
Let me check once more.
Benzophenone: structure is (C6H5)2CO.
The central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and a double-bonded oxygen.
Since both substituents on the carbon are the same (two phenyl groups), this is a ketone.
Ketones don't have chiral centers unless the carbon they're attached to has four different substituents.
In the case of benzophenone, the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and one double bond to oxygen.
So, that's two substituents.
Wait, perhaps if the two phenyl groups are on different sides?
No, in a ketone, the structure is R-CO-R', but in benzophenone, both R groups are phenyl.
So, the structure is Ar-CO-Ar (where Ar is phenyl).
This molecule has a plane of symmetry between the two phenyl groups, so it is achiral.
Therefore, no optical activity.
So, 3 is out.
Therefore, only compound 2 is correct.
But the answer options don't have this.
Hmm.
Alternatively, maybe the question refers to potential chirality but doesn't consider symmetry.
For example, if a molecule has a chiral center but is a meso compound, then it's achiral.
But in compound 1, even if there's a chiral center, the entire molecule might be meso.
But compound 1 is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.
If each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate at 2, and the rings are connected at 1,1', then the substituents are mirror images.
So, if each ring has a nitro in the para position of the connecting bond and a carboxylate in the ortho, the entire molecule is symmetric.
Therefore, even if there are chiral centers, the molecule is meso.
Similarly, compound 3 is symmetric, so even if the central carbon is a chiral center, the overall molecule is achiral.
So, only compound 2 is truly chiral.
But answer choices don't have just 2.
So, there must be an error in the question or answer choices.
However, given the available options, the user might have made a mistake in the question.
Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake.
Let me check compound 2 once more.
Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: if that's CH3-CHOH-COOCH3, then the middle carbon (C2) is attached to four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H.
Therefore, it's a chiral center, so exists as R and S configurations, leading to optical isomers.
Therefore, correct.
Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate.
If the structure is (E)-CH2-COOCH3-CH=CH-COOCH3, but no, wait, fumarate is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH.
So, dimethyl fumarate would be O=C-OCH3-CH=CH-OOCCH3.
Wait, no.
Wait, dimethyl fumarate would have two methyl esters.
So, both COOH groups are esterified.
So, the structure would be CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3.
But this is still an E/Z isomerism.
For example, the two COOCH3 groups could be on the same side (Z) or opposite sides (E).
But this is geometric isomerism, not optical isomerism.
However, if the molecule has a chiral center, maybe if one of the carbons in the double bond has two different substituents.
Wait, but in the structure CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3, each carbon in the double bond is connected to:
- For the left-hand CH in the double bond (C2): attached to CH2(COOCH3) and COOCH3?
No.
Wait, the double bond is between C2 and C3.
So, the left-hand side (C2) is connected to CH2(COOCH3) and the double bond.
Then, C3 is connected to COOCH3 and the double bond.
So, each carbon in the double bond is only connected to two different groups.
For example, C2 is connected to CH2(COOCH3) and C3.
Wait, but in reality, the substituents on a double bond are considered for E/Z.
However, for chirality, we need a carbon with four different substituents.
In this case, all carbons in the molecule are either CH2 or have the COOCH3 group.
For instance, the central structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3.
So, the CH2 groups are on the ends, and the central part is the double bond.
There are no chiral centers here.
Therefore, no optical isomerism.
So, compound 4 is out.
So, the correct answer is 2.
But since the answer choices don't include just 2, but D) is 2 and 3, but 3 is incorrect.
Therefore, perhaps the question has a mistake, or maybe I'm missing something.
Wait, maybe compound 3 is different.
Let me confirm the structure of benzophenone once more.
Benzophenone is C6H5-CO-C6H5.
The central carbon is connected via double bond to oxygen.
So, the structure is:
Ph-C(=O)-Ph
Here, the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and a double-bonded oxygen.
So, the substituents on the carbon are two phenyl groups.
If the two phenyl groups are on the same side, that would be a kind of cis isomer, but since there's no double bond, you can't have cis-trans isomerism here.
However, in reality, once the molecule is formed, the substituents around the carbon are in a trigonal planar structure (since carbonyl is sp2 hybridized).
Therefore, the two phenyl groups can rotate freely unless there's a bulky group.
But regardless, the point is that benzophenone is a planar molecule with two phenyl groups attached to the same carbon, which is part of a carbonyl group.
Since both phenyl groups are identical, there is no chiral center here.
Therefore, no optical isomerism.
So, compound 3 is incorrect.
Therefore, the only compound with optical isomerism is 2.
But none of the answer options is just 2.
The options are A) 1 and 2, B) 1,2 and 4, C)3 and 4, D)2 and 3.
Since the analysis leads to only 2, but the closest answer provided is none.
However, given the options, the user might have made a mistake in the question.
Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is D) 2 and 3, but I concluded 3 is wrong.
But maybe in some cases, even if a molecule is meso, it can show optical activity?
No, meso compounds are achiral.
Alternatively, perhaps benzophenone can undergo some kind of non-racemic synthesis, but in general, benzophenone itself is not a chiral molecule.
Therefore, if the answer isn't among the options, I need to check once again.
Wait, maybe methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (compound 2) is not a chiral molecule.
Let me confirm the structure once more.
Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the formula would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.
Wait, but propanoate is CH2CH2COO-.
So, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl group on the second carbon: CH2(OH)CH2COO-.
Then, methyl ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.
But wait, the correct structure of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (lactic acid) is HOCH2CH(COOH).
No, wait.
For propanoic acid, the chain is CH3CH2COOH.
The positions are:
1: CH3-
2: CH2-
3: COOH
Wait, no.
Actually, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH.
So, the carbons are 1 (CH3), 2 (CH2), 3 (COOH).
So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl group on the middle carbon: CH3-CHOH-COOH.
Then, converting the COOH to a methyl ester, we get CH3-CHOH-COOCH3.
But in this structure, the middle carbon (C2) is chiral?
No, the C2 carbon in this case would be connected to:
- CH3 (from the first carbon)
- COOCH3 (from the carboxylate ester group)
- two substituents on C2: OH and H?
Wait, no.
If the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3, then the C2 carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:
- CH3 (from the previous carbon)
- OH
- H
- COOCH3 (from the adjacent carbon)
Wait, no.
Let me count the substituents on the C2 atom (the one with OH):
In CH3-CHOH-COOCH3, the structure is:
Carbon 1: CH3-
Carbon 2: -CHOH-
Carbon 3: -COOCH3
So, Carbon 2 is connected to:
- Carbon 1 (which is CH3)
- Carbon 3 (which is C(OOH)CH3, but in this case, it's part of the same chain)
Wait, actually, Carbon 2 has these substituents:
- CH2OH (since it's CH3-CHOH-...)
Wait, maybe I need to represent it as a tetrahedral carbon.
If the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3, the C2 carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:
- Two other carbons (from the chain)
- OH
- H
Wait, but in reality, the structure is:
O
|
CH3-CH(-OH)-C(=O)-OCH3
So, in this case, the C2 carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:
- CH3 (from the adjacent carbon)
- OH
- H
- COOCH3 (but that's on the next carbon)
Wait, no.
The carbon framework is:
1: CH3-
2: -CH(OH)-
3: -C(=O)-OCH3
So, carbon 2 is connected to:
- Carbon 1 (which is CH3)
- Carbon 3 (which is part of the C(=O)-OCH3 group)
- Hydroxyl group (OH)
- Hydrogen (since it's CH(OH)...)
Wait, but in that case, carbon 2 has only four bonds:
- One bond to carbon 1 (in the chain)
- One bond to carbon 3 (in the chain)
- One bond to OH
- One bond to H
Therefore, the carbon 2 is part of the chain, with two bonds to other carbons, one to OH, and one to H.
Therefore, the carbon 2 is CH(OH)H.
Wait, no.
If the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-C(=O)-OCH3, then carbon 2 is CH(OH)H, with two substituents from the chain.
But in this case, the central carbon (carbon 2) is connected to:
- One CH3 group (from carbon 1)
- One COOCH3 group (from carbon 3)
- OH
- H
Wait, no.
Because carbon 2 is in the middle, so its bonds are:
- To carbon 1 (which is CH3)
- To carbon 3 (which is C(=O)-OCH3)
- To OH
- To H
Therefore, the carbon 2 is *CH*(OH)H, with two bonds to adjacent carbons in the chain, an OH group, and a hydrogen.
Therefore, carbon 2 has four substituents: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H.
Therefore, carbon 2 is a chiral center because all four substituents are different.
Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (compound 2) has a chiral center and thus exists as optical isomers (R and S configurations relative to carbon 2).
Therefore, compound 2 does exhibit optical isomerism.
So, that's correct.
Therefore, the answer should be the option that includes 2.
But according to the provided answer choices, the correct answers are either A) 1 and 2, B) 1,2 and 4, C)3 and 4, D)2 and 3.
Since only 2 is correct, but D) is 2 and 3.
Since 3 is incorrect, the answer isn't there.
But maybe the user intended something else.
Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake with compound 1.
Let me check once again.
Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.
If the biphenyl is connected at 1,1', and each ring has nitro groups at 6' and 6, and carboxylate groups at 2' and 2, then the positions would be as follows:
Each ring has a nitro group at position 6 (which is across from the connecting bond, para position) and a carboxylate group at position 2 (ortho to the connecting bond).
This arrangement would result in the molecule being highly symmetrical.
If each ring is substituted in the same way, then the entire molecule would be symmetric through the plane that bisects the two rings.
Therefore, any optical activity from one side would be canceled out by the other, making the molecule meso.
Therefore, even if there are chiral centers (such as the two carbons where the carboxylate and nitro groups are attached), the molecule as a whole is achiral due to the plane of symmetry.
Hence, compound 1 does not exhibit optical isomerism.
Thus, only compound 2 is correct.

okay, so i need to figure out which of the given organic compounds show optical isomerism.
the options are 1, 2, 3, and 4, and then the answer choices combine these numbers.
let me recall what optical isomerism is.
optical isomers are a type of stereoisomerism where the molecules are mirror images of each other and are not superimposable.
this usually occurs when there is a chiral center in the molecule, which is an atom (usually carbon) that is bonded to four different groups.
so, first, i need to analyze each compound to see if they have chiral centers or any other features that lead to optical isomerism.
let's take each one by one.
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>
<goal>
<outline>
1: determine optical isomerism for compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

</goal>
<path>
1: compound 1 is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.
the compound is a biphenyl derivative with nitro groups at positions 6 and 6', and carboxylate groups at positions 2 and 2'.
the carboxylate groups are esterified with methyl groups.
the biphenyl core consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond.
the positions of substitution are 2, 2', 6, and 6'.
the biphenyl structure itself can exhibit certain types of isomerism, such as e/z isomerism if substituents are arranged appropriately.
however, the question concerns optical isomerism, which arises from chiral centers.
chiral centers in biphenyl derivatives typically require a central atom attached to four different groups.
biphenyl systems, particularly those substituted at the 1 and 1' positions, can sometimes possess a plane of symmetry.
this specific compound is substituted on each benzene ring at the 2 and 6 positions.
the 2,2'-dicarboxylate groups are located ortho to the connecting bond, while the 6,6'-dinitro groups are located para to the connecting bond.
the structure can be visualized as the two benzene rings linked at positions 1 and 1'.
on each ring, the substituents are at positions 2 (carboxylate) and 6 (nitro).
the 2 position is adjacent to the connecting bond, and the 6 position is meta to the connecting bond.
the presence of two identical substituents (nitro groups at 6 and 6') and two identical ester groups (dimethyl dicarboxylate at 2 and 2') suggests that the compound might have a plane of symmetry.
this symmetry implies that the molecule is not chiral.
a molecule with a plane of symmetry cannot be optically active.
therefore, compound 1 does not exhibit optical isomerism.

2: compound 2 is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.
let's think in parallel.

2.1: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of lactic acid.
its structure is ch3-ch(oh)-coo-ch3.
</path>
<path>
2.2: the carbon atom at position 2 is bonded to a hydroxyl group (oh), a hydrogen atom (h), a methyl group (ch3), and a carbon chain (from the adjacent carbon, likely part of a larger structure).
</path>
<conclusion>
compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) has a structure ch3-ch(oh)-coo-ch3, and the carbon at position 2 is connected to four different groups.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
this configuration forms a chiral center at the c2 carbon, indicating the possibility of optical isomers.
the presence of a chiral center confirms that compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism.
</path>
<path>
3: compound 3 is benzophenone, the structure of which is a benzene ring attached to a ketone (c=o) group. the molecular formula for benzophenone is c13h10o. in this structure, the central carbon of the ketone is bonded to two phenyl groups. the carbon atom in the ketone group is bonded to two phenyl groups and two oxygen atoms. this configuration results in the carbon being bonded to four substituents: two phenyl groups and two oxygen atoms (one from the carbonyl group, c=o, and one from any possible single bond). this arrangement satisfies the condition of four different groups attached to a single carbon atom, making this carbon a chiral center. the presence of a chiral center implies the possibility of optical isomers. benzophenone, however, is a planar molecule. the two phenyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon are in the same plane due to the rigidity introduced by the adjacent benzene rings. this planar structure prevents the molecule from existing in two different spatial arrangements. the molecule cannot rotate freely about the c=o bond due to the bulky benzene rings. the inability to rotate leads to the molecule being locked in a single plane, preventing the formation of enantiomers. consequently, benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism despite having a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. the reason for this exception is the molecule's planarity, which arises from the rigid benzene rings. benzophenone thus does not possess optical isomers.

4.1: fumarate is the e-configuration of butenedioic acid.
the dimethyl ester would have two methyl ester groups substituting for two hydroxyl groups.
the molecular structure of dimethyl fumarate involves a conjugated diene structure.
the double bonds in fumarate are conjugated, but the molecule itself is symmetrical.
the structure is r-ooc-ch2-ch2-coor, where r is the methyl group.
the central ch2 group is identical on both sides.
the central carbon atom in the chain is bonded to two ch2 groups, an ester group, and another ester group.
this symmetry suggests that the central carbon is not a chiral center.
the central carbon is therefore not a chiral center.
the molecule is symmetrical, with no chiral centers.
</path>
<path>
4.2: fumarate is the e-isomer of butenedioic acid, and dimethyl fumarate is the e-diester.
geometric isomerism, specifically e/z isomerism, occurs in alkenes with different substituents on each carbon.
the e configuration indicates opposite substituents.
fumarate, as an e-isomer, is geometrically distinct from the z-isomer (maleate).
however, the question concerns optical isomerism.
</path>
<path>
4.3: dimethyl fumarate exhibits geometric isomerism, not optical isomerism.

dimethyl fumarate lacks a chiral center and possesses geometric isomerism (e configuration). it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

</path>
<conclusion>
compound 1 (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate) does not show optical isomerism due to its planar structure. compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) shows optical isomerism because it possesses a chiral center. compound 3 (benzophenone) does not show optical isomerism despite having a chiral carbon due to its planar structure. compound 4 (dimethyl fumarate) exhibits geometric isomerism but not optical isomerism.

so among the options, only 2 shows optical isomerism.
let's check the answer choices:
a) 1 and 2 - but 1 doesn't have.
b) 1, 2 and 4 - nope, 1 and 4 don't.
c) 3 and 4 - neither 3 nor 4 have.
d) 2 and 3 - but 3 doesn't.
wait, but according to my analysis, only compound 2 has optical isomers.
but none of the answer choices is just 2.
hmm. wait, maybe i made a mistake.
let me check again.
wait, maybe fumarate (compound 4) can have optical isomers?
wait, fumarate is e-malate diester.
since fumarate is a geometric isomer (e vs z), but enantiomers would be different if there's a chiral center.
wait, in the case of dimethyl fumarate, the molecule is e-configured, but is fumarate also capable of having optical activity?
wait, fumaric acid (e-isomer) is actually meso when considering potential chiral centers.
wait, wait.
let me think.
fumaric acid is e-ethenedioic acid.
the structure is hooc-ch2-ch2-cooh.
wait, no, no.
no, wait, fumaric acid is hooc-ch=ch-cooh, with e-configuration.
the double bond is between c2 and c3.
each carbon in the double bond is connected to a cooh group and a ch2 group.
wait, but each carbon in the double bond is part of the conjugated system.
since it's a double bond, those carbons are sp2 hybridized.
so, they have trigonal planar geometry.
therefore, no possibility of optical isomerism here.
optical isomerism requires a chiral center, not just a double bond.
so, even though fumarate has geometric isomerism (e vs z), it does not have optical isomerism.
unless, if the molecule has a chiral center.
wait, but in dimethyl fumarate, the ester groups would be on the cooh ends.
so, the central part is still the conjugated double bond.
so, no, the chirality isn't introduced here.
so, compound 4 is incorrect.
therefore, only compound 2 is correct.
but the answer options don't have just 2.
hmm.
wait, maybe i made a mistake with benzophenone?
wait, benzophenone's structure is (c6h5)2co.
the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and a carbonyl group.
so, the carbon in the carbonyl is part of a c=o double bond.
so, that carbon is bonded to o (double bond), and two phenyl groups.
wait, but in that case, the carbon in the carbonyl group is connected to three substituents: o and two phenyls?
wait, no.
the structure is ph2co.
so, the central carbon is connected via double bond to o and has two phenyl groups.
so, actually, the central carbon is bonded to o (double bond) and two phenyl groups.
that would be only three substituents.
but carbon has four bonds.
wait, right, the other bond is a single bond.
wait, perhaps there's a mistake here.
benzophenone is (c6h5)2co.
so, structure is:
ph-c(=o)- ?
no, no.
wait, benzophenone is diphenyl ketone.
so, the ketone structure is:
ph-co-ph
which is ph2c=o.
so, the central carbon is bonded via double bond to oxygen and via two single bonds to phenyl groups.
so, the central carbon in the ketone has three substituents: two phenyl groups and one double bond to oxygen.
but since it's a carbonyl group, that's a double bond.
so, actually, the central carbon is only bonded to three groups: two phenyls and one oxygen (as a double bond).
then, the fourth bond is a lone pair?
no, carbons don't have lone pairs.
wait, no.
all bonds are taken.
for a ketone group, the carbonyl carbon is bonded to o (double bond) and two substituted groups (here, phenyl).
so, that's two single bonds to phenyl and a double bond to oxygen.
so, total of four bonds.
so, that carbon is bonded to o and two phenyl groups.
so, if both phenyl groups are the same, then that carbon isn't a chiral center because the two phenyl groups are the same.
so, in that case, the central carbon is symmetrical.
so, in benzophenone, since both substituents on the carbonyl carbon are phenyl (same group), then that carbon is not a chiral center.
therefore, benzophenone is not a chiral molecule.
therefore, no optical isomerism.
so, i was correct before.
therefore, compound 3 is not a chiral molecule.
so, only compound 2 is.
therefore, the answer should be the option that includes only 2.
but looking at the options, there's no option with only 2.
hmm.
wait, perhaps methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is not a chiral molecule?
let's re-examine compound 2.
methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.
let's draw the structure.
the carboxylic acid is converted to an ester, so the structure is ch2(cooch3)ch2oh.
wait, no.
wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate is lactic acid.
so, methyl lactate would be ch2(oh)ch2cooch3?
wait, no.
wait, propanoate is ch2ch2coo-.
so, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be hoch2ch2coo-.
then, methyl ester would be hoch2ch2cooch3.
but wait, the correct structure of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (lactic acid) is hoch2ch(cooh).
no, wait.
let's get the structure right.
propanoic acid is ch2ch2cooh.
2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl group on the second carbon: ho-ch2-ch(cooh)-.
wait, no.
for propanoic acid, the chain is ch3ch2cooh.
the positions are:
1: ch3-
2: ch2-
3: cooh
wait, no.
actually, propanoic acid is ch3ch2cooh.
so, the carbons are 1 (ch3), 2 (ch2), 3 (cooh).
so, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl group on the middle carbon: ch3-choh-cooh.
then, converting the cooh to a cooch3 ester group, we get ch3-choh-cooch3.
so, the structure has a chirality center at the middle carbon (c2) because it is attached to -ch3, -oh, -cooch3, and a hydrogen (if any?) wait, no.
wait, in 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is ch2(oh)ch2coo- ?
wait, i'm getting confused here.
let's think again.
the correct structure of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is indeed lactic acid: ch3-choh-cooh.
so, when we make the methyl ester, we get ch3-choh-cooch3 (methyl lactate).
the carbon atom at position 2 (the c connected to oh) is connected to:
- ch3 (from the neighboring carbon)
- oh
- cooch3 (attached to the same carbon)
- and a hydrogen?
wait, the c2 in lactic acid is already connected to oh, cooh (which becomes cooch3), and two ch3 groups?
wait, maybe not.
let me number the carbons properly.
in lactic acid: the -ch3 is c1.
the -choh is c2.
the -cooh is c3.
so, c2 is ch(oh)-.
then, when forming the methyl ester, the cooh becomes cooch3.
but the structure is still:
c1: -ch3
c2: -choh-
c3: -cooch3
but c2 is connected to what?
c1 (which is ch3), c3 (which is cooch3), oh, and a hydrogen?
wait, no.
if c2 is ch(oh), then the structure is:
c1-c2-c3
where c1 is ch3, c2 is ch(oh), and c3 is cooch3.
but c2 has to have four bonds.
so, c2 would be connected to:
- one bond to c1 (which is ch3)
- one bond to c3 (which is cooch3)
- one bond to oh
- and one bond to a hydrogen.
so, c2 is ch(oh)(h) connected to c1 and c3.
wait, but that would make c2 as -ch(oh)-, with substituents: one ch3 (from c1), one cooch3 (from c3), oh, and h.
therefore, c2 is connected to four different groups: ch3, cooch3, oh, and h.
therefore, c2 is a chiral center.
therefore, even in the methyl ester (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate), the c2 carbon is still attached to four different groups, making it a chiral center.
therefore, compound 2 does indeed have optical isomers.
so, the answer should include 2.
so, which answer choices include 2?
a) 1 and 2 - but 1 is incorrect.
b) 1, 2 and 4 - but 1 and 4 are incorrect.
c) 3 and 4 - incorrect.
d) 2 and 3 - but 3 is incorrect.
wait, so there's a mistake in the answer choices?
because according to my analysis, only 2 is correct.
but none of the options is just 2.
hmm.
wait, maybe i made a mistake with compound 1?
let me check again.
compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.
so, this is a biphenyl molecule where each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate group at position 2.
both carboxylates are esterified with methyl groups.
the biphenyl is connected at positions 1 and 1'.
the substitution is at 2, 2', 6, and 6'.
so, each ring has a nitro group in the para position relative to the connecting bond (position 6 is four positions away from 1 and 1'), but the rings are connected at 1,1'.
wait, in biphenyl systems, the numbering would go such that the two connected carbons are positions 1 and 1'.
then, substituents on each ring are numbered accordingly.
so, in this case, each ring has a nitro group at position 6 (which is the para position relative to the connecting bond) and a carboxylate group at position 2.
so, the structure would be symmetric.
if the molecule is symmetric, then there won't be any chiral centers.
for example, if substituents are placed at positions 2 and 6 on both rings, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, thus making it achiral.
however, if the substitution leads to a lack of symmetry, it could be chiral.
but in this case, 6,6'-dinitro and 2,2'-dicarboxylate suggests that the substituents are mirror-symmetrical.
so, each ring has a nitro group at the para position of the connecting ring and a carboxylate at the ortho position.
therefore, the entire molecule would have a plane of symmetry between the two rings.
hence, it is achiral and does not have optical isomers.
therefore, compound 1 is incorrect.
so, only compound 2 is correct.
but the answer choices don't have an option with only 2.
hmm.
then, perhaps the answer intended is d) 2 and 3, but 3 is incorrect.
wait, but maybe i made a mistake with benzophenone (compound 3).
let's check again.
benzophenone is (c6h5)2co.
the structure is two phenyl groups attached to a carbonyl group.
the central carbon in the carbonyl is connected to two phenyl groups and a double-bonded oxygen.
since both substituents on the carbonyl carbon are the same (both phenyl groups), this carbon is not a chiral center.
additionally, because the molecule is symmetrical, there are no chiral centers.
therefore, benzophenone is achiral and does not have optical isomers.
so, compound 3 is incorrect.
therefore, the answer options don't include the correct answer if only 2 is correct.
but perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem?
or maybe i made a mistake?
alternatively, maybe compound 4, dimethyl fumarate, can have optical isomerism.
let me check again.
fumarate is the e-isomer of butenedioic acid.
the structure is hooc-ch2-ch2-cooh (but that's succinate).
no, fumaric acid is hooc-ch=ch-cooh, e-configured.
so, dimethyl fumarate would be the diester: ch2(cooch3)-ch2-ch2-cooch3?
no, wait, fumarate is the acid, so replacing the two cooh groups with cooch3.
so, dimethyl fumarate would be ch2(cooch3)-ch=ch-cooch3.
wait, but fumarate's double bond is between c2 and c3.
so, the molecule would be hooc-ch2-ch2-cooh (succinate) vs. hooc-ch=ch-cooh (fumarate).
so, dimethyl fumarate would be (ch3coo)-ch2-ch2-ch2-(cooch3).
no, wait, no.
wait, fumarate is (e)-but-2-enedioic acid.
the structure is hooc-ch=ch-cooh.
when esterified with methyl alcohol, it becomes dimethyl (e)-but-2-enedioate: ch2(cooch3)-ch=ch-cooch3.
but arranged as (e)-configuration, the groups on the double bond would be opposite.
for example, the ch2 groups would have the cooch3 groups on opposite sides.
but this is a geometrical isomerism (e vs z), not optical isomerism.
unless there's a chiral center here.
looking at the structure: ch2(cooch3)-ch=ch-cooch3.
the central part is a double bond between c2 and c3.
each carbon in the double bond is connected to two substituents.
for c2: one ch2(cooch3) and one ch3coo (if considering substituents on the double bond).
wait, maybe not.
the actual substituents on the double bond are cooch3 groups.
wait, no.
the structure is ch2(cooch3)-ch2-ch2-cooch3?
no, no.
wait, fumarate is an unsaturated diester.
the double bond is between two ch2 groups?
no, in fumarate, the double bond is between the two central carbons.
so, dimethyl fumarate is (ch2-cooch3)-ch2-ch2-(cooch3)?
no, wait, maybe not.
wait, structure of fumaric acid is hooc-ch=ch-cooh.
when methylated, it becomes ch2-cooch3-ch=ch-cooch3.
but actually, the correct structure is o=c-o-ch3 attached to ch2-ch2-cooch3 with a double bond between the two central carbons.
wait, regardless of the exact structure, the point is that fumarate is an e-isomer, which is a type of geometric isomerism, but not optical isomerism.
so, unless there is a chiral center, which there isn't in this structure.
the molecule is symmetric; each side has a cooch3 group and is a diester.
therefore, there is no chiral center here, so no optical isomerism.
hence, compound 4 does not have optical isomers.
therefore, the answer should be that only compound 2 has optical isomers.
but none of the answer choices support this.
the answer choices are a) 1 and 2, b) 1,2 and 4, c)3 and 4, d)2 and 3.
since the correct answer based on analysis is 2, but the closest answer provided would be d) 2 and 3, but i concluded 3 is wrong.
wait, maybe i made a mistake with 3 again.
let me check once more.
benzophenone: structure is (c6h5)2co.
the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and a double-bonded oxygen.
since both substituents on the carbon are the same (two phenyl groups), this is a ketone.
ketones don't have chiral centers unless the carbon they're attached to has four different substituents.
in the case of benzophenone, the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and one double bond to oxygen.
so, that's two substituents.
wait, perhaps if the two phenyl groups are on different sides?
no, in a ketone, the structure is r-co-r', but in benzophenone, both r groups are phenyl.
so, the structure is ar-co-ar (where ar is phenyl).
this molecule has a plane of symmetry between the two phenyl groups, so it is achiral.
therefore, no optical activity.
so, 3 is out.
therefore, only compound 2 is correct.
but the answer options don't have this.
hmm.
alternatively, maybe the question refers to potential chirality but doesn't consider symmetry.
for example, if a molecule has a chiral center but is a meso compound, then it's achiral.
but in compound 1, even if there's a chiral center, the entire molecule might be meso.
but compound 1 is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.
if each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate at 2, and the rings are connected at 1,1', then the substituents are mirror images.
so, if each ring has a nitro in the para position of the connecting bond and a carboxylate in the ortho, the entire molecule is symmetric.
therefore, even if there are chiral centers, the molecule is meso.
similarly, compound 3 is symmetric, so even if the central carbon is a chiral center, the overall molecule is achiral.
so, only compound 2 is truly chiral.
but answer choices don't have just 2.
so, there must be an error in the question or answer choices.
however, given the available options, the user might have made a mistake in the question.
alternatively, maybe i made a mistake.
let me check compound 2 once more.
methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: if that's ch3-choh-cooch3, then the middle carbon (c2) is attached to four different groups: ch3, oh, cooch3, and h.
therefore, it's a chiral center, so exists as r and s configurations, leading to optical isomers.
therefore, correct.
compound 4: dimethyl fumarate.
if the structure is (e)-ch2-cooch3-ch=ch-cooch3, but no, wait, fumarate is hooc-ch=ch-cooh.
so, dimethyl fumarate would be o=c-och3-ch=ch-oocch3.
wait, no.
wait, dimethyl fumarate would have two methyl esters.
so, both cooh groups are esterified.
so, the structure would be ch2(cooch3)-ch=ch-cooch3.
but this is still an e/z isomerism.
for example, the two cooch3 groups could be on the same side (z) or opposite sides (e).
but this is geometric isomerism, not optical isomerism.
however, if the molecule has a chiral center, maybe if one of the carbons in the double bond has two different substituents.
wait, but in the structure ch2(cooch3)-ch=ch-cooch3, each carbon in the double bond is connected to:
- for the left-hand ch in the double bond (c2): attached to ch2(cooch3) and cooch3?
no.
wait, the double bond is between c2 and c3.
so, the left-hand side (c2) is connected to ch2(cooch3) and the double bond.
then, c3 is connected to cooch3 and the double bond.
so, each carbon in the double bond is only connected to two different groups.
for example, c2 is connected to ch2(cooch3) and c3.
wait, but in reality, the substituents on a double bond are considered for e/z.
however, for chirality, we need a carbon with four different substituents.
in this case, all carbons in the molecule are either ch2 or have the cooch3 group.
for instance, the central structure is ch2(cooch3)-ch=ch-cooch3.
so, the ch2 groups are on the ends, and the central part is the double bond.
there are no chiral centers here.
therefore, no optical isomerism.
so, compound 4 is out.
so, the correct answer is 2.
but since the answer choices don't include just 2, but d) is 2 and 3, but 3 is incorrect.
therefore, perhaps the question has a mistake, or maybe i'm missing something.
wait, maybe compound 3 is different.
let me confirm the structure of benzophenone once more.
benzophenone is c6h5-co-c6h5.
the central carbon is connected via double bond to oxygen.
so, the structure is:
ph-c(=o)-ph
here, the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and a double-bonded oxygen.
so, the substituents on the carbon are two phenyl groups.
if the two phenyl groups are on the same side, that would be a kind of cis isomer, but since there's no double bond, you can't have cis-trans isomerism here.
however, in reality, once the molecule is formed, the substituents around the carbon are in a trigonal planar structure (since carbonyl is sp2 hybridized).
therefore, the two phenyl groups can rotate freely unless there's a bulky group.
but regardless, the point is that benzophenone is a planar molecule with two phenyl groups attached to the same carbon, which is part of a carbonyl group.
since both phenyl groups are identical, there is no chiral center here.
therefore, no optical isomerism.
so, compound 3 is incorrect.
therefore, the only compound with optical isomerism is 2.
but none of the answer options is just 2.
the options are a) 1 and 2, b) 1,2 and 4, c)3 and 4, d)2 and 3.
since the analysis leads to only 2, but the closest answer provided is none.
however, given the options, the user might have made a mistake in the question.
alternatively, maybe the correct answer is d) 2 and 3, but i concluded 3 is wrong.
but maybe in some cases, even if a molecule is meso, it can show optical activity?
no, meso compounds are achiral.
alternatively, perhaps benzophenone can undergo some kind of non-racemic synthesis, but in general, benzophenone itself is not a chiral molecule.
therefore, if the answer isn't among the options, i need to check once again.
wait, maybe methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (compound 2) is not a chiral molecule.
let me confirm the structure once more.
methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the formula would be ch2(oh)ch2cooch3.
wait, but propanoate is ch2ch2coo-.
so, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl group on the second carbon: ch2(oh)ch2coo-.
then, methyl ester would be ch2(oh)ch2cooch3.
but wait, the correct structure of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (lactic acid) is hoch2ch(cooh).
no, wait.
for propanoic acid, the chain is ch3ch2cooh.
the positions are:
1: ch3-
2: ch2-
3: cooh
wait, no.
actually, propanoic acid is ch3ch2cooh.
so, the carbons are 1 (ch3), 2 (ch2), 3 (cooh).
so, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl group on the middle carbon: ch3-choh-cooh.
then, converting the cooh to a methyl ester, we get ch3-choh-cooch3.
but in this structure, the middle carbon (c2) is chiral?
no, the c2 carbon in this case would be connected to:
- ch3 (from the first carbon)
- cooch3 (from the carboxylate ester group)
- two substituents on c2: oh and h?
wait, no.
if the structure is ch3-choh-cooch3, then the c2 carbon (the one with oh) is connected to:
- ch3 (from the previous carbon)
- oh
- h
- cooch3 (from the adjacent carbon)
wait, no.
let me count the substituents on the c2 atom (the one with oh):
in ch3-choh-cooch3, the structure is:
carbon 1: ch3-
carbon 2: -choh-
carbon 3: -cooch3
so, carbon 2 is connected to:
- carbon 1 (which is ch3)
- carbon 3 (which is c(ooh)ch3, but in this case, it's part of the same chain)
wait, actually, carbon 2 has these substituents:
- ch2oh (since it's ch3-choh-...)
wait, maybe i need to represent it as a tetrahedral carbon.
if the structure is ch3-choh-cooch3, the c2 carbon (the one with oh) is connected to:
- two other carbons (from the chain)
- oh
- h
wait, but in reality, the structure is:
o
|
ch3-ch(-oh)-c(=o)-och3
so, in this case, the c2 carbon (the one with oh) is connected to:
- ch3 (from the adjacent carbon)
- oh
- h
- cooch3 (but that's on the next carbon)
wait, no.
the carbon framework is:
1: ch3-
2: -ch(oh)-
3: -c(=o)-och3
so, carbon 2 is connected to:
- carbon 1 (which is ch3)
- carbon 3 (which is part of the c(=o)-och3 group)
- hydroxyl group (oh)
- hydrogen (since it's ch(oh)...)
wait, but in that case, carbon 2 has only four bonds:
- one bond to carbon 1 (in the chain)
- one bond to carbon 3 (in the chain)
- one bond to oh
- one bond to h
therefore, the carbon 2 is part of the chain, with two bonds to other carbons, one to oh, and one to h.
therefore, the carbon 2 is ch(oh)h.
wait, no.
if the structure is ch3-ch(oh)-c(=o)-och3, then carbon 2 is ch(oh)h, with two substituents from the chain.
but in this case, the central carbon (carbon 2) is connected to:
- one ch3 group (from carbon 1)
- one cooch3 group (from carbon 3)
- oh
- h
wait, no.
because carbon 2 is in the middle, so its bonds are:
- to carbon 1 (which is ch3)
- to carbon 3 (which is c(=o)-och3)
- to oh
- to h
therefore, the carbon 2 is *ch*(oh)h, with two bonds to adjacent carbons in the chain, an oh group, and a hydrogen.
therefore, carbon 2 has four substituents: ch3, cooch3, oh, and h.
therefore, carbon 2 is a chiral center because all four substituents are different.
therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (compound 2) has a chiral center and thus exists as optical isomers (r and s configurations relative to carbon 2).
therefore, compound 2 does exhibit optical isomerism.
so, that's correct.
therefore, the answer should be the option that includes 2.
but according to the provided answer choices, the correct answers are either a) 1 and 2, b) 1,2 and 4, c)3 and 4, d)2 and 3.
since only 2 is correct, but d) is 2 and 3.
since 3 is incorrect, the answer isn't there.
but maybe the user intended something else.
alternatively, maybe i made a mistake with compound 1.
let me check once again.
compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.
if the biphenyl is connected at 1,1', and each ring has nitro groups at 6' and 6, and carboxylate groups at 2' and 2, then the positions would be as follows:
each ring has a nitro group at position 6 (which is across from the connecting bond, para position) and a carboxylate group at position 2 (ortho to the connecting bond).
this arrangement would result in the molecule being highly symmetrical.
if each ring is substituted in the same way, then the entire molecule would be symmetric through the plane that bisects the two rings.
therefore, any optical activity from one side would be canceled out by the other, making the molecule meso.
therefore, even if there are chiral centers (such as the two carbons where the carboxylate and nitro groups are attached), the molecule as a whole is achiral due to the plane of symmetry.
hence, compound 1 does not exhibit optical isomerism.
thus, only compound 2 is correct.
but the answer options
