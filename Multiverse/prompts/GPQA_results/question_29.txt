Okay, let's see. So the problem is about finding which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in a drought-resistant barley cultivar. The gene responsible for the compound has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis and sequenced the first exon area. We need to look at the mutations in the first exon and figure out which one would likely eliminate the compound.
First, let's remember that EMS (ethyl methanesulfonate) is a mutagen that typically causes point mutations, usually by alkylating DNA bases, often leading to base pair substitutions. So each mutant here probably has a single nucleotide change, but I need to check the sequences to confirm.
The intact gene's sequence starts with ATG (which is the start codon, so that's important). Then the rest is the coding sequence. The mutations are all in the first exon. Let's align each mutant sequence with the wild type to see what changed.
Let's think in parallel.

1: Mutant 1's sequence is compared to the intact gene. The intact sequence is 5'-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...TGA-3'. Mutant 1's sequence is 5'-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...TGA-3'. The differences are identified by aligning the sequences.
Mutant 1: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...
Wild type: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...
The initial comparison suggests no difference.
A recheck is performed.
The sequences are re-aligned.
Mutant 1: ATG-TTT-CTC-GCT-GGT-AC... (dashes added for separation)
Wild type: ATG-TTT-CTC-GCT-GGT-AC... (dashes added for separation)
The first six nucleotides (ATGTTT) match.
The next three nucleotides (CTC) match.
The next four nucleotides (GCGT) in the wild type are compared to Mutant 1's sequence.
The mutant sequence is examined after "ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTAC".
The mutant sequence following "ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTAC" is "TTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...".
The wild-type sequence after "ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTAC" is "TTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...".
The sequences diverge at the 27th nucleotide position.
The mutant's 27th nucleotide is C, while the wild-type's is T.
The 27th nucleotide in the wild type is T, which is replaced by C in Mutant 1.
The mutation is T to C at position 27.
The codon context is considered.
The first codon is ATG (Met).
The next codon is TTT (Phe).
The third codon is CTC (Leu).
The fourth codon is GCG (Ala).
The fifth codon is TGG (Trp).
The sixth codon is TAC (Tyr) in Mutant 1 versus TAT (Tyr) in the wild type.
The mutation is identified as T27C, changing TAT to TAC.
The codon change TAT (Tyr) to TAC (Tyr) is noted.
The amino acid remains Tyrosine.
The T27C mutation does not alter the amino acid sequence.
Mutant 1's mutation results in a synonymous substitution.

2: The sequence of Mutant 2 is ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...TGA. Comparing this with the intact gene, the first difference is observed at position 7, where a T (from the intact gene) is replaced by an A in Mutant 2. This is the first change.
The next comparison between positions 8 and 9 shows the intact gene has a C, while Mutant 2 has a C, indicating no change here.
At positions 10 and 11, the intact gene has a G, while Mutant 2 also has a G, showing no change.
At positions 12 and 13, the intact gene has a T, while Mutant 2 has a T, showing no change.
At positions 14 and 15, the intact gene has a C, while Mutant 2 also has a C, showing no change.
The next comparison at positions 16 and 17 shows the intact gene has a T, while Mutant 2 has an A, indicating a T to A substitution.
Therefore, Mutant 2 has two point mutations: a T to A substitution at position 7, and a T to A substitution at position 16.

3: Mutant 3's sequence is ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...TGA. Comparing to the wild type, the third position after ATG is T instead of T (no change), fourth is T instead of T (no change), fifth is T instead of T (no change). Wait, let's look again. Wait, the original sequence after ATG is TTTCTCGC. Wait, wait:
Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT ATT TGT CGT ... TGA
But wait, perhaps it's easier to convert the DNA sequence into mRNA and then to amino acids. Since the sequence is given as DNA (5' to 3'), mRNA is complementary, so for the coding strand, the mRNA would be complementary to the DNA's non-coding strand. But maybe an easier way is to transcribe the DNA into mRNA (replace T with U) and then translate.
But maybe the key is to find a mutation that introduces a stop codon early (nonsense mutation) or a frameshift, which would truncate the protein and possibly eliminate the anti-nutritional compound's production.
Let's think in parallel.

3.1: Let's check each mutant for such changes.
Starting with Mutant 1:
Original DNA: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT ATT TGT CGT ... TGA
Mutant 1 DNA: ATG T <u>TC</u> TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT ATT TGT CGC ...
So the change is from CTC to TAC (at position 3-6 maybe?). Wait, let me align them properly:
Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT ATT TGT CGT ... TGA
Mutant1: ATG T (original: C, Mutant1: T) So the third base in the second codon (original: TTT (F), CTC (L)) becomes TT<u>T</u> (still TTT, so same codon? Wait, no. Wait, let's break down.
Wait, maybe I should transcribe and translate each mutant.
Original DNA: 5'-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT ATT TGT CGT...TGA-3'
The mRNA would be the complementary sequence of the DNA (since DNA is the coding strand?), so the mRNA would be:
5'-AUG UUU CUU CGA GGU ACU UCU GUG GAU GAA CAU AUU AUU UGU CGU...UAA-3'
Wait, but DNA is given as the coding strand (since ATG is start codon, so in the DNA it's written as ATG, so the coding strand matches the mRNA except T→U. So maybe the DNA sequence given is the coding strand (sense strand), so the mRNA is the same as the DNA, except T replaced by U. Wait, but normally, the DNA is complementary to the mRNA. Wait, the coding strand (the same strand as mRNA) or the template strand?
Wait, the gene is on the DNA's coding strand (the strand that is complementary to mRNA). So when the mRNA is made, it's complementary to the template strand, so the coding strand is the same as mRNA (except T replaced by U). So if the DNA is given as 5'-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT ATT TGT CGT...TGA-3', then the mRNA would be 5'-AUG UUU CUU CGA GGU ACU UCU GUG GAU GAA CAU AUU AUU UGU CGU...UAA-3'
Wait, but maybe the DNA is the coding strand, so the mRNA is identical except T→U. So the original mRNA would be:
Start with AUG (Met), followed by UUU (Phe), CUU (Leu), CGA (Arg), GGU (Gly), ACU (Thr), UCU (Ser), GUG (Val), GAU (Asp), GAA (Glu), CAU (His), AUU (Ile), AUU (Ile), UGU (Cys), CGU (Arg), ... UAA (stop).

3.2: A frameshift mutation would require the insertion or deletion of nucleotides. Comparing the DNA sequences, Mutant 3's DNA is ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...TGA. The original DNA was ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...TGA. The differences between the original and Mutant 3 are as follows: Positions 4-6 in the original are TTT, while in Mutant 3 they are TTT as well, so no change. Positions 7-9 in the original are CTC GCT (converted from original DNA: after ATG, TTT CTC GCT...). Wait, perhaps a better way is to look at the codons.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
Mutant 3 does not introduce a stop codon in the first 20 amino acids. Mutant 3's DNA sequence shows a T to G change at position 7, potentially altering the codon from CTC (Leu) to CGT (Arg), but this is a missense mutation, not a frameshift.

4: Mutant 4's sequence is ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...TGA. Comparing it to the intact gene, the change is from GCTGGTACTT to GCTACTT. The difference is the removal of a GTT sequence. This suggests a deletion of nucleotides. Specifically, the original sequence GCTGGTACTT (positions 12-19) becomes GCTACTT (positions 12-17), indicating a deletion of the GTT (positions 15-17) from the original sequence. This deletion spans nucleotides 15-17 (positions 3-5 in the second codon of the original sequence). The original sequence after the start codon is TTT (positions 4-6), followed by CTG (positions 7-9), GGT (positions 10-12), and so on. The deletion of GTT (positions 15-17, which is part of the third codon) alters the reading frame. The original codons starting from the start site are TTT (Phe), CTG (Leu), GGT (Gly), and so on. After the deletion of GTT (positions 15-17, part of the third codon), the remaining sequence after the deletion is from position 18 onwards. The deletion of GTT from the third codon (GGT) would result in the remaining part of that codon being GT. This GT would then combine with the next nucleotides to form a new codon. The exact nature of the frame shift depends on the starting point. The start codon is ATG (positions 1-3). The first codon after the start is TTT (positions 4-6, Phe). The second codon is CTG (positions 7-9, Leu). The third codon is GGT (positions 10-12, Gly). The fourth codon is ACT (positions 13-15, Thr). The fifth codon is TCT (positions 16-18, Ser). The deletion in Mutant 4 occurs at nucleotides 15-17 (positions 15-17 of the original sequence, which is part of the fifth codon, TCT). The specific sequence change in Mutant 4 is from GCTGGTACTT (positions 12-19) to GCTACTT (positions 12-17). This change represents a deletion of the GTT sequence (nucleotides 15-17: G, T, T). This deletion removes three nucleotides (GTT) from positions 15-17 of the original sequence. The deletion of three nucleotides (GTT) would result in a frameshift mutation. The original sequence after the start codon is ATG (1-3), TTT (4-6), CTG (7-9), GGT (10-12), ACT (13-15), TCT (16-18), GGA (19-21), etc. After the deletion of nucleotides 15-17 (ACT becomes ACT minus T, i.e., AC, and the T from position 18 is now part of a new codon). The exact sequence after the deletion is more clearly seen by comparing the original and mutant sequences.
The original sequence from position 1-21 is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...
The mutant 4 sequence is ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT... The alignment shows that after position 12 (C in GCT), the original sequence had GCTGGTACTT... Mutant 4 has GCTACTTCTG... This indicates that "GGTACTT" in the original (positions 15-21) is changed to "ACTT" in the mutant. This corresponds to a deletion of "GGT" (positions 15-17), which are replaced by "AC" from the remaining sequence. This interpretation is not precise. A more accurate comparison shows the original sequence from position 12 onwards is GCTGGTACTTCTG... Mutant 4 has from position 12 onwards: GCTACTTCTG... This implies that the original "GGTAC" (positions 15-19) is changed to "AC" in the mutant, suggesting a deletion of "GTAC" (4 nucleotides). This interpretation is conflicting. A careful character-by-character comparison is needed. Original sequence starting at position 1: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT... (1-30) Mutant 4 sequence: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT... (1-?) The difference starts at position 12. Original: Position 12 is G (of GCTGGTACTT...). Mutant 4: Position 12 is C (of GCTACTT...). Wait, no. Let's look at the sequences again. Original (starting at 1): 1-5: ATGTT 6-10: TCTC 11-15: GCTGG 16-20: TACTT 21-25: CTGtg 26-30: gatgaa  etc. Mutant 4: The sequence after the start is TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT... Wait, maybe the numbering is different. Let's re-examine the sequences. The intact gene starts with ATG (1-3), then TTT (4-6), CTC (7-9), GCT (10-12), GGT (13-15), ACT (16-18), TCT (19-21), GTG (22-24), GGA (25-27), TGA (28-30). So the first exon is at least up to the first intron, but since it's a gene with five exons, the first exon might be longer or shorter. However, the mutations are all in the beginning of the first exon. Now, Mutant 4's sequence is given as ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...TGA. Comparing to the original: Original: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT... Mutant 4: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT... The difference is between "TTTCTCGCTGGTACTT" (original) and "TTTACGCTACTT" (mutant) starting after the ATG. Wait, maybe there was a deletion. Original after ATGTT: TCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT... Mutant 4 after ATGTT: TTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT... Hmm. So the original has TCTCGCTGGTACTT..., while mutant 4 has TTTACGCTACTTCTG... So between TCTCGCTGGTACT and TTTACGCTACTT, what's the difference? Wait, maybe the start is different. Wait, original sequence after ATG (start codon) is TTT (codon 2), CTC (codon 3), GCT (codon 4), GGT (codon 5), ACT (codon 6), TCT (codon7), GTG (codon8), GGA (codon9), etc. Mutant 4's sequence after ATG is TTT (codon2), TAC (codon3), GCT (codon4), ACT (codon5), TTC (codon6), TGT (codon7), GGA (codon8), etc. Wait, maybe the sequence in Mutant4 is different. Let me realign. Original: ATG | TTT | CTC | GCT | GGT | ACT | TCT | GTG | GGA | ... (Each codon is separated) Mutant4: ATG | TTT | TAC | GCT | ACT | TTC | TGT | GGA | ... So the key difference is that after the second codon (TTT), the next codons are altered. The original has CTC (codon3), GCT (codon4), GGT (codon5), etc. Mutant4 has TAC (codon3), GCT (codon4), ACT (codon5), TTC (codon6), TGT (codon7), etc. Therefore, the mutation in Mutant4 must have introduced a nonsense or changed the reading frame. Wait, but how? Let's check the nucleotide sequence. Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GGA ... Mutant4: ATG TTT_TAC GCT ACT TTC TGT GGA ... Wait, maybe there was an insertion or deletion. Wait, the original codons after ATG are: 1. ATG (start) 2. TTT (Phe) 3. CTC (Leu) 4. GCT (Ala) 5. GGT (Gly) 6. ACT (Thr) 7. TCT (Ser) 8. GTG (Val) 9. GGA (Gly) ... Mutant4's codons after ATG are: 1. ATG (start) 2. TTT (Phe) 3. TAC (Tyr) 4. GCT (Ala) 5. ACT (Thr) 6. TTC (Phe) 7. TGT (Cys) 8. GGA (Gly) ... So in Mutant4, codon3 is TAC instead of CTC. How did that happen? Looking at the nucleotides: Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT ... (positions 1-21) That is, position 1-3: ATG, 4-6: TTT, 7-9: CTC, 10-12: GCT, 13-15: GGT, 16-18: ACT, 19-21: TCT, etc. In Mutant4, after ATG TTT, the next codon is TAC (T at position 10, A at position 11, C at position 12). Wait, but in the original sequence, positions 7-9 are CTC (codon3), 10-12 are GCT (codon4), 13-15 are GGT (codon5). In Mutant4, codon3 is TAC, which would be positions 7-9: T, A, C. But the original sequence at positions 7-9 is CTC. Wait, so if in Mutant4, positions 7-9 are TAC instead of CTC, that's a change. But the mutant4 sequence given is ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT... So after ATG (1-3), TTT (4-6), TAC (7-9), GCT (10-12), ACT (13-15), TTC (16-18), TGT (19-21), etc. Compared to original: ATG (1-3), TTT (4-6), CTC (7-9), GCT (10-12), GGT (13-15), ACT (16-18), TCT (19-21), etc. Therefore, in Mutant4, positions 7-9 are TAC instead of CTC. That's a point mutation changing CTC to TAC. So nucleotides 7-9 are mutated from C to T, T to A, and C to C (wait no, original is CTC, mutant is TAC). Wait, original at positions 7 is C, 8 is T, 9 is C. In mutant4, positions 7 is T, 8 is A, 9 is C. So it's a mutation from CTC to TAC. That would require two nucleotide changes: position 7 from C to T, position 8 from T to A. But EMS is typically a point mutagen, causing G:C to A:T transitions or A:T to G:C transversions, but usually single nucleotide changes. Wait, but in this case, if positions 7,8,9 are changed from CTC to TAC, that's two mutations (position7 C>T and position8 T>A), but EMS usually induces G:C to A:T substitutions. Unless there was a dinucleotide mutation, but that's uncommon with EMS. However, the problem states that they sequenced the gene and found changes, so maybe more than one nucleotide change is possible, but the question says "produce a collection of mutants using EMS chemical mutagen." EMS typically causes point mutations. So maybe the scenario here is that each mutant has a single point mutation. However, looking at the sequences, some of the mutants have changes that could be a result of single nucleotide changes. Let's check again. For Mutant4, the original sequence from 7-9 is CTC, mutant4 has TAC. That's a change of C7 to T, T8 to A, but C9 is the same. So that would actually require two separate substitutions, which is unlikely for EMS. Therefore, maybe Mutant4's sequence is different. Alternatively, perhaps there was a deletion or insertion. Wait, the original sequence is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT... In Mutant4, it's ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT... So after ATGTTT (positions 1-6), the original has CTC GCT GGT ACT (positions 7-18), but Mutant4 has TAC GCT ACT (positions 7-15). So the original from 7-18 is CTC GCT GGT ACT (which is 7-18, codons 3-6), while Mutant4 has 7-9: TAC, 10-12: GCT, 13-15: ACT. So the sequence starting at position 7 in original: CTC GCT GGT ACT (7-18), while mutant4 has TAC GCT ACT (7-15). So the length is different. The original is 12 nucleotides (7-18) and mutant4 is 9 nucleotides (7-15). That suggests a deletion of 3 nucleotides. So after position 7, instead of CTC GCT GGT ACT (which is 12 nt), the mutant has TAC GCT ACT (9 nt). So from position 7, original: 7-9: CTC, 10-12: GCT, 13-15: GGT, 16-18: ACT. Mutant4: 7-9: TAC, 10-12: GCT, 13-15: ACT. So positions 10-12 in both are GCT, but in the original, positions 13-15 are GGT, while in mutant4, 13-15 are ACT. So somehow GGT is changed to ACT. Wait, perhaps there was a 3 nucleotide deletion from positions 13-15 (GGT), so that after position 12 (T of GCT), the next nucleotides are ACT. But in the mutant4 sequence, after GCT (positions 10-12), the next codon is ACT (13-15). So if the original had GGT at 13-15, but mutant4 has ACT. That would suggest a deletion of GGT and insertion of ACT? Wait, but that's unclear. Alternatively, maybe the original sequence had a duplication or insertion in the mutant4. Wait, looking at the sequences again: Original: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT... (from position 1) Breakdown: ATG (1-3), TTT (4-6), CTC (7-9), GCT (10-12), GGT (13-15), ACT (16-18), TCT (19-21), GTG (22-24), GGA (25-27), TGA (28-30). Mutant4: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT... (from position 1) Breakdown: ATG (1-3), TTT (4-6), TAC (7-9), GCT (10-12), ACT (13-15), TTC (16-18), TGT (19-21), GGA (22-24), etc. Comparing the two sequences: Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GGA ... Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TTC TGT GGA ... So the key differences start at codon3: Original has CTC (Leu), mutant4 has TAC (Tyr). Then codon4 is GCT (Ala) in both. Codon5: original is GGT (Gly), mutant4 is ACT (Thr). Codon6: original is ACT (Thr), mutant4 is TTC (Phe). Codon7: original is TCT (Ser), mutant4 is TGT (Cys). Codon8: original is GTG (Val), mutant4 is GGA (Gly). So this seems to be a different amino acid sequence starting from codon3. But how was this achieved? If EMS is a point mutagen, then each codon difference would be a single nucleotide change. Let's check: Codon3: CTC → TAC. What kind of mutation is that? Nucleotide positions 7-9: C T C → T A C. So: Position 7: C → T (G in the complementary strand → A?) Wait, but EMS causes mutations such as G:C pairs to A:T. If the original codon is CTC (the strand shown is the coding strand), then the complementary strand would be GAG. If EMS methylates the N7 of guanine, leading to a G→A mutation in the complementary strand. Wait, but this is complicated. Let's think in terms of the coding strand. If the mutation in the coding strand from C to T would require the original being a G•C pair (in the coding and complementary strands) becoming a T•A. But the coding strand is the one that is transcribed into mRNA (with T replaced by U). Wait, perhaps I need to clarify the DNA strands. The gene sequence provided is the coding strand (same as mRNA except T→U). So if the gene is given as 5'-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...TGA-3', then the mRNA would be the same as the coding strand (except T→U). If there's a point mutation in the coding strand, say from C to T at position 7, that would change the mRNA and subsequently the protein. But in Mutant4, codon3 is TAC, which would require positions 7-9 to be TAC. So comparing to original CTC, this is: Position 7: C→T Position 8: T→A Position 9: C→C (no change) But EMS would typically cause a specific type of mutation. If the original DNA is: Coding strand: ... T G T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G T ... | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

okay, let's see. so the problem is about finding which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in a drought-resistant barley cultivar. the gene responsible for the compound has five exons and four introns. they used ems mutagenesis and sequenced the first exon area. we need to look at the mutations in the first exon and figure out which one would likely eliminate the compound.
first, let's remember that ems (ethyl methanesulfonate) is a mutagen that typically causes point mutations, usually by alkylating dna bases, often leading to base pair substitutions. so each mutant here probably has a single nucleotide change, but i need to check the sequences to confirm.
the intact gene's sequence starts with atg (which is the start codon, so that's important). then the rest is the coding sequence. the mutations are all in the first exon. let's align each mutant sequence with the wild type to see what changed.
let's think in parallel.

1: mutant 1's sequence is compared to the intact gene. the intact sequence is 5'-atgtttctcgctggtacttctgtggatgaacatatttattgtcgt...tga-3'. mutant 1's sequence is 5'-atgttctacgctggtacttctgtggatgaacatatttattgtcgc...tga-3'. the differences are identified by aligning the sequences.
mutant 1: atgtttctcgctggtacttctgtggatgaacatatttattgtcgt...
wild type: atgtttctcgctggtacttctgtggatgaacatatttattgtcgt...
the initial comparison suggests no difference.
a recheck is performed.
the sequences are re-aligned.
mutant 1: atg-ttt-ctc-gct-ggt-ac... (dashes added for separation)
wild type: atg-ttt-ctc-gct-ggt-ac... (dashes added for separation)
the first six nucleotides (atgttt) match.
the next three nucleotides (ctc) match.
the next four nucleotides (gcgt) in the wild type are compared to mutant 1's sequence.
the mutant sequence is examined after "atgtttctcgctggtac".
the mutant sequence following "atgtttctcgctggtac" is "ttctgtggatgaacatatttattgtcgc...".
the wild-type sequence after "atgtttctcgctggtac" is "ttctgtggatgaacatatttattgtcgt...".
the sequences diverge at the 27th nucleotide position.
the mutant's 27th nucleotide is c, while the wild-type's is t.
the 27th nucleotide in the wild type is t, which is replaced by c in mutant 1.
the mutation is t to c at position 27.
the codon context is considered.
the first codon is atg (met).
the next codon is ttt (phe).
the third codon is ctc (leu).
the fourth codon is gcg (ala).
the fifth codon is tgg (trp).
the sixth codon is tac (tyr) in mutant 1 versus tat (tyr) in the wild type.
the mutation is identified as t27c, changing tat to tac.
the codon change tat (tyr) to tac (tyr) is noted.
the amino acid remains tyrosine.
the t27c mutation does not alter the amino acid sequence.
mutant 1's mutation results in a synonymous substitution.

2: the sequence of mutant 2 is atgttctaagctggtacttctgtggatgaacatatttattgtcgc...tga. comparing this with the intact gene, the first difference is observed at position 7, where a t (from the intact gene) is replaced by an a in mutant 2. this is the first change.
the next comparison between positions 8 and 9 shows the intact gene has a c, while mutant 2 has a c, indicating no change here.
at positions 10 and 11, the intact gene has a g, while mutant 2 also has a g, showing no change.
at positions 12 and 13, the intact gene has a t, while mutant 2 has a t, showing no change.
at positions 14 and 15, the intact gene has a c, while mutant 2 also has a c, showing no change.
the next comparison at positions 16 and 17 shows the intact gene has a t, while mutant 2 has an a, indicating a t to a substitution.
therefore, mutant 2 has two point mutations: a t to a substitution at position 7, and a t to a substitution at position 16.

3: mutant 3's sequence is atgttttacgctggtgtcacttctgtggatgaacatatttattgtcgt...tga. comparing to the wild type, the third position after atg is t instead of t (no change), fourth is t instead of t (no change), fifth is t instead of t (no change). wait, let's look again. wait, the original sequence after atg is tttctcgc. wait, wait:
original: atg ttt ctc gct ggt act tct gtg gat gaa cat att att tgt cgt ... tga
but wait, perhaps it's easier to convert the dna sequence into mrna and then to amino acids. since the sequence is given as dna (5' to 3'), mrna is complementary, so for the coding strand, the mrna would be complementary to the dna's non-coding strand. but maybe an easier way is to transcribe the dna into mrna (replace t with u) and then translate.
but maybe the key is to find a mutation that introduces a stop codon early (nonsense mutation) or a frameshift, which would truncate the protein and possibly eliminate the anti-nutritional compound's production.
let's think in parallel.

3.1: let's check each mutant for such changes.
starting with mutant 1:
original dna: atg ttt ctc gct ggt act tct gtg gat gaa cat att att tgt cgt ... tga
mutant 1 dna: atg t <u>tc</u> tac gct ggt act tct gtg gat gaa cat att att tgt cgc ...
so the change is from ctc to tac (at position 3-6 maybe?). wait, let me align them properly:
original: atg ttt ctc gct ggt act tct gtg gat gaa cat att att tgt cgt ... tga
mutant1: atg t (original: c, mutant1: t) so the third base in the second codon (original: ttt (f), ctc (l)) becomes tt<u>t</u> (still ttt, so same codon? wait, no. wait, let's break down.
wait, maybe i should transcribe and translate each mutant.
original dna: 5'-atg ttt ctc gct ggt act tct gtg gat gaa cat att att tgt cgt...tga-3'
the mrna would be the complementary sequence of the dna (since dna is the coding strand?), so the mrna would be:
5'-aug uuu cuu cga ggu acu ucu gug gau gaa cau auu auu ugu cgu...uaa-3'
wait, but dna is given as the coding strand (since atg is start codon, so in the dna it's written as atg, so the coding strand matches the mrna except t→u. so maybe the dna sequence given is the coding strand (sense strand), so the mrna is the same as the dna, except t replaced by u. wait, but normally, the dna is complementary to the mrna. wait, the coding strand (the same strand as mrna) or the template strand?
wait, the gene is on the dna's coding strand (the strand that is complementary to mrna). so when the mrna is made, it's complementary to the template strand, so the coding strand is the same as mrna (except t replaced by u). so if the dna is given as 5'-atg ttt ctc gct ggt act tct gtg gat gaa cat att att tgt cgt...tga-3', then the mrna would be 5'-aug uuu cuu cga ggu acu ucu gug gau gaa cau auu auu ugu cgu...uaa-3'
wait, but maybe the dna is the coding strand, so the mrna is identical except t→u. so the original mrna would be:
start with aug (met), followed by uuu (phe), cuu (leu), cga (arg), ggu (gly), acu (thr), ucu (ser), gug (val), gau (asp), gaa (glu), cau (his), auu (ile), auu (ile), ugu (cys), cgu (arg), ... uaa (stop).

3.2: a frameshift mutation would require the insertion or deletion of nucleotides. comparing the dna sequences, mutant 3's dna is atgttttacgctggtgtcacttctgtggatgaacatatttattgtcgt...tga. the original dna was atgtttctcgctggtacttctgtggatgaacatatttattgtcgt...tga. the differences between the original and mutant 3 are as follows: positions 4-6 in the original are ttt, while in mutant 3 they are ttt as well, so no change. positions 7-9 in the original are ctc gct (converted from original dna: after atg, ttt ctc gct...). wait, perhaps a better way is to look at the codons.
</path>
<conclusion>
mutant 3 does not introduce a stop codon in the first 20 amino acids. mutant 3's dna sequence shows a t to g change at position 7, potentially altering the codon from ctc (leu) to cgt (arg), but this is a missense mutation, not a frameshift.

4: mutant 4's sequence is atgttttacgctacttctgtggatgaacatatttattgtcgt...tga. comparing it to the intact gene, the change is from gctggtactt to gctactt. the difference is the removal of a gtt sequence. this suggests a deletion of nucleotides. specifically, the original sequence gctggtactt (positions 12-19) becomes gctactt (positions 12-17), indicating a deletion of the gtt (positions 15-17) from the original sequence. this deletion spans nucleotides 15-17 (positions 3-5 in the second codon of the original sequence). the original sequence after the start codon is ttt (positions 4-6), followed by ctg (positions 7-9), ggt (positions 10-12), and so on. the deletion of gtt (positions 15-17, which is part of the third codon) alters the reading frame. the original codons starting from the start site are ttt (phe), ctg (leu), ggt (gly), and so on. after the deletion of gtt (positions 15-17, part of the third codon), the remaining sequence after the deletion is from position 18 onwards. the deletion of gtt from the third codon (ggt) would result in the remaining part of that codon being gt. this gt would then combine with the next nucleotides to form a new codon. the exact nature of the frame shift depends on the starting point. the start codon is atg (positions 1-3). the first codon after the start is ttt (positions 4-6, phe). the second codon is ctg (positions 7-9, leu). the third codon is ggt (positions 10-12, gly). the fourth codon is act (positions 13-15, thr). the fifth codon is tct (positions 16-18, ser). the deletion in mutant 4 occurs at nucleotides 15-17 (positions 15-17 of the original sequence, which is part of the fifth codon, tct). the specific sequence change in mutant 4 is from gctggtactt (positions 12-19) to gctactt (positions 12-17). this change represents a deletion of the gtt sequence (nucleotides 15-17: g, t, t). this deletion removes three nucleotides (gtt) from positions 15-17 of the original sequence. the deletion of three nucleotides (gtt) would result in a frameshift mutation. the original sequence after the start codon is atg (1-3), ttt (4-6), ctg (7-9), ggt (10-12), act (13-15), tct (16-18), gga (19-21), etc. after the deletion of nucleotides 15-17 (act becomes act minus t, i.e., ac, and the t from position 18 is now part of a new codon). the exact sequence after the deletion is more clearly seen by comparing the original and mutant sequences.
the original sequence from position 1-21 is atgtttctcgctggtacttctgtggatgaacatatttattgtcgt...
the mutant 4 sequence is atgttttacgctacttctgtggatgaacatatttattgtcgt... the alignment shows that after position 12 (c in gct), the original sequence had gctggtactt... mutant 4 has gctacttctg... this indicates that "ggtactt" in the original (positions 15-21) is changed to "actt" in the mutant. this corresponds to a deletion of "ggt" (positions 15-17), which are replaced by "ac" from the remaining sequence. this interpretation is not precise. a more accurate comparison shows the original sequence from position 12 onwards is gctggtacttctg... mutant 4 has from position 12 onwards: gctacttctg... this implies that the original "ggtac" (positions 15-19) is changed to "ac" in the mutant, suggesting a deletion of "gtac" (4 nucleotides). this interpretation is conflicting. a careful character-by-character comparison is needed. original sequence starting at position 1: atgtttctcgctggtacttctgtggatgaacatatttattgtcgt... (1-30) mutant 4 sequence: atgttttacgctacttctgtggatgaacatatttattgtcgt... (1-?) the difference starts at position 12. original: position 12 is g (of gctggtactt...). mutant 4: position 12 is c (of gctactt...). wait, no. let's look at the sequences again. original (starting at 1): 1-5: atgtt 6-10: tctc 11-15: gctgg 16-20: tactt 21-25: ctgtg 26-30: gatgaa  etc. mutant 4: the sequence after the start is ttttacgctacttctgtggatgaacatatttattgtcgt... wait, maybe the numbering is different. let's re-examine the sequences. the intact gene starts with atg (1-3), then ttt (4-6), ctc (7-9), gct (10-12), ggt (13-15), act (16-18), tct (19-21), gtg (22-24), gga (25-27), tga (28-30). so the first exon is at least up to the first intron, but since it's a gene with five exons, the first exon might be longer or shorter. however, the mutations are all in the beginning of the first exon. now, mutant 4's sequence is given as atgttttacgctacttctgtggatgaacatatttattgtcgt...tga. comparing to the original: original: atgtttctcgctggtacttctgtggatgaacatatttattgtcgt... mutant 4: atgttttacgctacttctgtggatgaacatatttattgtcgt... the difference is between "tttctcgctggtactt" (original) and "tttacgctactt" (mutant) starting after the atg. wait, maybe there was a deletion. original after atgtt: tctcgctggtacttctgtggatgaacatatttattgtcgt... mutant 4 after atgtt: tttacgctacttctgtggatgaacatatttattgtcgt... hmm. so the original has tctcgctggtactt..., while mutant 4 has tttacgctacttctg... so between tctcgctggtact and tttacgctactt, what's the difference? wait, maybe the start is different. wait, original sequence after atg (start codon) is ttt (codon 2), ctc (codon 3), gct (codon 4), ggt (codon 5), act (codon 6), tct (codon7), gtg (codon8), gga (codon9), etc. mutant 4's sequence after atg is ttt (codon2), tac (codon3), gct (codon4), act (codon5), ttc (codon6), tgt (codon7), gga (codon8), etc. wait, maybe the sequence in mutant4 is different. let me realign. original: atg | ttt | ctc | gct | ggt | act | tct | gtg | gga | ... (each codon is separated) mutant4: atg | ttt | tac | gct | act | ttc | tgt | gga | ... so the key difference is that after the second codon (ttt), the next codons are altered. the original has ctc (codon3), gct (codon4), ggt (codon5), etc. mutant4 has tac (codon3), gct (codon4), act (codon5), ttc (codon6), tgt (codon7), etc. therefore, the mutation in mutant4 must have introduced a nonsense or changed the reading frame. wait, but how? let's check the nucleotide sequence. original: atg ttt ctc gct ggt act tct gtg gga ... mutant4: atg ttt_tac gct act ttc tgt gga ... wait, maybe there was an insertion or deletion. wait, the original codons after atg are: 1. atg (start) 2. ttt (phe) 3. ctc (leu) 4. gct (ala) 5. ggt (gly) 6. act (thr) 7. tct (ser) 8. gtg (val) 9. gga (gly) ... mutant4's codons after atg are: 1. atg (start) 2. ttt (phe) 3. tac (tyr) 4. gct (ala) 5. act (thr) 6. ttc (phe) 7. tgt (cys) 8. gga (gly) ... so in mutant4, codon3 is tac instead of ctc. how did that happen? looking at the nucleotides: original: atg ttt ctc gct ggt act tct ... (positions 1-21) that is, position 1-3: atg, 4-6: ttt, 7-9: ctc, 10-12: gct, 13-15: ggt, 16-18: act, 19-21: tct, etc. in mutant4, after atg ttt, the next codon is tac (t at position 10, a at position 11, c at position 12). wait, but in the original sequence, positions 7-9 are ctc (codon3), 10-12 are gct (codon4), 13-15 are ggt (codon5). in mutant4, codon3 is tac, which would be positions 7-9: t, a, c. but the original sequence at positions 7-9 is ctc. wait, so if in mutant4, positions 7-9 are tac instead of ctc, that's a change. but the mutant4 sequence given is atgttttacgctacttctgtggatgaacatatttattgtcgt... so after atg (1-3), ttt (4-6), tac (7-9), gct (10-12), act (13-15), ttc (16-18), tgt (19-21), etc. compared to original: atg (1-3), ttt (4-6), ctc (7-9), gct (10-12), ggt (13-15), act (16-18), tct (19-21), etc. therefore, in mutant4, positions 7-9 are tac instead of ctc. that's a point mutation changing ctc to tac. so nucleotides 7-9 are mutated from c to t, t to a, and c to c (wait no, original is ctc, mutant is tac). wait, original at positions 7 is c, 8 is t, 9 is c. in mutant4, positions 7 is t, 8 is a, 9 is c. so it's a mutation from ctc to tac. that would require two nucleotide changes: position 7 from c to t, position 8 from t to a. but ems is typically a point mutagen, causing g:c to a:t transitions or a:t to g:c transversions, but usually single nucleotide changes. wait, but in this case, if positions 7,8,9 are changed from ctc to tac, that's two mutations (position7 c>t and position8 t>a), but ems usually induces g:c to a:t substitutions. unless there was a dinucleotide mutation, but that's uncommon with ems. however, the problem states that they sequenced the gene and found changes, so maybe more than one nucleotide change is possible, but the question says "produce a collection of mutants using ems chemical mutagen." ems typically causes point mutations. so maybe the scenario here is that each mutant has a single point mutation. however, looking at the sequences, some of the mutants have changes that could be a result of single nucleotide changes. let's check again. for mutant4, the original sequence from 7-9 is ctc, mutant4 has tac. that's a change of c7 to t, t8 to a, but c9 is the same. so that would actually require two separate substitutions, which is unlikely for ems. therefore, maybe mutant4's sequence is different. alternatively, perhaps there was a deletion or insertion. wait, the original sequence is atgtttctcgctggtacttctgtggatgaacatatttattgtcgt... in mutant4, it's atgttttacgctacttctgtggatgaacatatttattgtcgt... so after atgttt (positions 1-6), the original has ctc gct ggt act (positions 7-18), but mutant4 has tac gct act (positions 7-15). so the original from 7-18 is ctc gct ggt act (which is 7-18, codons 3-6), while mutant4 has 7-9: tac, 10-12: gct, 13-15: act. so the sequence starting at position 7 in original: ctc gct ggt act (7-18), while mutant4 has tac gct act (7-15). so the length is different. the original is 12 nucleotides (7-18) and mutant4 is 9 nucleotides (7-15). that suggests a deletion of 3 nucleotides. so after position 7, instead of ctc gct ggt act (which is 12 nt), the mutant has tac gct act (9 nt). so from position 7, original: 7-9: ctc, 10-12: gct, 13-15: ggt, 16-18: act. mutant4: 7-9: tac, 10-12: gct, 13-15: act. so positions 10-12 in both are gct, but in the original, positions 13-15 are ggt, while in mutant4, 13-15 are act. so somehow ggt is changed to act. wait, perhaps there was a 3 nucleotide deletion from positions 13-15 (ggt), so that after position 12 (t of gct), the next nucleotides are act. but in the mutant4 sequence, after gct (positions 10-12), the next codon is act (13-15). so if the original had ggt at 13-15, but mutant4 has act. that would suggest a deletion of ggt and insertion of act? wait, but that's unclear. alternatively, maybe the original sequence had a duplication or insertion in the mutant4. wait, looking at the sequences again: original: atgtttctcgctggtacttctgtggatgaacatatttattgtcgt... (from position 1) breakdown: atg (1-3), ttt (4-6), ctc (7-9), gct (10-12), ggt (13-15), act (16-18), tct (19-21), gtg (22-24), gga (25-27), tga (28-30). mutant4: atgttttacgctacttctgtggatgaacatatttattgtcgt... (from position 1) breakdown: atg (1-3), ttt (4-6), tac (7-9), gct (10-12), act (13-15), ttc (16-18), tgt (19-21), gga (22-24), etc. comparing the two sequences: original: atg ttt ctc gct ggt act tct gtg gga ... mutant4: atg ttt tac gct act ttc tgt gga ... so the key differences start at codon3: original has ctc (leu), mutant4 has tac (tyr). then codon4 is gct (ala) in both. codon5: original is ggt (gly), mutant4 is act (thr). codon6: original is act (thr), mutant4 is ttc (phe). codon7: original is tct (ser), mutant4 is tgt (cys). codon8: original is gtg (val), mutant4 is gga (gly). so this seems to be a different amino acid sequence starting from codon3. but how was this achieved? if ems is a point mutagen, then each codon difference would be a single nucleotide change. let's check: codon3: ctc → tac. what kind of mutation is that? nucleotide positions 7-9: c t c → t a c. so: position 7: c → t (g in the complementary strand → a?) wait, but ems causes mutations such as g:c pairs to a:t. if the original codon is ctc (the strand shown is the coding strand), then the complementary strand would be gag. if ems methylates the n7 of guanine, leading to a g→a mutation in the complementary strand. wait, but this is complicated. let's think in terms of the coding strand. if the mutation in the coding strand from c to t would require the original being a g•c pair (in the coding and complementary strands) becoming a t•a. but the coding strand is the one that is transcribed into mrna (with t replaced by u). wait, perhaps i need to clarify the dna strands. the gene sequence provided is the coding strand (same as mrna except t→u). so if the gene is given as 5'-atgtttctcgctggtacttctgtggatgaacatatttattgtcgt...tga-3', then the mrna would be the same as the coding strand (except t→u). if there's a point mutation in the coding strand, say from c to t at position 7, that would change the mrna and subsequently the protein. but in mutant4, codon3 is tac, which would require positions 7-9 to be tac. so comparing to original ctc, this is: position 7: c→t position 8: t→a position 9: c→c (no change) but ems would typically cause a specific type of mutation. if the original dna is: coding strand: ... t g t t t c t c g c t g g t a c t t c t g t g g a t g a a c a t a t t t a t t g t c g t ... | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
