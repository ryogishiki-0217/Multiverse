Okay, so I need to figure out the pH when three solutions are mixed together: 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide [Ba(OH)2]. Hmm. Let me start by recalling what I know about pH calculations when acids and bases are mixed. First, strong acids and strong bases will completely dissociate in water, while weak acids, like acetic acid, only partially dissociate. The HCl is a strong acid, so it will fully donate protons (H+), and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base—it's a group 2 hydroxide, so it should fully dissociate into Ba2+ and 2 OH− ions. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it will have some H+ contribution, but most of it will remain as CH3COOH molecules. The challenge here is to find the resultant pH after mixing all three. The steps I think I need to follow are: 1. Calculate the moles of H+ from each acid (HCl and acetic acid). Wait, but since Ba(OH)2 is a base, it will contribute OH− ions. Then, when these solutions are mixed, the H+ and OH− ions will neutralize each other. So, first, compute the total moles of H+ from HCl and acetic acid, considering that HCl is strong, so all of its moles contribute to H+, and acetic acid is weak, so only a portion does. But wait, actually for the weak acid, maybe I need to calculate the amount that dissociates using its Ka? Wait, but acetic acid's Ka is about 1.8x10^-5. That's pretty small, meaning only a small fraction dissociates. However, when you mix a weak acid with a strong base, the strong base will deprotonate the weak acid. Wait, but in this case, we have both a strong acid (HCl) and a strong base (Ba(OH)2). So, the HCl and Ba(OH)2 are going to neutralize each other first, right? But then also, the Ba(OH)2 might deprotonate the acetic acid? Hmm. Wait, let's take this step by step. First, calculate the moles of each component. Let's start with HCl: Volume is 400 mL = 0.4 L Concentration is 0.2 M, so moles of HCl = 0.4 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.08 mol. Since HCl is strong, this gives 0.08 mol H+.
Next, Ba(OH)2: Volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L Concentration is 0.3 M, so moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol. But each Ba(OH)2 dissociates into 1 Ba2+ and 2 OH−, so moles of OH− = 2 * 0.09 = 0.18 mol.
Acetic acid (CH3COOH): Volume is 500 mL = 0.5 L Concentration is 0.1 M, so moles of CH3COOH = 0.5 L * 0.1 mol/L = 0.05 mol. Now, when all these are mixed, the H+ ions from HCl and the OH− ions from Ba(OH)2 will neutralize each other. So, let's calculate the total H+ and OH− before mixing: Total H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol Total OH− from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 mol Acetic acid is a weak acid, so in solution, it's in equilibrium with H+ and CH3COO−. But when mixed with the strong base, some of the acetic acid may be deprotonated. Wait, but the strong base (OH−) is in excess here? Let me check. Total H+ before mixing is 0.08 mol. Total OH− is 0.18 mol. If we mix them, they'll react in a 1:1 molar ratio: H+ + OH− → H2O So, the OH− will neutralize 0.08 mol H+, and there will be 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol OH− remaining. But wait, but we also have acetic acid present. So perhaps the remaining OH− will react with the acetic acid? Acetic acid's conjugate base is CH3COO−. The reaction would be: CH3COOH + OH− → CH3COO− + H2O But this is an acid-base reaction where OH− deprotonates acetic acid. The number of moles of OH− remaining after neutralizing the HCl's H+ is 0.10 mol. The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.05 mol. So, if we add 0.10 mol OH− to 0.05 mol CH3COOH, how does this reaction go? The OH− will abstract protons from the acetic acid. The amount of CH3COOH that reacts is equal to the moles of OH− added, up to the amount of CH3COOH present. Wait, but here we have 0.10 mol OH− and only 0.05 mol CH3COOH. So, all of the acetic acid will react, and there will still be 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol OH− left over. Wait, but let me confirm: The OH− will react with the acetic acid in a 1:1 molar ratio (since each OH− deprotonates one CH3COOH). If there's 0.10 mol OH− and 0.05 mol CH3COOH, then they'll consume all 0.05 mol of CH3COOH and 0.05 mol of OH−, leaving 0.05 mol OH− unreacted. Is that right? Yes. So, the reaction is: CH3COOH + OH− → CH3COO− + H2O Moles reacted: 0.05 mol (all of the CH3COOH) Therefore, moles of CH3COO− formed = 0.05 mol. And the remaining OH− is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol. Therefore, after all reactions, we have: - 0.05 mol CH3COO− - 0.05 mol OH− from the excess base. Now, we have to find the total volume of the solution. The total volume is 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L. So, the concentration of OH− is 0.05 mol / 1.2 L = 0.04167 M. Then, pOH = -log[OH−] = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38. Therefore, pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62. Wait, but one of the options is 12.62 (option C). But hold on, let me check again. Wait, but is this correct? Because when Ba(OH)2 is added, which is a strong base, and HCl is a strong acid, their moles would neutralize each other, and then the excess base would deprotonate the weak acid. But after that, the solution is basic, so the pH should be high. 12.62 is a basic pH, so that's possible. But let me go through the calculations step by step to make sure. First, calculating moles: HCl: 0.4 L * 0.2 M = 0.08 mol H+. Ba(OH)2: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2. Since each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH−, that's 0.18 mol OH−. CH3COOH: 0.5 L * 0.1 M = 0.05 mol. Then, mixing H+ and OH−: They react in a 1:1 ratio. The H+ is 0.08 mol and OH− is 0.18 mol. So, after reaction, remaining OH− is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol. Then, this 0.10 mol OH− is added to the acetic acid solution. The acetic acid is 0.05 mol. The reaction between OH− and CH3COOH is: CH3COOH + OH− → CH3COO− + H2O. Since we have 0.10 mol OH− and 0.05 mol CH3COOH, the limiting reagent is CH3COOH. So, 0.05 mol of OH− will react with 0.05 mol of CH3COOH to produce 0.05 mol CH3COO−, and the remaining OH− is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol. Therefore, after reaction, we have: - 0.05 mol CH3COO− - 0.05 mol OH−. Total volume is 0.5 + 0.4 + 0.3 = 1.2 L. So, [OH−] = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M. pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38. Therefore, pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62. So, the answer would be C) 12.62. But let me think again. Did I consider all the species? The acetate ion (CH3COO−) is the conjugate base of a weak acid, so in a basic solution, it might hydrolyze: CH3COO− + H2O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH−. But since the solution is already basic (we have excess OH−), maybe the hydrolysis is negligible? Wait, but maybe I need to perform a more precise calculation considering the hydrolysis of acetate? Wait, but in a solution with high OH− concentration, adding a weak base's conjugate ion might not hydrolyze much. The hydroxide concentration is 0.04167 M, which is pretty high. The acetate will hydrolyze according to the equation: CH3COO− + H2O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH− The equilibrium constant for this is Kb = Kw/Ka_acetic_acid. Let's see: Ka of acetic acid is 1.8x10^-5. So, Kb = 1.0x10^-14 / 1.8x10^-5 ≈ 5.56x10^-10. So, Kb is very small, which means the hydrolysis of acetate is negligible. Moreover, the solution already has a high OH− concentration. So, even if some acetate hydrolyzes, producing more OH− and acetic acid, but since the concentration of OH− is already high, the hydrolysis would be even less likely. Alternatively, perhaps I can do an ICE table? Let me see. The initial concentration of CH3COO− is 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M. The initial concentration of OH− is 0.04167 M. Let’s denote the hydrolysis reaction: CH3COO− + H2O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH− Initial concentrations: [CH3COO−] = 0.04167 M [CH3COOH] = 0 (since all acetic acid was deprotonated? Wait, no. Wait, after reaction, the initial moles of CH3COOH would be zero, because all 0.05 mol reacted to form CH3COO−. But then, when we consider hydrolysis, the CH3COO− would react to form CH3COOH and OH−. But the initial [OH−] from the excess base is also 0.04167 M. The Kb is 5.56x10^-10. Let S be the concentration of OH− increase due to hydrolysis. Then: [OH−] = 0.04167 + S ≈ 0.04167 M because S is very small. Similarly, [CH3COOH] = S [CH3COO−] = 0.04167 - S ≈ 0.04167 M Then, Kb = [CH3COOH][OH−] / [CH3COO−] ≈ (S)(0.04167) / 0.04167) = S. Therefore, S ≈ Kb = 5.56x10^-10. So the increase in OH− is negligible compared to the initial 0.04167 M. Therefore, the contribution of acetate hydrolysis to pH can be ignored. Therefore, the pH is determined primarily by the remaining OH− from the excess Ba(OH)2, after neutralizing HCl and reacting with acetic acid. Therefore, pH calculation as before is valid. Thus, the answer is C) 12.62. But let me check the answer choices again. The options are A) 8.68, B) 8.92, C) 12.62, D) 1.38. 12.62 is there, and since the solution is basic, that makes sense. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the process? Let's confirm: 1. Calculated moles: HCl: 0.08 mol H+ Ba(OH)2: 0.18 mol OH− CH3COOH: 0.05 mol. 2. Mix H+ and OH−: 0.08 mol H+ + 0.18 mol OH− → 0.10 mol OH− remaining. 3. This 0.10 mol OH− reacts with 0.05 mol CH3COOH → 0.05 mol CH3COO− and 0.05 mol OH− remaining. 4. Total volume: 1.2 L. 5. [OH−] = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L = 0.04167 M. 6. pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38, so pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62. That's correct. So, the answer is C. I think that's it.

Answer: To determine the pH of the solution containing 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2, we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate moles of each component:**
   - **HCl:** \(0.4 \, \text{L} \times 0.2 \, \text{M} = 0.08 \, \text{mol H}^+\)
   - **Ba(OH)2:** \(0.3 \, \text{L} \times 0.3 \, \text{M} = 0.09 \, \text{mol}\) Ba(OH)2, which provides \(0.18 \, \text{mol OH}^-\)
   - **CH3COOH:** \(0.5 \, \text{L} \times 0.1 \, \text{M} = 0.05 \, \text{mol}\)

2. **Neutralize H+ and OH−:**
   - H+ from HCl (0.08 mol) reacts with OH− from Ba(OH)2 (0.18 mol), leaving \(0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{mol OH}^-\).

3. **React remaining OH− with CH3COOH:**
   - OH− (0.10 mol) reacts with CH3COOH (0.05 mol) in a 1:1 ratio:
     - Products: 0.05 mol CH3COO− and 0.05 mol OH− remaining.

4. **Calculate OH− concentration in total volume (1.2 L):**
   - \([ \text{OH}^- ] = \frac{0.05 \, \text{mol}}{1.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.04167 \, \text{M}\)

5. **Determine pOH and pH:**
   - \( \text{pOH} = -\log(0.04167) \approx 1.38 \)
   - \( \text{pH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62 \)

The final answer is \boxed{C}

next, ba(oh)2: volume is 300 ml = 0.3 l concentration is 0.3 m, so moles of ba(oh)2 = 0.3 l * 0.3 mol/l = 0.09 mol. but each ba(oh)2 dissociates into 1 ba2+ and 2 oh−, so moles of oh− = 2 * 0.09 = 0.18 mol.
acetic acid (ch3cooh): volume is 500 ml = 0.5 l concentration is 0.1 m, so moles of ch3cooh = 0.5 l * 0.1 mol/l = 0.05 mol. now, when all these are mixed, the h+ ions from hcl and the oh− ions from ba(oh)2 will neutralize each other. so, let's calculate the total h+ and oh− before mixing: total h+ from hcl: 0.08 mol total oh− from ba(oh)2: 0.18 mol acetic acid is a weak acid, so in solution, it's in equilibrium with h+ and ch3coo−. but when mixed with the strong base, some of the acetic acid may be deprotonated. wait, but the strong base (oh−) is in excess here? let me check. total h+ before mixing is 0.08 mol. total oh− is 0.18 mol. if we mix them, they'll react in a 1:1 molar ratio: h+ + oh− → h2o so, the oh− will neutralize 0.08 mol h+, and there will be 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol oh− remaining. but wait, but we also have acetic acid present. so perhaps the remaining oh− will react with the acetic acid? acetic acid's conjugate base is ch3coo−. the reaction would be: ch3cooh + oh− → ch3coo− + h2o but this is an acid-base reaction where oh− deprotonates acetic acid. the number of moles of oh− remaining after neutralizing the hcl's h+ is 0.10 mol. the initial moles of acetic acid are 0.05 mol. so, if we add 0.10 mol oh− to 0.05 mol ch3cooh, how does this reaction go? the oh− will abstract protons from the acetic acid. the amount of ch3cooh that reacts is equal to the moles of oh− added, up to the amount of ch3cooh present. wait, but here we have 0.10 mol oh− and only 0.05 mol ch3cooh. so, all of the acetic acid will react, and there will still be 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol oh− left over. wait, but let me confirm: the oh− will react with the acetic acid in a 1:1 molar ratio (since each oh− deprotonates one ch3cooh). if there's 0.10 mol oh− and 0.05 mol ch3cooh, then they'll consume all 0.05 mol of ch3cooh and 0.05 mol of oh−, leaving 0.05 mol oh− unreacted. is that right? yes. so, the reaction is: ch3cooh + oh− → ch3coo− + h2o moles reacted: 0.05 mol (all of the ch3cooh) therefore, moles of ch3coo− formed = 0.05 mol. and the remaining oh− is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol. therefore, after all reactions, we have: - 0.05 mol ch3coo− - 0.05 mol oh− from the excess base. now, we have to find the total volume of the solution. the total volume is 500 ml + 400 ml + 300 ml = 1200 ml = 1.2 l. so, the concentration of oh− is 0.05 mol / 1.2 l = 0.04167 m. then, poh = -log[oh−] = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38. therefore, ph = 14 - poh = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62. wait, but one of the options is 12.62 (option c). but hold on, let me check again. wait, but is this correct? because when ba(oh)2 is added, which is a strong base, and hcl is a strong acid, their moles would neutralize each other, and then the excess base would deprotonate the weak acid. but after that, the solution is basic, so the ph should be high. 12.62 is a basic ph, so that's possible. but let me go through the calculations step by step to make sure. first, calculating moles: hcl: 0.4 l * 0.2 m = 0.08 mol h+. ba(oh)2: 0.3 l * 0.3 m = 0.09 mol ba(oh)2. since each mole of ba(oh)2 gives 2 oh−, that's 0.18 mol oh−. ch3cooh: 0.5 l * 0.1 m = 0.05 mol. then, mixing h+ and oh−: they react in a 1:1 ratio. the h+ is 0.08 mol and oh− is 0.18 mol. so, after reaction, remaining oh− is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol. then, this 0.10 mol oh− is added to the acetic acid solution. the acetic acid is 0.05 mol. the reaction between oh− and ch3cooh is: ch3cooh + oh− → ch3coo− + h2o. since we have 0.10 mol oh− and 0.05 mol ch3cooh, the limiting reagent is ch3cooh. so, 0.05 mol of oh− will react with 0.05 mol of ch3cooh to produce 0.05 mol ch3coo−, and the remaining oh− is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol. therefore, after reaction, we have: - 0.05 mol ch3coo− - 0.05 mol oh−. total volume is 0.5 + 0.4 + 0.3 = 1.2 l. so, [oh−] = 0.05 mol / 1.2 l ≈ 0.04167 m. poh = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38. therefore, ph = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62. so, the answer would be c) 12.62. but let me think again. did i consider all the species? the acetate ion (ch3coo−) is the conjugate base of a weak acid, so in a basic solution, it might hydrolyze: ch3coo− + h2o ⇌ ch3cooh + oh−. but since the solution is already basic (we have excess oh−), maybe the hydrolysis is negligible? wait, but maybe i need to perform a more precise calculation considering the hydrolysis of acetate? wait, but in a solution with high oh− concentration, adding a weak base's conjugate ion might not hydrolyze much. the hydroxide concentration is 0.04167 m, which is pretty high. the acetate will hydrolyze according to the equation: ch3coo− + h2o ⇌ ch3cooh + oh− the equilibrium constant for this is kb = kw/ka_acetic_acid. let's see: ka of acetic acid is 1.8x10^-5. so, kb = 1.0x10^-14 / 1.8x10^-5 ≈ 5.56x10^-10. so, kb is very small, which means the hydrolysis of acetate is negligible. moreover, the solution already has a high oh− concentration. so, even if some acetate hydrolyzes, producing more oh− and acetic acid, but since the concentration of oh− is already high, the hydrolysis would be even less likely. alternatively, perhaps i can do an ice table? let me see. the initial concentration of ch3coo− is 0.05 mol / 1.2 l ≈ 0.04167 m. the initial concentration of oh− is 0.04167 m. let’s denote the hydrolysis reaction: ch3coo− + h2o ⇌ ch3cooh + oh− initial concentrations: [ch3coo−] = 0.04167 m [ch3cooh] = 0 (since all acetic acid was deprotonated? wait, no. wait, after reaction, the initial moles of ch3cooh would be zero, because all 0.05 mol reacted to form ch3coo−. but then, when we consider hydrolysis, the ch3coo− would react to form ch3cooh and oh−. but the initial [oh−] from the excess base is also 0.04167 m. the kb is 5.56x10^-10. let s be the concentration of oh− increase due to hydrolysis. then: [oh−] = 0.04167 + s ≈ 0.04167 m because s is very small. similarly, [ch3cooh] = s [ch3coo−] = 0.04167 - s ≈ 0.04167 m then, kb = [ch3cooh][oh−] / [ch3coo−] ≈ (s)(0.04167) / 0.04167) = s. therefore, s ≈ kb = 5.56x10^-10. so the increase in oh− is negligible compared to the initial 0.04167 m. therefore, the contribution of acetate hydrolysis to ph can be ignored. therefore, the ph is determined primarily by the remaining oh− from the excess ba(oh)2, after neutralizing hcl and reacting with acetic acid. therefore, ph calculation as before is valid. thus, the answer is c) 12.62. but let me check the answer choices again. the options are a) 8.68, b) 8.92, c) 12.62, d) 1.38. 12.62 is there, and since the solution is basic, that makes sense. alternatively, maybe i made a mistake in the process? let's confirm: 1. calculated moles: hcl: 0.08 mol h+ ba(oh)2: 0.18 mol oh− ch3cooh: 0.05 mol. 2. mix h+ and oh−: 0.08 mol h+ + 0.18 mol oh− → 0.10 mol oh− remaining. 3. this 0.10 mol oh− reacts with 0.05 mol ch3cooh → 0.05 mol ch3coo− and 0.05 mol oh− remaining. 4. total volume: 1.2 l. 5. [oh−] = 0.05 mol / 1.2 l = 0.04167 m. 6. poh = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38, so ph = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62. that's correct. so, the answer is c. i think that's it.

answer: to determine the ph of the solution containing 500 ml of 0.1 m ch3cooh, 400 ml of 0.2 m hcl, and 300 ml of 0.3 m ba(oh)2, we follow these steps:

1. **calculate moles of each component:**
   - **hcl:** \(0.4 \, \text{l} \times 0.2 \, \text{m} = 0.08 \, \text{mol h}^+\)
   - **ba(oh)2:** \(0.3 \, \text{l} \times 0.3 \, \text{m} = 0.09 \, \text{mol}\) ba(oh)2, which provides \(0.18 \, \text{mol oh}^-\)
   - **ch3cooh:** \(0.5 \, \text{l} \times 0.1 \, \text{m} = 0.05 \, \text{mol}\)

2. **neutralize h+ and oh−:**
   - h+ from hcl (0.08 mol) reacts with oh− from ba(oh)2 (0.18 mol), leaving \(0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{mol oh}^-\).

3. **react remaining oh− with ch3cooh:**
   - oh− (0.10 mol) reacts with ch3cooh (0.05 mol) in a 1:1 ratio:
     - products: 0.05 mol ch3coo− and 0.05 mol oh− remaining.

4. **calculate oh− concentration in total volume (1.2 l):**
   - \([ \text{oh}^- ] = \frac{0.05 \, \text{mol}}{1.2 \, \text{l}} \approx 0.04167 \, \text{m}\)

5. **determine poh and ph:**
   - \( \text{poh} = -\log(0.04167) \approx 1.38 \)
   - \( \text{ph} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62 \)

the final answer is \boxed{c}
