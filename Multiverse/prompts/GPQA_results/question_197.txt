Okay, let's try to work through this problem step by step. First, I need to identify the final product after X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The problem provides IR and 1H NMR data for compound X. Let me start by analyzing the spectroscopic data to figure out what X is, and then consider the reaction conditions to determine the product.
Let's think in parallel.

1: The IR spectrum of compound X exhibits bands at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, 1720 cm⁻¹, 1610 cm⁻¹, and 1450 cm⁻¹. The NMR data includes a broad singlet (bs) at 10.5 ppm (1H), a doublet (d) at 8.0 ppm (2H), a doublet (d) at 7.2 ppm (2H), a multiplet (m) at 2.9 ppm (1H), a multiplet (m) at 1.7 ppm (2H), a doublet (d) at 1.4 ppm (3H), and a triplet (t) at 0.9 ppm (3H). The IR band in the 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ range suggests the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O stretch around 1720 cm⁻¹) and possibly an alcohol or carboxylic acid. The 10.5 ppm signal in the NMR is characteristic of a carbonyl group, likely a carboxylic acid or a ketone. The 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm signals, each a doublet of 2H, are indicative of an aromatic ring, possibly a substituted benzene with two adjacent substituents, resulting in a meta coupling pattern. The 1.4 ppm signal is consistent with a carboxylic acid proton. The presence of a carbonyl group is indicated by the 1720 cm⁻¹ IR band corresponds to a carbonyl (C=O), and possibly a branching, given the other IR bands at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are consistent with aromatic C=C stretching and out-of-plane C-H bending in an aromatic ring. The 1H NMR signal integration values (1H, 2H, 2H, 1H, 2H, 3H, 3H) sum to 15 protons. The structure of compound X is proposed as 4-(2-methylpropyl)benzoic acid, also known as 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, based on the analysis.

2: Now, let's look at the NMR data. The 1H NMR spectrum is given as: 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H), 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).
Starting with the aromatic region: the two doublets at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) suggest a para-substituted benzene ring. The two doublets indicate that there are substituents on the benzene ring, and the splitting (each as a doublet) suggests that the adjacent protons are equivalent. For para substitution, substituents are on opposite sides, so the neighboring protons would be equivalent, leading to doublets. If it was ortho or meta substitution, the splitting would be more complex. So, the aromatic protons are split into two doublets, each integrating to 2H, consistent with para substitution. So, the benzene ring has two substituents on positions 1 and 4 (or 2 and 5, etc.), making it para. The substituents are likely a carboxylic acid group (from the COOH at 10.5 ppm broad singlet (bs, 1H) supports the presence of a COOH group. So, we have a benzoic acid derivative. The benzene ring is substituted at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (another group). The other NMR signals are: 20 cm and 1450 cm-1 in the IR could correspond to C=O (around 1610 cm-1 was mentioned, which may be the carbonyl stretch of the ester if X was an ester. But if X is a benzoic acid, then the IR would have a broad COOH stretch around 3000-2500 cm-1 (given as 3400–2500 cm-1), and a sharp carbonyl stretch at 1720 cm-1 (which is typical for a carboxylic acid or an ester. Wait, carboxylic acids have O-H broad stretch around 3000-2500 cm-1, and a carbonyl stretch at around 1710 cm-1. The 1610 cm-1 could be the C=C stretching in the aromatic ring. 1450 cm-1 might be a deformation mode. Alternatively, if X is an ester (benzoate), then the carbonyl stretch would be slightly lower, around 1720 cm-1, which is what is observed. But the presence of a broad peak at 10.5 ppm (1H, bs) suggests a COOH group, which would indicate that X is a benzoic acid. Wait, but if X is a benzoic acid, then the carbonyl (C=O) would be at ~1710 cm-1, and the O-H stretch at 3000–2500 cm-1. However, the given IR data shows 3400–2500 cm-1 (which is a very broad range, maybe indicating overlapping peaks or a mistake in the problem). Typically, the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid is around 3000-2500 cm-1 (but that's a wide range; usually, it's around 2500-3000 for broad O-H). But the 10.5 ppm in NMR is a broad singlet, typical of a COOH group in D2O exchange, confirming the presence of a carboxylic acid. So X is likely 4-substituted benzoic acid. The other NMR signals: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) – this is the aromatic proton next to the COOH group (in the meta or para position). Since benzoic acid has protons at the para position (if substituent is at 1, then the protons at 4 would be next to COOH). Wait, in benzoic acid, the COOH is at position 1; the adjacent protons would be meta (if substituent is at 1 and 4, then the protons at 2 and 3 for COOH at 1, and substituent at 4. Wait, maybe the compound is 4-substituted benzoic acid. The 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) would be the protons ortho and meta to the COOH group (but in a meta arrangement if there's another substituent). Wait, perhaps the substituents are at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (another group), making the aromatic protons at positions 2 and 3 (which are each adjacent to the COOH and the other substituent). Alternatively, if the substituents are para to each other, then the splitting might be different. Alternatively, maybe the compound is 4-alkylbenzoic acid, where the alkyl group is on the para position. Let me map this out. The COOH is at position 1. The substituent (alkyl group) is at position 4. Then the aromatic protons at positions 2 and 3 (each adjacent to the COOH and the substituent) would be deshielded, perhaps around 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). Then the protons at position 6 would be next to the substituent and perhaps split as a doublet. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's look at the NMR data again. The aromatic signals: 10.5 (bs, 1H) – COOH (but wait, carboxylic acid protons are usually around 12-13 ppm. Wait, this is a big discrepancy. Wait, carboxylic acids in NMR have broad singlets around 12-13 ppm. But here, the peak is at 10.5 ppm. Is that an error? Alternatively, maybe it's a different functional group. Wait, but the IR has 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl stretch. If the NMR has a broad peak around 10.5 ppm, perhaps it's a conjugated system or an ester. Wait, maybe X is an ester. Then the 1720 cm-1 would be the ester carbonyl. But then the 10.5 ppm might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe X is a ketone? But there's no aromatic signals around 2.05 ppm for a ketone. Alternatively, maybe the 10.5 ppm is a typo and should be 1.05 ppm. But then what? Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a carboxylic acid but in D2O, the exchange would happen, but the peak is残留. Alternatively, maybe it's an amide, but then the IR would show different bands. Wait, the IR has 3400–2500 cm-1, which could be a broad O-H stretch (carboxylic acid or alcohol), 1720 is carbonyl (ester or ketone), 1610 and 1450 cm-1 (aromatic C=C). So maybe X is an aromatic ester with a carbonyl group. Wait, if X is an aromatic ester, like phenyl acetate, then the IR would show an ester carbonyl at 1720. But the NMR has a broad singlet that's not typical for an ester. Alternatively, maybe X is an aromatic ketone, but ketones don't have O-H groups unless there's something else. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a methyl acrylate or something, but then the aromatic signals don't fit. Wait, let's consider the NMR again. The signals are: 10.5 (bs, 1H) – maybe a carbonyl α proton? Like in a ketone or ester. But位置: for example, if it's a propionates, the α proton could be around 2-3 ppm. Alternatively, if there's a conjugated system. Alternatively, maybe the compound is a cinnamic acid derivative, with a conjugated double bond. The 10.5 ppm could be the proton at the end of the conjugated system. Wait, but that's stretching. Alternatively, maybe the compound is a lactone. Then the 1720 is the ester carbonyl. The 10.5 ppm might not fit. Alternatively, maybe X is an aromatic aldehyde. Then the IR would have a strong absorption around 1720 (aldehyde), and the NMR would have a singlet around 10 ppm. But aldehydes are usually at higher ppm. For example, formaldehyde is around 9-10 ppm, but aromatic aldehydes like benzaldehyde have the aldehyde proton around 10-11 ppm. So if X is an aromatic aldehyde, then 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) could be the aldehyde proton. Then the IR would have the aldehyde stretch at 1720 (which is correct). The other peaks: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) would be the aromatic protons. Splitting as doublets suggest that the protons are next to substituents with coupling to protons on only one adjacent position. For example, if the aldehyde is at position 1 and there's a substituent at position 3, then the protons at positions 4 and 5 would couple as doublets. But in benzaldehyde, the aldehyde proton is at 10 ppm, and the ring protons are ortho, meta, para. The para proton would be a doublet (if there's another substituent in the ring). Alternatively, maybe the compound is 4-substituted benzaldehyde. The substitution at position 4 would cause the aromatic protons at positions 2 and 3 (assuming aldehyde at position 1) to be split into doublets. But then the 8.0 and 7.2 ppm would correspond to these protons. Alternatively, let's think about the structure. Suppose the compound is 4-sec-butylbenzaldehyde. The aldehyde group is at position 1, and a sec-butyl group is at position 4. The aromatic protons at positions 2 and 3 would be next to the aldehyde and the sec-butyl group. Their chemical shifts would be upfield or downfield depending on the substituents. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an ester or ether. Alternatively, considering the NMR data: the 10.5 ppm bs (1H) is the aldehyde. Then the next signals: 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H). If the aldehyde is at position 1 and there is another substituent (an oxygen-containing group) at position 4, causing the aromatic protons to split into doublets. Wait, but oxygen directs incoming substituents para/ortho. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a halogen, which can be meta or para. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is another electron-withdrawing group. Alternatively, if the substituent is a methyl group, but that wouldn't cause splitting. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a nitro group, but that would have a downfield shift. Alternatively, maybe the compound is veratraldehyde – o-, m-, or p-hydroxybenzaldehyde. But then the IR would show O-H stretching. But in the given IR, the only broad peak is 3400–2500, which could be O-H or aldehyde O-H. If it's a hydroxybenzaldehyde, then the IR would have a broad O-H peak. However, the NMR doesn't show a hydroxyl peak (unless it's exchanging or in D2O). Alternatively, if the compound is phenylacetone – an aromatic ketone. The 1720 cm-1 would not be expected for a ketone (ketones are around 1715). Alternatively, maybe X is a nitro compound. The IR would have nitro bands around 1550-1350, but the given IR peaks are 1610 and 1450. Alternatively, maybe X is a nitrile. The IR has a nitrile triple bond around 2200 cm-1, which is not listed. Alternatively, let's go back to the reaction condition: X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Red P and HI are used in the phosphoryl chloride exchange or in substitution reactions. Wait, red phosphorus and HI is used for substituting leaving groups, like in the conversion of a good leaving group (like a tosyl group) to Iodide for SNAr reactions. Wait, but if X is an aryl halide, this doesn't help. Alternatively, maybe X is an ester, and the reaction converts it to another functional group. Wait, but the reaction of esters with HI and red phosphorus would generate the corresponding acid and iodide ester? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is Hell–Volhard–Zelinskyl reaction, but that requires acid chloride. Alternatively, maybe it's a Hofmann degradation, but that's for amides. Wait, but the problem is to identify the final product after reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Given that X has a carbonyl group (IR 1720 cm-1) and a broad O-H stretch (IR 3400–2500 cm-1), and the NMR shows a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm (1H), which could be a hydroxyl group or an aldehyde proton. If X is an aromatic aldehyde with a substituent that causes the aromatic protons to split as doublets, then reacting with HI and red phosphorus might perform an aldehyde reaction. Wait, but aldehydes can undergo many reactions with HI, such as the formation of iodoform if the aldehyde is a methyl ketone. But X is an aromatic aldehyde. Alternatively, HI can be a reagent in aromatic substitutions. Alternatively, the reaction could be sulfonation or nitration, but red phosphorus is used in some reactions like the Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement. Alternatively, red phosphorus and HI might be used to convert a leaving group to iodide for a nucleophilic substitution. If X is an aryl chloride, treating with red phosphorus and HI would convert it to aryl iodide (Finkelstein reaction). But in that case, the starting material would be an aryl halide. But X's IR shows a carbonyl at 1720 cm-1. Alternatively, if X is an aryl ester, then treating with HI would cleave the ester. For example, the ester could be converted to the corresponding acid and alcohol. But HI is a strong acid and can also cause substitution. Alternatively, maybe the reaction converts the carbonyl group. For example, if X is an ester, then HI could hydrolyze it to carboxylic acid. But in what conditions? Alternatively, the reaction might be a substitution at the aryl ring. If X is an aryl ester with a good leaving group, red P and HI could substitute the leaving group with iodide. But the product would then be an aryl iodide ester. But the final product would depend on what the leaving group is. Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzoin-type structure, but the NMR doesn't suggest that. Alternatively, maybe X is a cinnamic acid derivative. The IR shows the carbonyl (1720 cm-1) and the C=C (1610 cm-1). The NMR has a broad proton at 10.5 ppm (the α-hydrogen). But then the aromatic signals would be different. Alternatively, let's try to piece together the structure from NMR. The 10.5 ppm bs (1H) could be a terminal alkyne proton, but those are usually higher, around 15 ppm. Alternatively, maybe it's a nitrile proton, but nitriles don't show up around 10.5. Alternatively, maybe it's a acidic proton like a alcohol or amine, but those are usually lower field. Alternatively, perhaps X is a acid chloride. Then the NMR would have a singlet around 10 ppm for the Cl. But acid chlorides are not in the IR. Alternatively, maybe X is a ester with a branching that places the adjacent proton at 10.5 ppm. Alternatively, maybe the structure is such: the compound is an aromatic ring with a carbonyl group (ester) and a hydroxyl group. The IR would show both the carbonyl and O-H. But the NMR 10.5 ppm would then be the hydroxyl, which would exchange. However, in the NMR, if recorded in D2O, the hydroxyl would be suppressed. Alternatively, maybe the compound is a lactone. Then the 10.5 ppm could be an endo proton. But that's usually around 4-5 ppm. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a ortho-nitrophenoxide, but that's speculative. Given that this is getting too convoluted, perhaps I should look at the answer choices. But since they aren't provided, I need to proceed. Alternatively, maybe X is a cinnamic acid derivative. For example, if X is 4-hydroxy cinnamic acid, the structure would be: Ph-COOH with a hydroxyl and a double bond. The IR would show O-H (broad), carbonyl (1720), and C=C (1610). The NMR would have a broad peak from the COOH (10.5 ppm), a peak from the C=C proton (maybe around 7.2-8.0 as multiplets), but that doesn't fit the data. Alternatively, maybe X is a ester of a substituted benzoic acid. For example, phenyl acetate would have an ester carbonyl at 1720 cm-1, aromatic rings, and the NMR would have a singlet for the methyl group. But where's the 10.5 ppm? Alternatively, maybe X is a amide. Then the carbonyl would be around 1720, but the NMR would have an NH group. But the 10.5 ppm is too high for an amide proton, unless it's in a specific environment. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a aryl nitrile. The nitrile would have a C≡N around 2200 cm-1 (not present in IR data given). Alternatively, maybe X is a acid anhydride. But those have two carbonyls, and the NMR would have different shifts. Alternatively, maybe the problem has a typo. If the NMR peak is 10.5 ppm for the aldehyde, and other signals at 8.0 and 7.2 for the aromatic protons, then the structure could be 4-substituted benzaldehyde. The splitting suggests that the aromatic protons next to the substituent are deshielded. For example, if there is an electron-withdrawing group at position 4, the protons at positions 2 and 3 would be deshielded and split as doublets. The substituent at position 4 could be another group like a nitro or carbonyl. Wait, but the IR shows a carbonyl at 1720 cm-1, so perhaps the substituent is an ester. So the compound could be 4-estherbenzaldehyde? That seems complex. Alternatively, maybe X is a molecule where the aldehyde is ortho to an ester group. Then the ester's carbonyl is at 1720, and the aldehyde is at 10.5 ppm (but aldehydes are around 10 ppm). The aromatic protons adjacent to both the aldehyde and ester would be split. However, such a structure might not be stable. Alternatively, maybe X is a benzaldehyde with an acetyl group attached meta. The acetyl group would give the carbonyl at 1720. But the NMR splitting is two doublets. Alternatively, considering all this confusion, maybe the correct approach is to recognize that the reaction with red phosphorus and HI is indicative of a substitution reaction. For example, if X is an aryl halide, then treatment with red phosphorus and excess HI would perform a substitution (Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement?), but more likely, it's a Swern oxidation or some other reaction. Wait, but red P and HI is used in the phosphoryl chloride exchange or in the conversion of chlorides to iodides (Finkelstein reaction). If X is an aryl chloride, then treatment with red phosphorus and HI would convert it to aryl iodide. But in that case, the starting material would be an aryl halide. But X's IR shows a carbonyl at 1720 cm-1, so X isn't just an aryl halide. Alternatively, if X is an aryl ester, then treating with HI would hydrolyze it to carboxylic acid. But how? Alternatively, perhaps X is an aryl thioester. Treatment with HI could convert it to a different ester. Alternatively, the reaction might be a nucleophilic substitution on the carbonyl. For example, if X is an acid chloride, then HI could nucleophilically attack, but acid chlorides react with HI to form HCl and iodoalkane. But X's IR has a carbonyl at 1720, which is more of an ester or ketone. If X is an ester, then HI would hydrolyze it to carboxylic acid and alcohol. But under what conditions? With red phosphorus, which is used as a catalyst in some reactions. For example, in the Hell–Volhard–Zelinskyl reaction, red phosphorus and HI are used to convert a carboxylic acid to an acyl halide. But that requires COsh. Alternatively, maybe X is a ketone, and the reaction converts it to an iodo compound. But ketones don't typically react with HI. Alternatively, the reaction could be an example of the Jones oxidation, but that uses CrO3. Alternatively, HI can add to alkenes in a hydroiodic acid reaction. If X has a C=C bond (as indicated by the 1610 cm-1 in IR), then HI could add across the double bond. But X is an aromatic compound, so the C=C is part of the aromatic ring, to which HI doesn't add. Alternatively, the presence of red phosphorus might lead to the Pinacol coupling or similar. Alternatively, considering all the information, perhaps X is a aryl ester, and the reaction converts it to the corresponding aryl iodide. For example, if X is an aryl chloroformate, reacting with red phosphorus and HI would generate the aryl iodide. But this is speculative. Alternatively, let's think of the options given. Since the user says to select from A, B, C, D, which are likely structures. Since the user hasn't provided the options, I need to make an educated guess. Given that the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, common transformations include converting chlorides to iodides, or substituting leaving groups. If X has a carbonyl and an aromatic ring, the final product might be an aryl iodide. For example, if X is an aryl ester (like methyl benzoate), then treatment with HI and red P would hydrolyze the ester to benzoic acid and then possibly convert it to an aryl iodide. But how? Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, where a leaving group (like a tosyl group) is replaced by iodide. But X's IR doesn't show a sulfonate group. Alternatively, if X is an aryl ketone, reacting with HI and red phosphorus might perform something like the Ritter reaction (but that uses aqueous H2SO4). Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a radical halogenation. But red phosphorus can be used to reduce halogens. Alternatively, the problem might be about the Reimer-Tiemann reaction, but that forms phenolic compounds. Alternatively, considering the NMR data: the two aromatic singlets (8.0 and 7.2) each integrating to 2H, and the coupling (doublets) suggest that each pair of protons is next to each other and split only by protons on one adjacent position. This would occur in a 1,4-dichlorobenzene structure, but with substituents. Alternatively, if X is terephthalic acid (benzene with two COOH groups at para positions), but the NMR doesn't fit. Alternatively, if X is 4-acetylbenzoic acid, then the IR would have a carbonyl at around 1720 (for the ketone) and 1710 (for the carboxylic acid). But the NMR would have two carbonyls, and the 10.5 ppm would be one of them. But in this case, the aliphatic proton next to the carbonyl (if any) could be around 2.5 ppm. Alternatively, maybe X is methyl 4-acylbenzoate. Then the carbonyl would be present, and the ester carbonyl as well. But this is getting too complicated. Given the lack of answer choices, it's challenging, but based on the reaction conditions (red phosphorus and HI), common products are aryl iodides (from chlorides via Finkelstein), or products of substitution reactions. If X is an aryl chloride with a carbonyl group (like acetophenone chloride), then treatment with HI and red P would convert the chloride to iodide, giving acetophenone iodide. But such compounds are rare. Alternatively, if X is an aryl ketone, and the reaction adds HI. For example, the ketone converts to an iodo compound. Wait, but ketones don't typically react with HI. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is an example of the Hofmann degradation of an amide, but there's no amide peak. Alternatively, considering that the NMR shows an integrated singlet of 1H at 10.5 ppm, which might be a conjugated dienophile. Alternatively, the reaction could be a Prins reaction, but with HI? Alternatively, maybe the compound undergoes iodination at the para position. If the starting material is a substituted benzene with a hydroxyl group and a carbonyl, then treatment with HI and red phosphorus might iodinate the ring. But without knowing the options, it's hard. Given the multiple dead-ends, perhaps the correct answer is that the product is 4-iodobenzoic acid. The reasoning is: X is a 4-substituted benzoic acid (COOH group and another substituent). The IR shows carbonyl (COOH at 1720 cm-1?), O-H stretching (broad around 3400–2500 cm-1), and aromatic C=C. The NMR shows the COOH proton (10.5 ppm), two sets of aromatic protons (doublets at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm), and possibly the substituent is a group that can be replaced by iodine. Reacting with red phosphorus and HI would substitute the leaving group (e.g., a sulfonate group) with iodine, producing 4-iodobenzoic acid. However, the IR doesn't show a sulfonate group. Alternatively, if the substituent is a nitro group, which can be reduced to an amine and then substituted. But this is unclear. Alternatively, if the substituent is a chloride, then with red P and HI, it would convert to iodide. So if X is 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the IR would have COOH (1720 cm-1?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if X is methyl 4-iodobenzoate, but that doesn't fit the NMR. Given the confusion, I need to take a step back. Let's re-examine the given data: IR: 3400–2500 (broad, likely O-H or N-H), 1720 (carbonyl), 1610 and 1450 (aromatic). NMR: 10.5 (bs, 1H) – likely O-H (COOH) or aldehyde. Aromatics at 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H). The coupling suggests each proton is next to another substituent. So the aromatic ring has two substituents, each with adjacent protons. The substituents are at positions that make the protons doublets. For example, if there's a substituent at position 1 and another at position 4, then the protons at positions 2, 3, 5, 6 would be split. But if substituents are at 1 and 3, the splitting would be different. Alternatively, substituents at 1 and 2 (ortho) would cause the remaining protons to couple as doublets. But in that case, there would be more than two protons. But the NMR shows 2 sets of doublets: 8.0 (2H) and 7.2 (2H), so there must be two substituents, each with adjacent protons. The most plausible is a para-substituted benzene with substituents at 1 and 4. Then the protons at 2 & 3 and 5 & 6 would each be doublets. But in that case, their shifts would depend on the nature of the substituents. Now, the carbonyl at 1720 is likely an ester. If X is methyl 4-substituted benzoate, then the IR matches. The NMR would have the ester's methyl group around 3.7 ppm (but that's not mentioned). Alternatively, if X is a different ester. But the 10.5 ppm doesn't fit an ester. Alternatively, maybe the carbonyl is a ketone. Then X is 4-alkylbenzene-carbonitrile? Not sure. Alternatively, if X is 4-acetylbenzoic acid, then the carbonyl would be the ketone (1720 cm-1) and COOH at 1710 cm-1), but the NMR would have two carbonyl regions. The 10.5 ppm would be the COOH. But the coupling of the aromatic protons would need to match. Alternatively, the answer is that X is converted into 4-iodoacetophenone. But without knowing the options, it's hard. Given that the reaction is with HI and red phosphorus, a common transformation is the conversion of a chloroarene into an iodoarene. But if X is an ester or has a leaving group, the reaction might replace that. For example, if X is methyl 4-chlorobenzoate, reacting with red P and HI would convert the chloride to iodide, forming methyl 4-iodobenzoate. The final product would then be a methyl benzoate ester with an iodide substituent. But how does that align with the NMR and IR? Alternatively, if X is an aryl sulfonate, which is a good leaving group. Treatment with HI and red P would replace the sulfonate with iodide. Suppose X is p-toluenesulfonate... but this is unclear. Considering all the uncertainty and potential for multiple wrong paths, I need to make an educated guess. Given the reaction conditions (red phosphorus and HI), the reaction is likely a substitution where a leaving group on an aromatic ring is replaced by iodine. The starting material X has a carbonyl group (maybe an ester), a broad O-H stretch (suggesting a hydroxyl or carboxylic acid), and aromatic rings. The NMR shows an aldehyde proton (10.5 ppm) or a COOH proton. If X is a 4-substituted benzoic acid with another substituent that's a good leaving group (like a tosyl group), the reaction replaces that substituent with iodine, forming 4-iodobenzoic acid. The IR matches with COOH (1720 cm-1) and O-H (broad). However, COOH is usually around 1710, so maybe the 1720 is an ester. If X is methyl 4-hydroxybenzoate, the IR would show both O-H and ester carbonyl. The NMR would have the ester methyl group, but it's not mentioned. Alternatively, if X is 4-formylbenzoic acid (although that would have two carbonyls), but that's unlikely. Given the lack of progress, and considering common exam problems, the answer might be that the product is 4-iodobenzoic acid. Thus, after reacting with red P and HI, the leaving group (e.g., chloride) is replaced by iodine. Therefore, the final answer is \boxed{D} (assuming D is 4-iodobenzoic acid). However, without options, this is a guess. But since the user specified to think step by step, here's the summary: After analyzing the IR (broad O-H, ester/carbonyl at 1720, aromatic), NMR (10.5 ppm bs, 8.0 and 7.2 aromatic doublets), and reaction conditions (red P and HI), the structure of X is deduced to be a 4-substituted benzoic acid or ester with a leaving group. The reaction replaces the leaving group with iodine, producing 4-iodobenzoic acid or a similar iodo-substituted aromatic carboxylic acid. Given the options would likely include such a structure, the answer is \boxed{D}. However, since the actual options aren't provided, this is based on common problem types.

Answer: To solve this problem, we need to determine the structure of compound X based on its spectroscopic data and infer the product formed upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI. 

### Key Analysis:
1. **IR Spectroscopy**:
   - **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad)**: Suggests an O-H stretch, indicative of a hydroxyl or carboxylic acid group.
   - **1720 cm⁻¹**: Carbonyl stretch, typical of an ester or ketone.
   - **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹**: Characteristic of aromatic C=C stretching modes.

2. **NMR Spectroscopy**:
   - **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: Likely a broad singlet, possibly due to a COOH group (though typically higher ppm) or an aldehyde proton.
   - **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Aromatic protons split into doublets, indicating symmetry and neighboring substituents. This splitting suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring with two substituents causing adjacent proton coupling.

3. **Reaction Conditions**:
   - **Red phosphorus and HI**: Commonly used in nucleophilic aromatic substitutions, particularly for converting good leaving groups (like to<Conclusion>

okay, let's try to work through this problem step by step. first, i need to identify the final product after x reacts with red phosphorus and hi. the problem provides ir and 1h nmr data for compound x. let me start by analyzing the spectroscopic data to figure out what x is, and then consider the reaction conditions to determine the product.
let's think in parallel.

1: the ir spectrum of compound x exhibits bands at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, 1720 cm⁻¹, 1610 cm⁻¹, and 1450 cm⁻¹. the nmr data includes a broad singlet (bs) at 10.5 ppm (1h), a doublet (d) at 8.0 ppm (2h), a doublet (d) at 7.2 ppm (2h), a multiplet (m) at 2.9 ppm (1h), a multiplet (m) at 1.7 ppm (2h), a doublet (d) at 1.4 ppm (3h), and a triplet (t) at 0.9 ppm (3h). the ir band in the 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ range suggests the presence of a carbonyl group (c=o stretch around 1720 cm⁻¹) and possibly an alcohol or carboxylic acid. the 10.5 ppm signal in the nmr is characteristic of a carbonyl group, likely a carboxylic acid or a ketone. the 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm signals, each a doublet of 2h, are indicative of an aromatic ring, possibly a substituted benzene with two adjacent substituents, resulting in a meta coupling pattern. the 1.4 ppm signal is consistent with a carboxylic acid proton. the presence of a carbonyl group is indicated by the 1720 cm⁻¹ ir band corresponds to a carbonyl (c=o), and possibly a branching, given the other ir bands at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ are consistent with aromatic c=c stretching and out-of-plane c-h bending in an aromatic ring. the 1h nmr signal integration values (1h, 2h, 2h, 1h, 2h, 3h, 3h) sum to 15 protons. the structure of compound x is proposed as 4-(2-methylpropyl)benzoic acid, also known as 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, based on the analysis.

2: now, let's look at the nmr data. the 1h nmr spectrum is given as: 10.5 ppm (bs, 1h), 8.0 ppm (d, 2h), 7.2 ppm (d, 2h), 2.9 ppm (m, 1h), 1.7 ppm (m, 2h), 1.4 ppm (d, 3h), 0.9 ppm (t, 3h).
starting with the aromatic region: the two doublets at 8.0 ppm (d, 2h) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2h) suggest a para-substituted benzene ring. the two doublets indicate that there are substituents on the benzene ring, and the splitting (each as a doublet) suggests that the adjacent protons are equivalent. for para substitution, substituents are on opposite sides, so the neighboring protons would be equivalent, leading to doublets. if it was ortho or meta substitution, the splitting would be more complex. so, the aromatic protons are split into two doublets, each integrating to 2h, consistent with para substitution. so, the benzene ring has two substituents on positions 1 and 4 (or 2 and 5, etc.), making it para. the substituents are likely a carboxylic acid group (from the cooh at 10.5 ppm broad singlet (bs, 1h) supports the presence of a cooh group. so, we have a benzoic acid derivative. the benzene ring is substituted at positions 1 (cooh) and 4 (another group). the other nmr signals are: 20 cm and 1450 cm-1 in the ir could correspond to c=o (around 1610 cm-1 was mentioned, which may be the carbonyl stretch of the ester if x was an ester. but if x is a benzoic acid, then the ir would have a broad cooh stretch around 3000-2500 cm-1 (given as 3400–2500 cm-1), and a sharp carbonyl stretch at 1720 cm-1 (which is typical for a carboxylic acid or an ester. wait, carboxylic acids have o-h broad stretch around 3000-2500 cm-1, and a carbonyl stretch at around 1710 cm-1. the 1610 cm-1 could be the c=c stretching in the aromatic ring. 1450 cm-1 might be a deformation mode. alternatively, if x is an ester (benzoate), then the carbonyl stretch would be slightly lower, around 1720 cm-1, which is what is observed. but the presence of a broad peak at 10.5 ppm (1h, bs) suggests a cooh group, which would indicate that x is a benzoic acid. wait, but if x is a benzoic acid, then the carbonyl (c=o) would be at ~1710 cm-1, and the o-h stretch at 3000–2500 cm-1. however, the given ir data shows 3400–2500 cm-1 (which is a very broad range, maybe indicating overlapping peaks or a mistake in the problem). typically, the o-h stretch in a carboxylic acid is around 3000-2500 cm-1 (but that's a wide range; usually, it's around 2500-3000 for broad o-h). but the 10.5 ppm in nmr is a broad singlet, typical of a cooh group in d2o exchange, confirming the presence of a carboxylic acid. so x is likely 4-substituted benzoic acid. the other nmr signals: 8.0 ppm (d, 2h) – this is the aromatic proton next to the cooh group (in the meta or para position). since benzoic acid has protons at the para position (if substituent is at 1, then the protons at 4 would be next to cooh). wait, in benzoic acid, the cooh is at position 1; the adjacent protons would be meta (if substituent is at 1 and 4, then the protons at 2 and 3 for cooh at 1, and substituent at 4. wait, maybe the compound is 4-substituted benzoic acid. the 8.0 ppm (d, 2h) would be the protons ortho and meta to the cooh group (but in a meta arrangement if there's another substituent). wait, perhaps the substituents are at positions 1 (cooh) and 4 (another group), making the aromatic protons at positions 2 and 3 (which are each adjacent to the cooh and the other substituent). alternatively, if the substituents are para to each other, then the splitting might be different. alternatively, maybe the compound is 4-alkylbenzoic acid, where the alkyl group is on the para position. let me map this out. the cooh is at position 1. the substituent (alkyl group) is at position 4. then the aromatic protons at positions 2 and 3 (each adjacent to the cooh and the substituent) would be deshielded, perhaps around 8.0 ppm (d, 2h). then the protons at position 6 would be next to the substituent and perhaps split as a doublet. wait, maybe i'm overcomplicating. let's look at the nmr data again. the aromatic signals: 10.5 (bs, 1h) – cooh (but wait, carboxylic acid protons are usually around 12-13 ppm. wait, this is a big discrepancy. wait, carboxylic acids in nmr have broad singlets around 12-13 ppm. but here, the peak is at 10.5 ppm. is that an error? alternatively, maybe it's a different functional group. wait, but the ir has 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl stretch. if the nmr has a broad peak around 10.5 ppm, perhaps it's a conjugated system or an ester. wait, maybe x is an ester. then the 1720 cm-1 would be the ester carbonyl. but then the 10.5 ppm might not make sense. alternatively, maybe x is a ketone? but there's no aromatic signals around 2.05 ppm for a ketone. alternatively, maybe the 10.5 ppm is a typo and should be 1.05 ppm. but then what? alternatively, perhaps the compound is a carboxylic acid but in d2o, the exchange would happen, but the peak is残留. alternatively, maybe it's an amide, but then the ir would show different bands. wait, the ir has 3400–2500 cm-1, which could be a broad o-h stretch (carboxylic acid or alcohol), 1720 is carbonyl (ester or ketone), 1610 and 1450 cm-1 (aromatic c=c). so maybe x is an aromatic ester with a carbonyl group. wait, if x is an aromatic ester, like phenyl acetate, then the ir would show an ester carbonyl at 1720. but the nmr has a broad singlet that's not typical for an ester. alternatively, maybe x is an aromatic ketone, but ketones don't have o-h groups unless there's something else. alternatively, perhaps the compound is a methyl acrylate or something, but then the aromatic signals don't fit. wait, let's consider the nmr again. the signals are: 10.5 (bs, 1h) – maybe a carbonyl α proton? like in a ketone or ester. but位置: for example, if it's a propionates, the α proton could be around 2-3 ppm. alternatively, if there's a conjugated system. alternatively, maybe the compound is a cinnamic acid derivative, with a conjugated double bond. the 10.5 ppm could be the proton at the end of the conjugated system. wait, but that's stretching. alternatively, maybe the compound is a lactone. then the 1720 is the ester carbonyl. the 10.5 ppm might not fit. alternatively, maybe x is an aromatic aldehyde. then the ir would have a strong absorption around 1720 (aldehyde), and the nmr would have a singlet around 10 ppm. but aldehydes are usually at higher ppm. for example, formaldehyde is around 9-10 ppm, but aromatic aldehydes like benzaldehyde have the aldehyde proton around 10-11 ppm. so if x is an aromatic aldehyde, then 10.5 ppm (bs, 1h) could be the aldehyde proton. then the ir would have the aldehyde stretch at 1720 (which is correct). the other peaks: 8.0 ppm (d, 2h) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2h) would be the aromatic protons. splitting as doublets suggest that the protons are next to substituents with coupling to protons on only one adjacent position. for example, if the aldehyde is at position 1 and there's a substituent at position 3, then the protons at positions 4 and 5 would couple as doublets. but in benzaldehyde, the aldehyde proton is at 10 ppm, and the ring protons are ortho, meta, para. the para proton would be a doublet (if there's another substituent in the ring). alternatively, maybe the compound is 4-substituted benzaldehyde. the substitution at position 4 would cause the aromatic protons at positions 2 and 3 (assuming aldehyde at position 1) to be split into doublets. but then the 8.0 and 7.2 ppm would correspond to these protons. alternatively, let's think about the structure. suppose the compound is 4-sec-butylbenzaldehyde. the aldehyde group is at position 1, and a sec-butyl group is at position 4. the aromatic protons at positions 2 and 3 would be next to the aldehyde and the sec-butyl group. their chemical shifts would be upfield or downfield depending on the substituents. alternatively, maybe the substituent is an ester or ether. alternatively, considering the nmr data: the 10.5 ppm bs (1h) is the aldehyde. then the next signals: 8.0 (d, 2h) and 7.2 (d, 2h). if the aldehyde is at position 1 and there is another substituent (an oxygen-containing group) at position 4, causing the aromatic protons to split into doublets. wait, but oxygen directs incoming substituents para/ortho. alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a halogen, which can be meta or para. alternatively, maybe the substituent is another electron-withdrawing group. alternatively, if the substituent is a methyl group, but that wouldn't cause splitting. alternatively, maybe the substituent is a nitro group, but that would have a downfield shift. alternatively, maybe the compound is veratraldehyde – o-, m-, or p-hydroxybenzaldehyde. but then the ir would show o-h stretching. but in the given ir, the only broad peak is 3400–2500, which could be o-h or aldehyde o-h. if it's a hydroxybenzaldehyde, then the ir would have a broad o-h peak. however, the nmr doesn't show a hydroxyl peak (unless it's exchanging or in d2o). alternatively, if the compound is phenylacetone – an aromatic ketone. the 1720 cm-1 would not be expected for a ketone (ketones are around 1715). alternatively, maybe x is a nitro compound. the ir would have nitro bands around 1550-1350, but the given ir peaks are 1610 and 1450. alternatively, maybe x is a nitrile. the ir has a nitrile triple bond around 2200 cm-1, which is not listed. alternatively, let's go back to the reaction condition: x reacts with red phosphorus and hi. red p and hi are used in the phosphoryl chloride exchange or in substitution reactions. wait, red phosphorus and hi is used for substituting leaving groups, like in the conversion of a good leaving group (like a tosyl group) to iodide for snar reactions. wait, but if x is an aryl halide, this doesn't help. alternatively, maybe x is an ester, and the reaction converts it to another functional group. wait, but the reaction of esters with hi and red phosphorus would generate the corresponding acid and iodide ester? not sure. alternatively, maybe the reaction is hell–volhard–zelinskyl reaction, but that requires acid chloride. alternatively, maybe it's a hofmann degradation, but that's for amides. wait, but the problem is to identify the final product after reaction with red phosphorus and hi. given that x has a carbonyl group (ir 1720 cm-1) and a broad o-h stretch (ir 3400–2500 cm-1), and the nmr shows a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm (1h), which could be a hydroxyl group or an aldehyde proton. if x is an aromatic aldehyde with a substituent that causes the aromatic protons to split as doublets, then reacting with hi and red phosphorus might perform an aldehyde reaction. wait, but aldehydes can undergo many reactions with hi, such as the formation of iodoform if the aldehyde is a methyl ketone. but x is an aromatic aldehyde. alternatively, hi can be a reagent in aromatic substitutions. alternatively, the reaction could be sulfonation or nitration, but red phosphorus is used in some reactions like the wagner-meerwein rearrangement. alternatively, red phosphorus and hi might be used to convert a leaving group to iodide for a nucleophilic substitution. if x is an aryl chloride, treating with red phosphorus and hi would convert it to aryl iodide (finkelstein reaction). but in that case, the starting material would be an aryl halide. but x's ir shows a carbonyl at 1720 cm-1. alternatively, if x is an aryl ester, then treating with hi would cleave the ester. for example, the ester could be converted to the corresponding acid and alcohol. but hi is a strong acid and can also cause substitution. alternatively, maybe the reaction converts the carbonyl group. for example, if x is an ester, then hi could hydrolyze it to carboxylic acid. but in what conditions? alternatively, the reaction might be a substitution at the aryl ring. if x is an aryl ester with a good leaving group, red p and hi could substitute the leaving group with iodide. but the product would then be an aryl iodide ester. but the final product would depend on what the leaving group is. alternatively, perhaps x is a benzoin-type structure, but the nmr doesn't suggest that. alternatively, maybe x is a cinnamic acid derivative. the ir shows the carbonyl (1720 cm-1) and the c=c (1610 cm-1). the nmr has a broad proton at 10.5 ppm (the α-hydrogen). but then the aromatic signals would be different. alternatively, let's try to piece together the structure from nmr. the 10.5 ppm bs (1h) could be a terminal alkyne proton, but those are usually higher, around 15 ppm. alternatively, maybe it's a nitrile proton, but nitriles don't show up around 10.5. alternatively, maybe it's a acidic proton like a alcohol or amine, but those are usually lower field. alternatively, perhaps x is a acid chloride. then the nmr would have a singlet around 10 ppm for the cl. but acid chlorides are not in the ir. alternatively, maybe x is a ester with a branching that places the adjacent proton at 10.5 ppm. alternatively, maybe the structure is such: the compound is an aromatic ring with a carbonyl group (ester) and a hydroxyl group. the ir would show both the carbonyl and o-h. but the nmr 10.5 ppm would then be the hydroxyl, which would exchange. however, in the nmr, if recorded in d2o, the hydroxyl would be suppressed. alternatively, maybe the compound is a lactone. then the 10.5 ppm could be an endo proton. but that's usually around 4-5 ppm. alternatively, perhaps the compound is a ortho-nitrophenoxide, but that's speculative. given that this is getting too convoluted, perhaps i should look at the answer choices. but since they aren't provided, i need to proceed. alternatively, maybe x is a cinnamic acid derivative. for example, if x is 4-hydroxy cinnamic acid, the structure would be: ph-cooh with a hydroxyl and a double bond. the ir would show o-h (broad), carbonyl (1720), and c=c (1610). the nmr would have a broad peak from the cooh (10.5 ppm), a peak from the c=c proton (maybe around 7.2-8.0 as multiplets), but that doesn't fit the data. alternatively, maybe x is a ester of a substituted benzoic acid. for example, phenyl acetate would have an ester carbonyl at 1720 cm-1, aromatic rings, and the nmr would have a singlet for the methyl group. but where's the 10.5 ppm? alternatively, maybe x is a amide. then the carbonyl would be around 1720, but the nmr would have an nh group. but the 10.5 ppm is too high for an amide proton, unless it's in a specific environment. alternatively, perhaps the compound is a aryl nitrile. the nitrile would have a c≡n around 2200 cm-1 (not present in ir data given). alternatively, maybe x is a acid anhydride. but those have two carbonyls, and the nmr would have different shifts. alternatively, maybe the problem has a typo. if the nmr peak is 10.5 ppm for the aldehyde, and other signals at 8.0 and 7.2 for the aromatic protons, then the structure could be 4-substituted benzaldehyde. the splitting suggests that the aromatic protons next to the substituent are deshielded. for example, if there is an electron-withdrawing group at position 4, the protons at positions 2 and 3 would be deshielded and split as doublets. the substituent at position 4 could be another group like a nitro or carbonyl. wait, but the ir shows a carbonyl at 1720 cm-1, so perhaps the substituent is an ester. so the compound could be 4-estherbenzaldehyde? that seems complex. alternatively, maybe x is a molecule where the aldehyde is ortho to an ester group. then the ester's carbonyl is at 1720, and the aldehyde is at 10.5 ppm (but aldehydes are around 10 ppm). the aromatic protons adjacent to both the aldehyde and ester would be split. however, such a structure might not be stable. alternatively, maybe x is a benzaldehyde with an acetyl group attached meta. the acetyl group would give the carbonyl at 1720. but the nmr splitting is two doublets. alternatively, considering all this confusion, maybe the correct approach is to recognize that the reaction with red phosphorus and hi is indicative of a substitution reaction. for example, if x is an aryl halide, then treatment with red phosphorus and excess hi would perform a substitution (wagner-meerwein rearrangement?), but more likely, it's a swern oxidation or some other reaction. wait, but red p and hi is used in the phosphoryl chloride exchange or in the conversion of chlorides to iodides (finkelstein reaction). if x is an aryl chloride, then treatment with red phosphorus and hi would convert it to aryl iodide. but in that case, the starting material would be an aryl halide. but x's ir shows a carbonyl at 1720 cm-1, so x isn't just an aryl halide. alternatively, if x is an aryl ester, then treating with hi would hydrolyze it to carboxylic acid. but how? alternatively, perhaps x is an aryl thioester. treatment with hi could convert it to a different ester. alternatively, the reaction might be a nucleophilic substitution on the carbonyl. for example, if x is an acid chloride, then hi could nucleophilically attack, but acid chlorides react with hi to form hcl and iodoalkane. but x's ir has a carbonyl at 1720, which is more of an ester or ketone. if x is an ester, then hi would hydrolyze it to carboxylic acid and alcohol. but under what conditions? with red phosphorus, which is used as a catalyst in some reactions. for example, in the hell–volhard–zelinskyl reaction, red phosphorus and hi are used to convert a carboxylic acid to an acyl halide. but that requires cosh. alternatively, maybe x is a ketone, and the reaction converts it to an iodo compound. but ketones don't typically react with hi. alternatively, the reaction could be an example of the jones oxidation, but that uses cro3. alternatively, hi can add to alkenes in a hydroiodic acid reaction. if x has a c=c bond (as indicated by the 1610 cm-1 in ir), then hi could add across the double bond. but x is an aromatic compound, so the c=c is part of the aromatic ring, to which hi doesn't add. alternatively, the presence of red phosphorus might lead to the pinacol coupling or similar. alternatively, considering all the information, perhaps x is a aryl ester, and the reaction converts it to the corresponding aryl iodide. for example, if x is an aryl chloroformate, reacting with red phosphorus and hi would generate the aryl iodide. but this is speculative. alternatively, let's think of the options given. since the user says to select from a, b, c, d, which are likely structures. since the user hasn't provided the options, i need to make an educated guess. given that the reaction is with red phosphorus and hi, common transformations include converting chlorides to iodides, or substituting leaving groups. if x has a carbonyl and an aromatic ring, the final product might be an aryl iodide. for example, if x is an aryl ester (like methyl benzoate), then treatment with hi and red p would hydrolyze the ester to benzoic acid and then possibly convert it to an aryl iodide. but how? alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, where a leaving group (like a tosyl group) is replaced by iodide. but x's ir doesn't show a sulfonate group. alternatively, if x is an aryl ketone, reacting with hi and red phosphorus might perform something like the ritter reaction (but that uses aqueous h2so4). alternatively, maybe the reaction is a radical halogenation. but red phosphorus can be used to reduce halogens. alternatively, the problem might be about the reimer-tiemann reaction, but that forms phenolic compounds. alternatively, considering the nmr data: the two aromatic singlets (8.0 and 7.2) each integrating to 2h, and the coupling (doublets) suggest that each pair of protons is next to each other and split only by protons on one adjacent position. this would occur in a 1,4-dichlorobenzene structure, but with substituents. alternatively, if x is terephthalic acid (benzene with two cooh groups at para positions), but the nmr doesn't fit. alternatively, if x is 4-acetylbenzoic acid, then the ir would have a carbonyl at around 1720 (for the ketone) and 1710 (for the carboxylic acid). but the nmr would have two carbonyls, and the 10.5 ppm would be one of them. but in this case, the aliphatic proton next to the carbonyl (if any) could be around 2.5 ppm. alternatively, maybe x is methyl 4-acylbenzoate. then the carbonyl would be present, and the ester carbonyl as well. but this is getting too complicated. given the lack of answer choices, it's challenging, but based on the reaction conditions (red phosphorus and hi), common products are aryl iodides (from chlorides via finkelstein), or products of substitution reactions. if x is an aryl chloride with a carbonyl group (like acetophenone chloride), then treatment with hi and red p would convert the chloride to iodide, giving acetophenone iodide. but such compounds are rare. alternatively, if x is an aryl ketone, and the reaction adds hi. for example, the ketone converts to an iodo compound. wait, but ketones don't typically react with hi. alternatively, maybe the reaction is an example of the hofmann degradation of an amide, but there's no amide peak. alternatively, considering that the nmr shows an integrated singlet of 1h at 10.5 ppm, which might be a conjugated dienophile. alternatively, the reaction could be a prins reaction, but with hi? alternatively, maybe the compound undergoes iodination at the para position. if the starting material is a substituted benzene with a hydroxyl group and a carbonyl, then treatment with hi and red phosphorus might iodinate the ring. but without knowing the options, it's hard. given the multiple dead-ends, perhaps the correct answer is that the product is 4-iodobenzoic acid. the reasoning is: x is a 4-substituted benzoic acid (cooh group and another substituent). the ir shows carbonyl (cooh at 1720 cm-1?), o-h stretching (broad around 3400–2500 cm-1), and aromatic c=c. the nmr shows the cooh proton (10.5 ppm), two sets of aromatic protons (doublets at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm), and possibly the substituent is a group that can be replaced by iodine. reacting with red phosphorus and hi would substitute the leaving group (e.g., a sulfonate group) with iodine, producing 4-iodobenzoic acid. however, the ir doesn't show a sulfonate group. alternatively, if the substituent is a nitro group, which can be reduced to an amine and then substituted. but this is unclear. alternatively, if the substituent is a chloride, then with red p and hi, it would convert to iodide. so if x is 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the ir would have cooh (1720 cm-1?), but i'm not sure. alternatively, if x is methyl 4-iodobenzoate, but that doesn't fit the nmr. given the confusion, i need to take a step back. let's re-examine the given data: ir: 3400–2500 (broad, likely o-h or n-h), 1720 (carbonyl), 1610 and 1450 (aromatic). nmr: 10.5 (bs, 1h) – likely o-h (cooh) or aldehyde. aromatics at 8.0 (d, 2h) and 7.2 (d, 2h). the coupling suggests each proton is next to another substituent. so the aromatic ring has two substituents, each with adjacent protons. the substituents are at positions that make the protons doublets. for example, if there's a substituent at position 1 and another at position 4, then the protons at positions 2, 3, 5, 6 would be split. but if substituents are at 1 and 3, the splitting would be different. alternatively, substituents at 1 and 2 (ortho) would cause the remaining protons to couple as doublets. but in that case, there would be more than two protons. but the nmr shows 2 sets of doublets: 8.0 (2h) and 7.2 (2h), so there must be two substituents, each with adjacent protons. the most plausible is a para-substituted benzene with substituents at 1 and 4. then the protons at 2 & 3 and 5 & 6 would each be doublets. but in that case, their shifts would depend on the nature of the substituents. now, the carbonyl at 1720 is likely an ester. if x is methyl 4-substituted benzoate, then the ir matches. the nmr would have the ester's methyl group around 3.7 ppm (but that's not mentioned). alternatively, if x is a different ester. but the 10.5 ppm doesn't fit an ester. alternatively, maybe the carbonyl is a ketone. then x is 4-alkylbenzene-carbonitrile? not sure. alternatively, if x is 4-acetylbenzoic acid, then the carbonyl would be the ketone (1720 cm-1) and cooh at 1710 cm-1), but the nmr would have two carbonyl regions. the 10.5 ppm would be the cooh. but the coupling of the aromatic protons would need to match. alternatively, the answer is that x is converted into 4-iodoacetophenone. but without knowing the options, it's hard. given that the reaction is with hi and red phosphorus, a common transformation is the conversion of a chloroarene into an iodoarene. but if x is an ester or has a leaving group, the reaction might replace that. for example, if x is methyl 4-chlorobenzoate, reacting with red p and hi would convert the chloride to iodide, forming methyl 4-iodobenzoate. the final product would then be a methyl benzoate ester with an iodide substituent. but how does that align with the nmr and ir? alternatively, if x is an aryl sulfonate, which is a good leaving group. treatment with hi and red p would replace the sulfonate with iodide. suppose x is p-toluenesulfonate... but this is unclear. considering all the uncertainty and potential for multiple wrong paths, i need to make an educated guess. given the reaction conditions (red phosphorus and hi), the reaction is likely a substitution where a leaving group on an aromatic ring is replaced by iodine. the starting material x has a carbonyl group (maybe an ester), a broad o-h stretch (suggesting a hydroxyl or carboxylic acid), and aromatic rings. the nmr shows an aldehyde proton (10.5 ppm) or a cooh proton. if x is a 4-substituted benzoic acid with another substituent that's a good leaving group (like a tosyl group), the reaction replaces that substituent with iodine, forming 4-iodobenzoic acid. the ir matches with cooh (1720 cm-1) and o-h (broad). however, cooh is usually around 1710, so maybe the 1720 is an ester. if x is methyl 4-hydroxybenzoate, the ir would show both o-h and ester carbonyl. the nmr would have the ester methyl group, but it's not mentioned. alternatively, if x is 4-formylbenzoic acid (although that would have two carbonyls), but that's unlikely. given the lack of progress, and considering common exam problems, the answer might be that the product is 4-iodobenzoic acid. thus, after reacting with red p and hi, the leaving group (e.g., chloride) is replaced by iodine. therefore, the final answer is \boxed{d} (assuming d is 4-iodobenzoic acid). however, without options, this is a guess. but since the user specified to think step by step, here's the summary: after analyzing the ir (broad o-h, ester/carbonyl at 1720, aromatic), nmr (10.5 ppm bs, 8.0 and 7.2 aromatic doublets), and reaction conditions (red p and hi), the structure of x is deduced to be a 4-substituted benzoic acid or ester with a leaving group. the reaction replaces the leaving group with iodine, producing 4-iodobenzoic acid or a similar iodo-substituted aromatic carboxylic acid. given the options would likely include such a structure, the answer is \boxed{d}. however, since the actual options aren't provided, this is based on common problem types.

answer: to solve this problem, we need to determine the structure of compound x based on its spectroscopic data and infer the product formed upon reaction with red phosphorus and hi. 

### key analysis:
1. **ir spectroscopy**:
   - **3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad)**: suggests an o-h stretch, indicative of a hydroxyl or carboxylic acid group.
   - **1720 cm⁻¹**: carbonyl stretch, typical of an ester or ketone.
   - **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹**: characteristic of aromatic c=c stretching modes.

2. **nmr spectroscopy**:
   - **10.5 ppm (bs, 1h)**: likely a broad singlet, possibly due to a cooh group (though typically higher ppm) or an aldehyde proton.
   - **8.0 ppm (d, 2h)** and **7.2 ppm (d, 2h)**: aromatic protons split into doublets, indicating symmetry and neighboring substituents. this splitting suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring with two substituents causing adjacent proton coupling.

3. **reaction conditions**:
   - **red phosphorus and hi**: commonly used in nucleophilic aromatic substitutions, particularly for converting good leaving groups (like to<conclusion>
