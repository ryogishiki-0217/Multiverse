Okay, so I need to solve this physics problem about time dilation due to traveling at a high speed.
Let me start by understanding the question.
We have aliens with an average lifetime of 150 years, but the specific question is about a 22-year-old astronaut traveling to Earth in a spaceship going at 0.99999987 times the speed of light.
We need to figure out how long the trip takes from the astronaut's perspective, and choose the answer from the given options.
First, this is a relativity problem, specifically involving time dilation as described by special relativity.
When an object moves at a speed close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs, meaning that time passes differently for the moving observer (the astronaut) compared to a stationary observer (someone on Earth).
The distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud needs to be determined.
The Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, located at a distance of approximately 160,000 light-years from Earth.
So the distance is about 160,000 light-years.
Wait, but the problem says the Large Magellanic Cloud, so that distance is correct.
So, the distance (d) is approximately 160,000 light-years.
The speed (v) of the spacecraft is 0.99999987c.
We need to compute the time experienced by the astronaut, which is proper time (τ), from their perspective.
In special relativity, the proper time is related to the coordinate time (t) observed by a stationary observer by the Lorentz factor (γ), which is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).
The formula for proper time is τ = t / γ.
But wait, actually, the time measured by the astronaut (τ) is given by τ = t * sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)), which is equivalent.
Let's verify.
Yes, the time dilation formula is Δτ = Δt * sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).
So Δt is the time in the Earth's frame (or the stationary frame), and Δτ is the time in the spaceship frame.
But first, we need to find Δt, the time it takes to travel 160,000 light-years from Earth's perspective.
Then, compute Δτ using the formula.
Wait, but the problem is asking for the time from the astronaut's point of view, so we need to compute Δτ.
Alternatively, we can compute the distance in the spaceship's frame, which is contracted, and then compute the time.
Hmm, two ways to do this.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: The time for the journey as observed from Earth (Δt).
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: The proper time (Δτ) experienced by the astronaut using the time dilation formula.
</Outline>
<Outline>
3: The proper time (Δτ) experienced by the astronaut using the length contraction formula.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The time for the journey as observed from Earth (Δt) is calculated by dividing the distance by the speed. The distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately 160,000 light-years, and the speed of the spacecraft is 0.99999987c. The time Δt is therefore 160,000 light-years divided by 0.99999987c. The speed is very close to c, so the division is nearly 160,000 divided by 1, which is approximately 160,000 years. To compute this more accurately, Δt = 160,000 / 0.99999987. The value of 0.99999987 is equivalent to 1 - 1.3 x 10^-7 (since 1 - 0.99999987 = 0.00000013, which is 1.3e-7). Thus, Δt ≈ 160,000 / (1 - 1.3e-7). Using the approximation 1/(1 - x) ≈ 1 + x for small x, Δt ≈ 160,000 * (1 + 1.3e-7). This evaluates to approximately 160,000 + 160,000 * 1.3e-7. The term 160,000 * 1.3e-7 is 160,000 * 0.00000013, which is 0.0208 years, or about 7.58 days. Therefore, Δt is approximately 160,000.0208 years, which is roughly 160,000 years, with a negligible additional fraction. The journey takes approximately 160,000 years from Earth's perspective.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The time experienced by the astronaut (Δτ) is then calculated using the time dilation formula: Δτ = Δt * sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).
</Path>
<Path>
3: The proper time can also be calculated using the formula Δτ = (d / v) * sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)), which combines the Earth frame time (d/v) with time dilation. This approach is considered for its potential utility.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The time for the journey as observed from Earth (Δt) is approximately 160,000 years. The proper time (Δτ) experienced by the astronaut can be calculated using either the time dilation formula (Δτ = Δt * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)) or the length contraction formula (Δτ = (d')/v, where d' is the contracted distance).

Compute the Lorentz factor (γ).
But first, let's compute 1 - (v^2/c^2).
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>

1: The value of (v/c) as a decimal.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: The value of (v/c)^2 as a decimal.

1: The speed v is given as 0.99999987c, meaning v/c = 0.99999987. The term (v/c) is therefore 0.99999987.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The square of (v/c) is calculated as (0.99999987)^2. The value 0.99999987 can be expressed as 1 - 1.3e-7. Squaring this value gives (1 - 1.3e-7)^2, which expands to 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2. The term 2*(1.3e-7) evaluates to 2.6e-7. The term (1.3e-7)^2 evaluates to 1.69e-14. Therefore, (v/c)^2 ≈ 1 - 2.6e-7 + 1.69e-14. The term 1.69e-14 is significantly smaller than 2.6e-7, so for a first approximation, (v/c)^2 ≈ 1 - 2.6e-7.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The value of (v/c) is 0.99999987. The value of (v/c)^2 is approximately 1 - 2.6e-7.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Therefore, 1 - (v^2/c^2) ≈ 2.6e-7 - 1.69e-14 ≈ 2.6e-7 (since 1.69e-14 is negligible compared to 2.6e-7).
Therefore, sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) ≈ sqrt(2.6e-7).
Let's compute sqrt(2.6e-7).
First, 2.6e-7 = 2.6 x 10^-7.
sqrt(2.6) is approx 1.612, and sqrt(10^-7) = 10^(-3.5) = 10^(-3) * 10^(-0.5) ≈ 0.001 / 3.162 ≈ 0.0003162.
Therefore, sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 1.612 * 0.0003162 ≈ 0.000509.
So sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) ≈ 0.000509.
So now, Δτ ≈ 160,000 years * 0.000509 ≈ 160,000 * 0.0005 ≈ 80, plus 160,000 * 0.000009 ≈ 1.44.
So total Δτ ≈ 80 + 1.44 ≈ 81.44 years.
Alternatively, 0.000509 * 160,000:
Let me compute that more accurately.
0.000509 * 160,000:
Multiply 509e-6 * 160e3 = (509 * 160) * 1e-3
509 * 160: Calculate 500*160=80,000 and 9*160=1,440, total 81,440.
So 81,440 * 1e-3 = 81.44 years.
So Δτ ≈ 81.44 years.
The astronaut is 22 years old at the start, so their age upon arrival would be 22 + 81.44 ≈ 103.44 years.
But the average lifetime is 150 years, so the astronaut would live well within their lifetime.
Therefore, the answer should be around 81 years.
Looking at the options, B) 81 years and D) 77 years are close.
But 81 is closer to our estimate.
Wait, but let me check the exact calculation.
Wait, maybe my approximation of sqrt(2.6e-7) as 0.000509 is a bit rough.
Let me compute it more precisely.
2.6e-7 is equal to 2.6 x 10^-7.
Taking square root:
sqrt(2.6) is approximately 1.61245, sqrt(10^-7) is 10^(-3.5) = approx 3.1623e-4.
So sqrt(2.6e-7) = 1.61245 * 3.1623e-4 ≈ let's compute that.
1.61245 * 3.1623 ≈ 1.6 * 3.16 is 5.056, plus 0.1245*3.1623 ≈ 0.1245*3 ≈ 0.3735, total ≈ 5.056 + 0.3735 ≈ 5.4295.
Wait, no.
Wait, 1.61245 * 3.1623e-4.
First compute 1.61245 * 3.1623:
Multiply 1.61245 by 3: 4.83735
Multiply 1.61245 by 0.1623: 1.61245 * 0.1 ≈ 0.161245, 1.61245 * 0.06 ≈ 0.096747, 1.61245 * 0.0023 ≈ 0.003709, total ≈ 0.161245 + 0.096747 + 0.003709 ≈ 0.2617.
So total is 4.83735 + 0.2617 ≈ 5.09905.
Therefore, 1.61245 * 3.1623 ≈ 5.09905.
Therefore, 1.61245 * 3.1623e-4 ≈ 5.09905e-4 ≈ 0.000509905.
So sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 0.000509905.
Therefore, multiplying by 160,000:
160,000 * 0.000509905 ≈ 160 * 0.509905 ≈ 81.5848 years.
So approximately 81.58 years, which rounds to 81.6 years.
So about 81.6 years.
The answer options have B) 81 years and D) 77 years.
So 81 years is closer, but perhaps my calculation of the distance was approximate.
Wait, maybe the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud is exactly known?
Let me check the actual distance.
The Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately 163,000 light-years away.
If it's 163,000 instead of 160,000, that would affect the calculation.
Let's see:
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: The proper time (Δτ) experienced by the astronaut when the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is 163,000 light-years.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: The effect of potential rounding in the speed value (0.99999987c) on the calculated proper time (Δτ).
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The proper time (Δτ) is recalculated using a distance of 163,000 light-years. The time experienced by the astronaut is given by the formula Δτ = d / v * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). Substituting the values, Δτ = 163,000 / 0.99999987 * sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2). The term 163,000 / 0.99999987 is approximately 163,000 * (1 + 1.3e-7), which equals approximately 163,000 + 163,000 * 1.3e-7. The term 163,000 * 1.3e-7 is approximately 21.19 days, or 0.058 years. The value of d / v is therefore approximately 163,000.058 years. The term sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2) is calculated as sqrt(1 - 0.99999974) = sqrt(2.6e-7), which is approximately 0.0005099. The proper time Δτ is then calculated as 163,000.058 * 0.0005099, which is approximately 163,000 * 0.0005099 = 83.32. The product of 0.0005099 * 0.058 is approximately 0.000030. The total Δτ is therefore approximately 83.32 + 0.003 ≈ 83.32 years.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The problem statement specifies a speed of 0.99999987c, which is extremely close to the speed of light. The precise value is significant because even small differences in speed at this magnitude can result in noticeable changes in the Lorentz factor and thus the calculated proper time. A more exact calculation of the Lorentz factor and its inverse square root, sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), is therefore necessary. The speed v is given as 0.99999987c. The exact value of v/c is 0.99999987. The term (v/c)^2 is then (0.99999987)^2. The expression 0.99999987 can be represented as 1 - 1.3e-7. Squaring this value yields (1 - 1.3e-7)^2, which expands to 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2. The term 2*(1.3e-7) evaluates to 2.6e-7. The term (1.3e-7)^2 evaluates to 1.69e-14. Therefore, (v/c)^2 is approximately 1 - 2.6e-7 + 1.69e-14. The value of 1 - (v/c)^2, which is approximately 2.6e-7 - 1.69e-14. This simplifies to approximately 2.6e-7, as the term 1.69e-14 is significantly smaller than 2.6e-7. The square root of this value, sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), is therefore approximately sqrt(2.6e-7). The value 2.6e-7 is equivalent to 2.6 multiplied by 10^-7. The square root of this is sqrt(2.6) multiplied by 10^(-3.5). The square root of 2.6 is approximately 1.61245, and 10^(-3.5) is approximately 3.1623e-4. Multiplying these together gives 1.61245 * 3.1623e-4, which is approximately 5.09905e-4 or 0.000509905. The calculation of the proper time Δτ is then performed using the formula Δτ = 160,000 years * 0.000509905, resulting in approximately 81.5848 years.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
Using a more precise distance of 163,000 light-years results in a proper time (Δτ) of approximately 83.32 years. The potential impact of the speed value being rounded to 0.99999987c on the calculation of Δτ was also considered.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Wait, but the speed given is 0.99999987c.
Let me check 0.99999987 squared.
Let me compute (1 - 1.3e-7)^2:
1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2.6e-7 + 1.69e-14.
Therefore, 1 - v2/c2 = 1 - (1 - 2.6e-7 + 1.69e-14) = 2.6e-7 - 1.69e-14 ≈ 2.6e-7.
So sqrt(2.6e-7).
So 2.6e-7 = 2.6 x 10^-7.
Take square root: sqrt(2.6) is approx 1.61245, and sqrt(10^-7) is 10^(-3.5) ≈ 3.1623e-4.
So multiplying those: 1.61245 * 3.1623e-4 ≈ 5.099e-4 = 0.0005099.
So yes, that gives us 0.0005099.
Therefore, Δτ ≈ 160,000 * 0.0005099 ≈ 160,000 * 0.0005 = 80, plus 160,000 * 0.0000099 ≈ 15.84.
So total ≈ 80 + 15.84 ≈ 95.84.
Wait, that contradicts earlier.
Wait no, wait 0.0005099 is equal to 5.099e-4.
So 160,000 * 5.099e-4.
Multiplying 160,000 by 5.099e-4:
160,000 = 1.6e5.
1.6e5 * 5.099e-4 = (1.6 * 5.099) * (1e5 * e-4) = 8.1584 * 10 = 81.584.
So exactly 81.584 years.
So approximately 81.6 years.
So the answer is 81.6 years, which is approximately 81 years.
So option B) 81 years.
But the given options are A)72, B)81, C)The astronaut will die, D)77.
But wait, if the calculation gives about 81.6 years, but the lifetime is 150 years, so the astronaut would be 22 + 81.6 = 103.6 years old, which is under 150, so they would live.
So the answer is 81 years, which is option B.
But wait, let's check if the speed is 0.99999987c, which is extremely close to c.
Wait, maybe I made an error in the calculation of sqrt(1 - v2/c2).
Let me re-express.
v = 0.99999987c, so v/c = 0.99999987.
Then, 1 - (v/c)^2 = 1 - (0.99999987)^2.
Let me calculate this more accurately.
Let's compute (0.99999987)^2.
Let me denote x = 0.99999987.
Then, x = 1 - 0.00000013.
Therefore, x2 = (1 - 0.00000013)^2 = 1 - 2*(0.00000013) + (0.00000013)^2 = 1 - 0.00000026 + 0.00000000000169.
Therefore, 1 - x2 = 1 - (1 - 0.00000026 + 0.00000000000169) = 0.00000026 - 0.00000000000169 ≈ 0.000000259831.
So 1 - (v/c)^2 ≈ 2.59831 x 10^-7.
Therefore, sqrt(1 - v2/c2) ≈ sqrt(2.59831e-7) ≈ 5.09739e-4 ≈ 0.000509739.
Thus, Δτ ≈ 160,000 * 0.000509739 ≈ 81.558 years.
So approximately 81.56 years.
Still, around 81.6 years.
So answer B) 81 years is the closest.
But wait, the options are A)72, B)81, C)The astronaut will die, D)77.
But according to the calculation, it's approximately 81.6 years, so 81 years.
So answer B.
But wait, let me check another approach.
Alternatively, using length contraction.
From the astronaut's perspective, the distance to Earth is contracted.
The distance d' = d * sqrt(1 - v2/c2).
So the time experienced by the astronaut is (d * sqrt(1 - v2/c2)) / v.
So same result.
Let's compute that.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: The contracted distance (d') from the astronaut's perspective.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: The proper time (Δτ) experienced by the astronaut using the length contraction method.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (d) is 160,000 light-years. The speed (v) is 0.99999987c. The Lorentz factor (γ) is approximately 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), which is approximately 1 / 0.0005099 ≈ 1965. The contracted distance (d') is calculated as d / γ, where d is the distance in light-years and γ is the Lorentz factor. The contracted distance is 160,0.081 light-years, calculated as 160,000 light-years multiplied by 0.0005099.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The proper time Δτ is calculated using the length contraction method as Δτ = d' / v. The contracted distance d' is 80,000 light-years, and the speed v is 0.99999987c. The time Δτ is therefore 80,000 light-years divided by 0.99999987c, which is approximately 80,000 / 0.999999999987. This division is nearly 80,000 / 1, resulting in approximately 80,000 years.
The value of 1 / 0.99999987 is approximately 1.00000013, leading to a more precise calculation of Δτ as 80,000 * 1.00000013.
The term 80,000 * 0.00000013 is approximately 0.0104 years, or about 3.8 days.
The total proper time Δτ is thus approximately 80,000.0104 years.
This result is not consistent with previous calculations based on time dilation.
A re-evaluation of the length contraction method is necessary.
The original distance d is 160,000 light-years.
The contracted distance d' is calculated as d' = d * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2).
The value of sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) is approximately 0.0005099.
The contracted distance d' is therefore approximately 160,000 * 0.0005099 light-years.
This calculation yields approximately 81.584 light-years.
The time experienced by the astronaut Δτ is then d' / v, which is 81.584 light-years divided by 0.99999987c.
The time Δτ is approximately 81.584 / 0.99999987 years.
The value of 81.584 / 0.99999987 is approximately 81.584 * (1 + 1.3e-7).
This product is approximately 81.584 + 81.584 * 1.3e-7.
The term 81.584 * 1.3e-7 is approximately 0.00106 years, or about 19 minutes.
The total Δτ is therefore approximately 81.584 + 0.00106 ≈ 81.585 years.
This result is consistent with the time dilation calculation.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The contracted distance (d') from the astronaut's perspective is approximately 81.584 light-years. The proper time (Δτ) experienced by the astronaut, calculated using the length contraction method, is approximately 81.585 years.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So same result.
So regardless of the method, the answer is approximately 81.6 years.
But the options are 72, 81, 77, etc.
So answer B) 81 years.
But wait, the options are given as:
A) 72 years
B) 81 years
C) The astronaut will die before reaching to the Earth.
D) 77 years
So 81 years is option B.
But according to the calculation, the time is about 81.6 years.
The astronaut is 22 years old at the start, so upon arrival, their age would be 22 + 81.6 ≈ 103.6 years.
The average lifetime is 150 years, so the astronaut would still have about 150 - 103.6 ≈ 46.4 years left.
So the correct answer is B) 81 years.
But why is option C there?
Maybe if the calculated time was more than 150-22=128 years, then the answer would be C.
But in our case, it's 81 years, so B.
Alternatively, maybe I messed up the calculation.
Let me check again.
Original distance: 160,000 ly.
Speed: 0.99999987c.
From Earth's frame, the travel time is 160,000 years / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 * 1.00000013... So coordinate time is approximately 160,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 160,000 + 160,000*0.00000013 ≈ 160,000 + 20.8 ≈ 160,020.8 years.
But from the astronaut's perspective, the time is dilated by gamma.
But wait, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v2/c2) ≈ 1 / 0.0005099 ≈ 1964.18.
Therefore, the proper time is coordinate time / gamma.
So 160,020.8 years / 1964.18 ≈ 81.584 years.
So 81.584 years, so answer B) 81 years.
But why is 77 years there?
If maybe I used incorrect distance, like 150,000 light-years.
Let me check.
If distance is 150,000 ly:
Δτ = 150,000 / 0.99999987 * sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2).
Same calculation:
150,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 150,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 150,000 + 150,000*0.00000013 ≈ 150,000 + 19.5 ≈ 150,019.5 years.
Then multiply by sqrt(1 - v2/c2) ≈ 0.0005099.
So 150,019.5 * 0.0005099 ≈ approx 150,000*0.0005099 = 76.4925, plus 19.5*0.0005099 ≈ 0.01, so total ≈ 76.50 years.
So ≈76.5 years, which is closest to 77 years (option D).
But the actual distance is 160,000 ly, not 150,000 ly.
So if the problem states 160,000 ly, answer is 81, but if it's typoed as 150,000, then answer is 77.
But the problem states the Large Magellanic Cloud, which is 160,000 ly.
Alternatively, maybe the speed is different?
Wait, the speed given is 0.99999987c.
If the speed is higher (closer to c), then time dilation is more significant.
Let me see.
For example, if speed is 0.999c, then gamma is about 22.36.
Let's compute sqrt(1 - (0.999)^2)) = sqrt(1 - 0.998001) = sqrt(0.001999) ≈ 0.0447.
So if speed is 0.999c, then sqrt(1 - v2/c2) = 0.0447.
But in our case, speed is 0.99999987c, which is v/c = 1 - 1.3e-7, as computed before, leading to sqrt(1 - v2/c2) ≈ 0.0005099.
Therefore, the numbers are correct.
Alternatively, maybe the problem is a trick question.
The average lifetime is 150 years, but the astronaut is 22 years old.
So time needed is 81.6 years; 22 +81.6 =103.6, which is less than 150.
Therefore, the answer is 81 years, and option C is wrong.
Therefore, the correct answer is B.
**Final Answer**
\boxed{B}
</Think>

Answer: The problem involves determining the time it takes for an astronaut traveling at a high speed (0.99999987c) from the Large Magellanic Cloud (approximately 160,000 light-years away) to reach Earth from the astronaut's perspective. This requires using the concept of time dilation in special relativity.

1. **Calculate the coordinate time (t) from the Earth's perspective:**
   \[
   t = \frac{\text{distance}}{v} = \frac{160,000 \text{ light-years}}{0.99999987c} \approx \frac{160,000}{0.99999987} \approx 160,000 \times 1.00000013 \approx 160,020.8 \text{ years}
   \]

2. **Determine the Lorentz factor (γ):**
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{v}{c}\right)^2}}
   \]
   Given \( v = 0.99999987c \):
   \[
   1 - \left(\frac{v}{c}\right)^2 = 1 - (0.99999987)^2 \approx 2.6 \times 10^{-7}
   \]
   \[
   \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{v}{c}\right)^2} \approx \sqrt{2.6 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 0.0005099
   \]
   \[
   \gamma \approx \frac{1}{0.0005099} \approx 1964.18
   \]

3. **Calculate the proper time (τ) from the astronaut's perspective:**
   \[
   \tau = \frac{t}{\gamma} = \frac{160,020.8}{1964.18} \approx 81.584 \text{ years}
   \]

4. **Consider the astronaut's age:**
   The astronaut is 22 years old at the start. Upon arrival, their age would be:
   \[
   22 + 81.584 \approx 103.584 \text{ years}
   \]
   Since the average lifetime is 150 years, the astronaut would survive the journey.

Thus, the approximate time from the astronaut's perspective is 81 years.

\[
\boxed{B}

okay, so i need to solve this physics problem about time dilation due to traveling at a high speed.
let me start by understanding the question.
we have aliens with an average lifetime of 150 years, but the specific question is about a 22-year-old astronaut traveling to earth in a spaceship going at 0.99999987 times the speed of light.
we need to figure out how long the trip takes from the astronaut's perspective, and choose the answer from the given options.
first, this is a relativity problem, specifically involving time dilation as described by special relativity.
when an object moves at a speed close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs, meaning that time passes differently for the moving observer (the astronaut) compared to a stationary observer (someone on earth).
the distance to the large magellanic cloud needs to be determined.
the large magellanic cloud is a satellite galaxy of the milky way, located at a distance of approximately 160,000 light-years from earth.
so the distance is about 160,000 light-years.
wait, but the problem says the large magellanic cloud, so that distance is correct.
so, the distance (d) is approximately 160,000 light-years.
the speed (v) of the spacecraft is 0.99999987c.
we need to compute the time experienced by the astronaut, which is proper time (τ), from their perspective.
in special relativity, the proper time is related to the coordinate time (t) observed by a stationary observer by the lorentz factor (γ), which is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).
the formula for proper time is τ = t / γ.
but wait, actually, the time measured by the astronaut (τ) is given by τ = t * sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)), which is equivalent.
let's verify.
yes, the time dilation formula is δτ = δt * sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).
so δt is the time in the earth's frame (or the stationary frame), and δτ is the time in the spaceship frame.
but first, we need to find δt, the time it takes to travel 160,000 light-years from earth's perspective.
then, compute δτ using the formula.
wait, but the problem is asking for the time from the astronaut's point of view, so we need to compute δτ.
alternatively, we can compute the distance in the spaceship's frame, which is contracted, and then compute the time.
hmm, two ways to do this.
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>
<goal>
<outline>
1: the time for the journey as observed from earth (δt).
</outline>
<outline>
2: the proper time (δτ) experienced by the astronaut using the time dilation formula.
</outline>
<outline>
3: the proper time (δτ) experienced by the astronaut using the length contraction formula.
</outline>
</goal>
<path>
1: the time for the journey as observed from earth (δt) is calculated by dividing the distance by the speed. the distance to the large magellanic cloud is approximately 160,000 light-years, and the speed of the spacecraft is 0.99999987c. the time δt is therefore 160,000 light-years divided by 0.99999987c. the speed is very close to c, so the division is nearly 160,000 divided by 1, which is approximately 160,000 years. to compute this more accurately, δt = 160,000 / 0.99999987. the value of 0.99999987 is equivalent to 1 - 1.3 x 10^-7 (since 1 - 0.99999987 = 0.00000013, which is 1.3e-7). thus, δt ≈ 160,000 / (1 - 1.3e-7). using the approximation 1/(1 - x) ≈ 1 + x for small x, δt ≈ 160,000 * (1 + 1.3e-7). this evaluates to approximately 160,000 + 160,000 * 1.3e-7. the term 160,000 * 1.3e-7 is 160,000 * 0.00000013, which is 0.0208 years, or about 7.58 days. therefore, δt is approximately 160,000.0208 years, which is roughly 160,000 years, with a negligible additional fraction. the journey takes approximately 160,000 years from earth's perspective.
</path>
<path>
2: the time experienced by the astronaut (δτ) is then calculated using the time dilation formula: δτ = δt * sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).
</path>
<path>
3: the proper time can also be calculated using the formula δτ = (d / v) * sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)), which combines the earth frame time (d/v) with time dilation. this approach is considered for its potential utility.
</path>
<conclusion>
the time for the journey as observed from earth (δt) is approximately 160,000 years. the proper time (δτ) experienced by the astronaut can be calculated using either the time dilation formula (δτ = δt * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)) or the length contraction formula (δτ = (d')/v, where d' is the contracted distance).
</conclusion>
</parallel>
compute the lorentz factor (γ).
but first, let's compute 1 - (v^2/c^2).
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>
<goal>
<outline>
1: the value of (v/c) as a decimal.
</outline>
<outline>
2: the value of (v/c)^2 as a decimal.
</outline>
</goal>
<path>
1: the speed v is given as 0.99999987c, meaning v/c = 0.99999987. the term (v/c) is therefore 0.99999987.
</path>
<path>
2: the square of (v/c) is calculated as (0.99999987)^2. the value 0.99999987 can be expressed as 1 - 1.3e-7. squaring this value gives (1 - 1.3e-7)^2, which expands to 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2. the term 2*(1.3e-7) evaluates to 2.6e-7. the term (1.3e-7)^2 evaluates to 1.69e-14. therefore, (v/c)^2 ≈ 1 - 2.6e-7 + 1.69e-14. the term 1.69e-14 is significantly smaller than 2.6e-7, so for a first approximation, (v/c)^2 ≈ 1 - 2.6e-7.
</path>
<conclusion>
the value of (v/c) is 0.99999987. the value of (v/c)^2 is approximately 1 - 2.6e-7.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
therefore, 1 - (v^2/c^2) ≈ 2.6e-7 - 1.69e-14 ≈ 2.6e-7 (since 1.69e-14 is negligible compared to 2.6e-7).
therefore, sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) ≈ sqrt(2.6e-7).
let's compute sqrt(2.6e-7).
first, 2.6e-7 = 2.6 x 10^-7.
sqrt(2.6) is approx 1.612, and sqrt(10^-7) = 10^(-3.5) = 10^(-3) * 10^(-0.5) ≈ 0.001 / 3.162 ≈ 0.0003162.
therefore, sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 1.612 * 0.0003162 ≈ 0.000509.
so sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) ≈ 0.000509.
so now, δτ ≈ 160,000 years * 0.000509 ≈ 160,000 * 0.0005 ≈ 80, plus 160,000 * 0.000009 ≈ 1.44.
so total δτ ≈ 80 + 1.44 ≈ 81.44 years.
alternatively, 0.000509 * 160,000:
let me compute that more accurately.
0.000509 * 160,000:
multiply 509e-6 * 160e3 = (509 * 160) * 1e-3
509 * 160: calculate 500*160=80,000 and 9*160=1,440, total 81,440.
so 81,440 * 1e-3 = 81.44 years.
so δτ ≈ 81.44 years.
the astronaut is 22 years old at the start, so their age upon arrival would be 22 + 81.44 ≈ 103.44 years.
but the average lifetime is 150 years, so the astronaut would live well within their lifetime.
therefore, the answer should be around 81 years.
looking at the options, b) 81 years and d) 77 years are close.
but 81 is closer to our estimate.
wait, but let me check the exact calculation.
wait, maybe my approximation of sqrt(2.6e-7) as 0.000509 is a bit rough.
let me compute it more precisely.
2.6e-7 is equal to 2.6 x 10^-7.
taking square root:
sqrt(2.6) is approximately 1.61245, sqrt(10^-7) is 10^(-3.5) = approx 3.1623e-4.
so sqrt(2.6e-7) = 1.61245 * 3.1623e-4 ≈ let's compute that.
1.61245 * 3.1623 ≈ 1.6 * 3.16 is 5.056, plus 0.1245*3.1623 ≈ 0.1245*3 ≈ 0.3735, total ≈ 5.056 + 0.3735 ≈ 5.4295.
wait, no.
wait, 1.61245 * 3.1623e-4.
first compute 1.61245 * 3.1623:
multiply 1.61245 by 3: 4.83735
multiply 1.61245 by 0.1623: 1.61245 * 0.1 ≈ 0.161245, 1.61245 * 0.06 ≈ 0.096747, 1.61245 * 0.0023 ≈ 0.003709, total ≈ 0.161245 + 0.096747 + 0.003709 ≈ 0.2617.
so total is 4.83735 + 0.2617 ≈ 5.09905.
therefore, 1.61245 * 3.1623 ≈ 5.09905.
therefore, 1.61245 * 3.1623e-4 ≈ 5.09905e-4 ≈ 0.000509905.
so sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 0.000509905.
therefore, multiplying by 160,000:
160,000 * 0.000509905 ≈ 160 * 0.509905 ≈ 81.5848 years.
so approximately 81.58 years, which rounds to 81.6 years.
so about 81.6 years.
the answer options have b) 81 years and d) 77 years.
so 81 years is closer, but perhaps my calculation of the distance was approximate.
wait, maybe the distance to the large magellanic cloud is exactly known?
let me check the actual distance.
the large magellanic cloud is approximately 163,000 light-years away.
if it's 163,000 instead of 160,000, that would affect the calculation.
let's see:
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>
<goal>
<outline>
1: the proper time (δτ) experienced by the astronaut when the distance to the large magellanic cloud (lmc) is 163,000 light-years.
</outline>
<outline>
2: the effect of potential rounding in the speed value (0.99999987c) on the calculated proper time (δτ).
</outline>
</goal>
<path>
1: the proper time (δτ) is recalculated using a distance of 163,000 light-years. the time experienced by the astronaut is given by the formula δτ = d / v * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). substituting the values, δτ = 163,000 / 0.99999987 * sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2). the term 163,000 / 0.99999987 is approximately 163,000 * (1 + 1.3e-7), which equals approximately 163,000 + 163,000 * 1.3e-7. the term 163,000 * 1.3e-7 is approximately 21.19 days, or 0.058 years. the value of d / v is therefore approximately 163,000.058 years. the term sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2) is calculated as sqrt(1 - 0.99999974) = sqrt(2.6e-7), which is approximately 0.0005099. the proper time δτ is then calculated as 163,000.058 * 0.0005099, which is approximately 163,000 * 0.0005099 = 83.32. the product of 0.0005099 * 0.058 is approximately 0.000030. the total δτ is therefore approximately 83.32 + 0.003 ≈ 83.32 years.
</path>
<path>
2: the problem statement specifies a speed of 0.99999987c, which is extremely close to the speed of light. the precise value is significant because even small differences in speed at this magnitude can result in noticeable changes in the lorentz factor and thus the calculated proper time. a more exact calculation of the lorentz factor and its inverse square root, sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), is therefore necessary. the speed v is given as 0.99999987c. the exact value of v/c is 0.99999987. the term (v/c)^2 is then (0.99999987)^2. the expression 0.99999987 can be represented as 1 - 1.3e-7. squaring this value yields (1 - 1.3e-7)^2, which expands to 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2. the term 2*(1.3e-7) evaluates to 2.6e-7. the term (1.3e-7)^2 evaluates to 1.69e-14. therefore, (v/c)^2 is approximately 1 - 2.6e-7 + 1.69e-14. the value of 1 - (v/c)^2, which is approximately 2.6e-7 - 1.69e-14. this simplifies to approximately 2.6e-7, as the term 1.69e-14 is significantly smaller than 2.6e-7. the square root of this value, sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), is therefore approximately sqrt(2.6e-7). the value 2.6e-7 is equivalent to 2.6 multiplied by 10^-7. the square root of this is sqrt(2.6) multiplied by 10^(-3.5). the square root of 2.6 is approximately 1.61245, and 10^(-3.5) is approximately 3.1623e-4. multiplying these together gives 1.61245 * 3.1623e-4, which is approximately 5.09905e-4 or 0.000509905. the calculation of the proper time δτ is then performed using the formula δτ = 160,000 years * 0.000509905, resulting in approximately 81.5848 years.
</path>
<conclusion>
using a more precise distance of 163,000 light-years results in a proper time (δτ) of approximately 83.32 years. the potential impact of the speed value being rounded to 0.99999987c on the calculation of δτ was also considered.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
wait, but the speed given is 0.99999987c.
let me check 0.99999987 squared.
let me compute (1 - 1.3e-7)^2:
1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2.6e-7 + 1.69e-14.
therefore, 1 - v2/c2 = 1 - (1 - 2.6e-7 + 1.69e-14) = 2.6e-7 - 1.69e-14 ≈ 2.6e-7.
so sqrt(2.6e-7).
so 2.6e-7 = 2.6 x 10^-7.
take square root: sqrt(2.6) is approx 1.61245, and sqrt(10^-7) is 10^(-3.5) ≈ 3.1623e-4.
so multiplying those: 1.61245 * 3.1623e-4 ≈ 5.099e-4 = 0.0005099.
so yes, that gives us 0.0005099.
therefore, δτ ≈ 160,000 * 0.0005099 ≈ 160,000 * 0.0005 = 80, plus 160,000 * 0.0000099 ≈ 15.84.
so total ≈ 80 + 15.84 ≈ 95.84.
wait, that contradicts earlier.
wait no, wait 0.0005099 is equal to 5.099e-4.
so 160,000 * 5.099e-4.
multiplying 160,000 by 5.099e-4:
160,000 = 1.6e5.
1.6e5 * 5.099e-4 = (1.6 * 5.099) * (1e5 * e-4) = 8.1584 * 10 = 81.584.
so exactly 81.584 years.
so approximately 81.6 years.
so the answer is 81.6 years, which is approximately 81 years.
so option b) 81 years.
but the given options are a)72, b)81, c)the astronaut will die, d)77.
but wait, if the calculation gives about 81.6 years, but the lifetime is 150 years, so the astronaut would be 22 + 81.6 = 103.6 years old, which is under 150, so they would live.
so the answer is 81 years, which is option b.
but wait, let's check if the speed is 0.99999987c, which is extremely close to c.
wait, maybe i made an error in the calculation of sqrt(1 - v2/c2).
let me re-express.
v = 0.99999987c, so v/c = 0.99999987.
then, 1 - (v/c)^2 = 1 - (0.99999987)^2.
let me calculate this more accurately.
let's compute (0.99999987)^2.
let me denote x = 0.99999987.
then, x = 1 - 0.00000013.
therefore, x2 = (1 - 0.00000013)^2 = 1 - 2*(0.00000013) + (0.00000013)^2 = 1 - 0.00000026 + 0.00000000000169.
therefore, 1 - x2 = 1 - (1 - 0.00000026 + 0.00000000000169) = 0.00000026 - 0.00000000000169 ≈ 0.000000259831.
so 1 - (v/c)^2 ≈ 2.59831 x 10^-7.
therefore, sqrt(1 - v2/c2) ≈ sqrt(2.59831e-7) ≈ 5.09739e-4 ≈ 0.000509739.
thus, δτ ≈ 160,000 * 0.000509739 ≈ 81.558 years.
so approximately 81.56 years.
still, around 81.6 years.
so answer b) 81 years is the closest.
but wait, the options are a)72, b)81, c)the astronaut will die, d)77.
but according to the calculation, it's approximately 81.6 years, so 81 years.
so answer b.
but wait, let me check another approach.
alternatively, using length contraction.
from the astronaut's perspective, the distance to earth is contracted.
the distance d' = d * sqrt(1 - v2/c2).
so the time experienced by the astronaut is (d * sqrt(1 - v2/c2)) / v.
so same result.
let's compute that.
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>
<goal>
<outline>
1: the contracted distance (d') from the astronaut's perspective.
</outline>
<outline>
2: the proper time (δτ) experienced by the astronaut using the length contraction method.

1: the distance to the large magellanic cloud (d) is 160,000 light-years. the speed (v) is 0.99999987c. the lorentz factor (γ) is approximately 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), which is approximately 1 / 0.0005099 ≈ 1965. the contracted distance (d') is calculated as d / γ, where d is the distance in light-years and γ is the lorentz factor. the contracted distance is 160,0.081 light-years, calculated as 160,000 light-years multiplied by 0.0005099.
</path>
<path>
2: the proper time δτ is calculated using the length contraction method as δτ = d' / v. the contracted distance d' is 80,000 light-years, and the speed v is 0.99999987c. the time δτ is therefore 80,000 light-years divided by 0.99999987c, which is approximately 80,000 / 0.999999999987. this division is nearly 80,000 / 1, resulting in approximately 80,000 years.
the value of 1 / 0.99999987 is approximately 1.00000013, leading to a more precise calculation of δτ as 80,000 * 1.00000013.
the term 80,000 * 0.00000013 is approximately 0.0104 years, or about 3.8 days.
the total proper time δτ is thus approximately 80,000.0104 years.
this result is not consistent with previous calculations based on time dilation.
a re-evaluation of the length contraction method is necessary.
the original distance d is 160,000 light-years.
the contracted distance d' is calculated as d' = d * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2).
the value of sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) is approximately 0.0005099.
the contracted distance d' is therefore approximately 160,000 * 0.0005099 light-years.
this calculation yields approximately 81.584 light-years.
the time experienced by the astronaut δτ is then d' / v, which is 81.584 light-years divided by 0.99999987c.
the time δτ is approximately 81.584 / 0.99999987 years.
the value of 81.584 / 0.99999987 is approximately 81.584 * (1 + 1.3e-7).
this product is approximately 81.584 + 81.584 * 1.3e-7.
the term 81.584 * 1.3e-7 is approximately 0.00106 years, or about 19 minutes.
the total δτ is therefore approximately 81.584 + 0.00106 ≈ 81.585 years.
this result is consistent with the time dilation calculation.
</path>
<conclusion>
the contracted distance (d') from the astronaut's perspective is approximately 81.584 light-years. the proper time (δτ) experienced by the astronaut, calculated using the length contraction method, is approximately 81.585 years.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
so same result.
so regardless of the method, the answer is approximately 81.6 years.
but the options are 72, 81, 77, etc.
so answer b) 81 years.
but wait, the options are given as:
a) 72 years
b) 81 years
c) the astronaut will die before reaching to the earth.
d) 77 years
so 81 years is option b.
but according to the calculation, the time is about 81.6 years.
the astronaut is 22 years old at the start, so upon arrival, their age would be 22 + 81.6 ≈ 103.6 years.
the average lifetime is 150 years, so the astronaut would still have about 150 - 103.6 ≈ 46.4 years left.
so the correct answer is b) 81 years.
but why is option c there?
maybe if the calculated time was more than 150-22=128 years, then the answer would be c.
but in our case, it's 81 years, so b.
alternatively, maybe i messed up the calculation.
let me check again.
original distance: 160,000 ly.
speed: 0.99999987c.
from earth's frame, the travel time is 160,000 years / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 * 1.00000013... so coordinate time is approximately 160,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 160,000 + 160,000*0.00000013 ≈ 160,000 + 20.8 ≈ 160,020.8 years.
but from the astronaut's perspective, the time is dilated by gamma.
but wait, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v2/c2) ≈ 1 / 0.0005099 ≈ 1964.18.
therefore, the proper time is coordinate time / gamma.
so 160,020.8 years / 1964.18 ≈ 81.584 years.
so 81.584 years, so answer b) 81 years.
but why is 77 years there?
if maybe i used incorrect distance, like 150,000 light-years.
let me check.
if distance is 150,000 ly:
δτ = 150,000 / 0.99999987 * sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2).
same calculation:
150,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 150,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 150,000 + 150,000*0.00000013 ≈ 150,000 + 19.5 ≈ 150,019.5 years.
then multiply by sqrt(1 - v2/c2) ≈ 0.0005099.
so 150,019.5 * 0.0005099 ≈ approx 150,000*0.0005099 = 76.4925, plus 19.5*0.0005099 ≈ 0.01, so total ≈ 76.50 years.
so ≈76.5 years, which is closest to 77 years (option d).
but the actual distance is 160,000 ly, not 150,000 ly.
so if the problem states 160,000 ly, answer is 81, but if it's typoed as 150,000, then answer is 77.
but the problem states the large magellanic cloud, which is 160,000 ly.
alternatively, maybe the speed is different?
wait, the speed given is 0.99999987c.
if the speed is higher (closer to c), then time dilation is more significant.
let me see.
for example, if speed is 0.999c, then gamma is about 22.36.
let's compute sqrt(1 - (0.999)^2)) = sqrt(1 - 0.998001) = sqrt(0.001999) ≈ 0.0447.
so if speed is 0.999c, then sqrt(1 - v2/c2) = 0.0447.
but in our case, speed is 0.99999987c, which is v/c = 1 - 1.3e-7, as computed before, leading to sqrt(1 - v2/c2) ≈ 0.0005099.
therefore, the numbers are correct.
alternatively, maybe the problem is a trick question.
the average lifetime is 150 years, but the astronaut is 22 years old.
so time needed is 81.6 years; 22 +81.6 =103.6, which is less than 150.
therefore, the answer is 81 years, and option c is wrong.
therefore, the correct answer is b.
**final answer**
\boxed{b}
</think>

answer: the problem involves determining the time it takes for an astronaut traveling at a high speed (0.99999987c) from the large magellanic cloud (approximately 160,000 light-years away) to reach earth from the astronaut's perspective. this requires using the concept of time dilation in special relativity.

1. **calculate the coordinate time (t) from the earth's perspective:**
   \[
   t = \frac{\text{distance}}{v} = \frac{160,000 \text{ light-years}}{0.99999987c} \approx \frac{160,000}{0.99999987} \approx 160,000 \times 1.00000013 \approx 160,020.8 \text{ years}
   \]

2. **determine the lorentz factor (γ):**
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{v}{c}\right)^2}}
   \]
   given \( v = 0.99999987c \):
   \[
   1 - \left(\frac{v}{c}\right)^2 = 1 - (0.99999987)^2 \approx 2.6 \times 10^{-7}
   \]
   \[
   \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{v}{c}\right)^2} \approx \sqrt{2.6 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 0.0005099
   \]
   \[
   \gamma \approx \frac{1}{0.0005099} \approx 1964.18
   \]

3. **calculate the proper time (τ) from the astronaut's perspective:**
   \[
   \tau = \frac{t}{\gamma} = \frac{160,020.8}{1964.18} \approx 81.584 \text{ years}
   \]

4. **consider the astronaut's age:**
   the astronaut is 22 years old at the start. upon arrival, their age would be:
   \[
   22 + 81.584 \approx 103.584 \text{ years}
   \]
   since the average lifetime is 150 years, the astronaut would survive the journey.

thus, the approximate time from the astronaut's perspective is 81 years.

\boxed{b}
