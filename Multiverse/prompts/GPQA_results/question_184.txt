<Think>
Okay, let's see. I need to figure out which sequence of reactions would lead to the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The target compound has three substituents on the benzene ring: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The positions are important too—tert-butyl at position 2, ethoxy at position 1 (which is adjacent to position 2), and nitro at position 3. So, the substituents are in a specific order around the ring.
First, I need to recall the basic aromatic substitution reactions and how directing groups work. Let's think about the substituents one by one.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: The initial introduction of the tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: The subsequent nitration of the substituted benzene.
</Outline>
<Outline>
3: The directing influence of the tert-butyl group on the nitro group's position.
</Outline>
<Outline>
4: The directing influence of the nitro group on the ethoxy group's position.
</Outline>
<Outline>
5: The introduction of the ethoxy group via nucleophilic aromatic substitution.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The tert-butyl group is introduced via Friedel-Crafts alkylation using tert-butyl chloride as the alkylating agent and AlCl3 as the catalyst. This substitution occurs at the para position relative to any existing substituents. If benzene is the starting material, the first substitution would be at the para position.
</Path>
<Path>
2: Nitration typically requires a strong nitrating agent, such as a mixture of concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) and concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4).
</Path>
<Path>
3: The tert-butyl group, being a strong activating and para/ortho-directing group, directs incoming substituents to the para and ortho positions relative to itself.
</Path>
<Path>
4: The presence of a nitro group, a strong deactivating and meta-directing substituent, would then direct the incoming ethoxy group to the meta position relative to the nitro group.
</Path>
<Path>
5: The ethoxy group is introduced through nucleophilic aromatic substitution. This involves the use of ethyl bromide (EtBr) in a basic condition, such as with sodium ethoxide (NaOEt), or more likely, in the presence of NaOH. The mechanism for this is typically a substitution where the nitro group directs the incoming ethoxide ion to the para position relative to itself. However, the existing tert-butyl group at the ortho position might influence the regioselectivity. The nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. If the nitro group is at position 3, the ethoxy group should ideally form at position 4 (relative to nitro), but the tert-butyl at position 2 might block that position, leading to a different outcome. Alternatively, the ethoxy group might enter at the ortho position relative to the nitro group, but steric hindrance from the tert-butyl group could prevent this. The exact regiochemistry here is a bit tricky. Perhaps the nitro group is directing substitution para to itself, but the tert-butyl group is in the way, so the ethoxy group goes to the next available position. Alternatively, the ethoxy group is introduced after hydrolysis of a sulfonic acid ester. Wait, one of the steps involves SO3/H2SO4, which is sulfonation. Sulfonic acid is a good leaving group under certain conditions. Maybe the sequence involves sulfonating the ring first, then substituting the sulfonic acid group with ethoxy under high temperature and acid conditions (Wurtz-Emmons reaction?), but that's used for rearrangements. Alternatively, maybe the sulfonic acid is replaced by ethoxide in a nucleophilic substitution. Let me think. Sulfonation is a reversible process. So, if you have a benzene ring with substituents, sulfonation occurs preferentially in a certain position. Then, if you treat it with dilute H2SO4 and heat, perhaps in the presence of acid, you can replace the sulfonic acid group with something else. But how does that relate to introducing ethoxy?
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The initial steps involve Friedel-Crafts alkylation to introduce the tert-butyl group, followed by nitration. The tert-butyl group directs incoming substituents to para/ortho positions, while the nitro group, once added, is a meta-directing group. The ethoxy group is introduced via nucleophilic substitution, potentially involving sulfonation and subsequent replacement of the sulfonic acid group.

Subsequently, a Sandmeyer-type reaction, such as treatment with Fe/HCl, replaces the nitro group with an amino group. A second nitration step then directs a second nitro group into the meta position relative to the amino group. Sulfonation using SO3/H2SO4 introduces a sulfonic acid group, which is subsequently replaced by an ethoxy group using NaOH/EtBr under acidic and heating conditions. The sulfonic acid group is then removed with dilute H2SO4.

<Conclusion>
The reaction sequences proposed by options A, B, C, and D were identified. These sequences involve various combinations of nitration, hydrogenation, Friedel-Crafts alkylation, sulfonation, diazotization, hydrolysis, and ethylation steps, with the specific order and details differing between the options.

Now, the target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's map out the positions. Let's number the benzene ring such that position 1 is the ethoxy group, position 2 is the tert-butyl group, and position 3 is the nitro group. So, substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. The benzene ring has six positions. So, the tert-butyl is adjacent to the ethoxy (positions 1 and 2) and the nitro is at position 3. So, the substituents are in a row: ethoxy, tert-butyl, nitro.
To achieve this, the synthesis would need to proceed in a way that each substituent is added in a position directed by the previous ones.

1: The initial step involves Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene with tert-butyl chloride, which introduces the tert-butyl group at the para position relative to any existing substituents. Since benzene is the starting material, this results in para-tert-butylbenzene.

5: Hydrolysis of the sulfonic acid group using H3O+ and H2O under heating conditions yields the benzene ring with an amino group and a hydroxyl group at positions para to each other.
</Path>
<Path>
6: The sulfonic acid group is then replaced by ethoxy in step vii. This replacement involves treating the sulfonic acid with NaOH and EtBr under high temperature and acidic conditions (H3O+). The sulfonic acid is a good leaving group and can depart, forming a carbocation. The ethoxide ion (from NaOH and EtBr) then attacks the carbocation to introduce the ethoxy group. The exact position of this substitution is determined by the existing substituents. The amino group at position 2 is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. The sulfonic acid group was at position 6 (assuming numbering where tert-butyl is 2, nitro is 3, sulfonic acid is 6). When the sulfonic acid is replaced by ethoxy, the ethoxy group would ideally go para to the amino group (position 4) or adjacent. However, positions 4 and 5 are already taken by the nitro and part of the ring. Wait, maybe my numbering is off. Let's re-examine. If we have tert-butyl at position 2, nitro at position 3, and amino at position 2 (after reduction), then the sulfonic acid would be at position 6. When substituting the sulfonic acid with ethoxide, the ethoxide would attack the carbocation formed at position 6. But the amino group at position 2 is activating, directing para/ortho. The ethoxide would want to add para to the amino (position 4) or ortho to the amino (positions 1 or 3). However, position 4 is occupied by the nitro group, and position 3 is the nitro. Position 1 is adjacent to tert-butyl. Wait, maybe the numbering is different. Let me try to draw this.
If we start with benzene, add tert-butyl at position 2, then nitro at position 3. Then, after reduction to amino, sulfonation occurs. Where does sulfonic acid add? The amino group (position 2) is strong activating, so sulfonic acid (electrophilic substitution) would add in the meta position relative to amino. That would be position 5. Then, replacing sulfonic acid at position 5 with ethoxy. But then ethoxy would be at position 5. But in the target molecule, ethoxy is at position 1. Hmm, this seems inconsistent. Alternatively, perhaps after adding tert-butyl and two nitro groups, the sulfonic acid is added in a certain position, then replaced by ethoxy. This is getting confusing. Let's check another approach. Maybe the correct sequence is option D.
</Path>
<Path>
7: The hydrogenation step converts the nitro group into an amino group.
</Path>
<Path>
8: The final nitration step in the sequence converts the amino group into a nitro group, yielding the target molecule, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The proposed sequence in option D involves Friedel-Crafts alkylation to introduce tert-butyl, followed by nitration, hydrogenation, a second nitration, a Sandmeyer-type reaction, sulfonation, hydrolysis, ethylation, and a final nitration. This sequence yields a product that matches the target structure of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, as the ethoxy group is correctly positioned at the site previously occupied by the sulfonic acid, and the final nitration regenerates the nitro group at the position initially introduced by the second nitration step.
</Conclusion>

Alternatively, option A: nitration, hydrogenation, Friedel-Crafts, nitration, diazotization, sulfonation, hydrolysis, acid hydrolysis, ethylation. This seems to have more steps and a different order.
Option B starts with Friedel-Crafts, then sulfonation, nitration, Fe/HCl (catalytic hydrogenation?), diazotization, nitration, acid hydrolysis, ethylation. The steps here might lead to the correct product. Let me walk through option B step by step.

<Conclusion>
Option B's proposed sequence of reactions begins with Friedel-Crafts alkylation to introduce the tert-butyl group, followed by sulfonation, nitration, catalytic hydrogenation, diazotization, a second nitration, and acid hydrolysis. The sequence concludes with the introduction of the ethoxy group, a process similar to that in option D.

If the sulfonic acid is at position 6, replacing it with ethoxy would place the ethoxy at position 6. But in the target molecule, ethoxy is at position 1. This might not align. Alternatively, the numbering in the product after the first steps could be different. Let's try to track positions step by step for option D. Option D steps: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts para tert-butylbenzene. ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Since tert-butyl is para, the nitro group would enter either meta to tert-butyl. Wait, but tert-butyl is activating, para/ortho-directing. Wait, nitration is a meta directing due to the deactivating effect, but wait, the substituent on the ring affects the directing. Wait, the tert-butyl group is a strong activating group (since it's a烷yl group), and it is para/ortho-directing. So when nitrating para-tert-butylbenzene, the nitro group should go meta to the tert-butyl group, because in meta position. Wait, no. Let me check: for monosubstituted benzene, the direction of incoming groups depends on the substituent's activating/deactivating and meta/para-ortho directing. Since tert-butyl is activating and para/ortho-directing, the nitro group (which is a meta director if the existing substituent is activating?) Wait, no. Let me recall: The nitration reaction is meta directed by deactivating, meta-directing groups and ortho/para by activating groups. Wait, no. Let me clarify: For nitration, the directing is as follows: - If the existing substituent is a deactivating meta-director (like nitro, sulfonic acid, etc.), then the nitro group will add meta to it. - If the existing substituent is activating (like methyl, tert-butyl, etc.), the nitro group will add para or ortho. Since the first substitution is tert-butyl (activating), the second substitution (nitration) will occur in para or ortho relative to tert-butyl. Since the tert-butyl is already in para position (relative to where else? If we started with benzene, after Friedel-Crafts, the tert-butyl is in one position. Then nitration would add in para or ortho. Wait, maybe the first substitution is in position 1 (tert-butyl), then the nitration could be in position 2 or position 4. But depending on the substitution. Alternatively, if we start with benzene, substitute tert-butyl in position 2, then nitrate in position 3. Wait, but how does that work? Let's clarify. Suppose we start with benzene. Step i) Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride. Since benzene is symmetric, the first substitution can be in any position. But subsequent steps depend on the direction. Wait, maybe the numbering in the target compound is such that the tert-butyl is in position 2, ethoxy in 1, and nitro in 3. So the ring has substituents in positions 1, 2, and 3. But benzene has six positions. So maybe the steps are: 1) Introduce tert-butyl at position 2. 2) Introduce nitro at position 3. 3) Perform some substitutions to get ethoxy at position 1. But how? Let's think again. Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence first installs the tert-butyl group, then adds a nitro group in the correct position, then reduces the nitro to amino, does sulfonation, replaces the sulfonic acid with ethoxy, and then re-nitrates. But in which order? Let's look at option D's steps: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts, giving para-tert-butylbenzene. ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. So now we have nitro in meta position relative to tert-butyl? No, since tert-butyl is activating, directing groups would add para or ortho. Wait, if we have tert-butyl in position 2, the next substitution (nitration) would be in position 3 (meta to tert-butyl)? But tert-butyl is a para/ortho director. Wait, this is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the nitration occurs in position 1, making a para nitro to the tert-butyl. Wait, let's imagine the benzene ring with tert-butyl in position 2. Then, positions 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 are available. Since tert-butyl is para/ortho director, the nitro would add in position 1 (ortho) or position 4 (para). But position 4 is two positions across. But if we add nitro in position 1 (ortho to tert-butyl), then the next steps need to add ethoxy in position 3. Alternatively, adding nitro in position 4 (para to tert-butyl), but then how would ethoxy get into position 1? Let me sketch this mentally. Suppose after step ii in option D, nitro is added in position 1 (ortho to tert-butyl in position 2). Then, after step iii) Fe/HCl, which is catalytic hydrogenation, reducing nitro to amino. So now we have amino in position 1 and tert-butyl in position 2. Step iv) HNO3/H2SO4: another nitration. Now, the amino group is activating, ortho/para-directing. So the nitro group would add para to amino (position 4) or ortho. But tert-butyl is in position 2, which is adjacent to position 1 (amino). Adding another nitro para to amino (position 4) would be possible. Then, step v) NaNO2/HCl: diazotization. This would convert maybe one of the amines? Wait, but we only have one amino group here. Wait, after the first reduction, we have an aniline (assuming nitro was reduced to amino). Then, if we nitrate again, adding another nitro group, perhaps in position 4. Then, step v) diazotization (assuming we have a primary amine). If the amino group is in position 1, then treatment with nitrous acid (NaNO2/HCl) would convert it into a diazonium salt. But if there are nitro groups adjacent, we need to ensure that the amino group can form a stable diazonium salt. Diazonium salts are formed from primary amines in acidic conditions. But nitro groups are strongly deactivating. If the amino is next to a nitro (as in position 1, with nitro in position 2 or 4), it might be more difficult to form the diazonium salt. However, if the amino is para to another nitro, that might be okay. Wait, maybe the sequence is different. Let me recap option D's steps: i) Friedel-Crafts with tert-butyl: benzene becomes para-tert-butylbenzene. ii) Nitration: adds nitro group. Since the tert-butyl is activating, the nitro would add in para or ortho. Let's say it adds in para. Wait, but para to tert-butyl would be the opposite position. But benzene has six positions. If the tert-butyl is in position 2, para would be position 6. Then nitro in position 6. Then reduction with Fe/HCl would give amino in position 6. Then next nitration would add nitro in position 5 (meta to amino)? Not sure. This is getting complicated. Let's consider the target structure: substituents at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So adjacent substituents: ethoxy in 1, tert-butyl in 2, nitro in 3. That's a consecutive sequence around the ring. To achieve this, the directing during each substitution step is critical. The first substitution is tert-butyl at position 2. How do we get that? If we start with benzene and do Friedel-Crafts alkylation, the first substitution can be anywhere, but subsequent steps would depend on that. Wait, but Friedel-Crafts is for activating groups, and the product is a mix, but perhaps the reaction is para-selective. Alternatively, maybe the synthesis uses a directed synthesis for the first substitution, but without specific directing groups, the first substitution is random. However, in a synthesis problem, we can assume that the first substitution occurs in a position that allows the following steps to place the other groups correctly. Alternatively, maybe the synthesis uses a different approach. Let's consider the steps in option D: D) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; vii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4 But wait, option D's steps: i) Friedel-Crafts with tert-butyl chloride → para tert-butylbenzene. ii) Nitration: adds nitro group. Assuming the nitro adds in para or ortho to tert-butyl. Let's say it adds in position 3 (ortho to tert-butyl in position 2). Then, after reduction with Fe/HCl (iii), we have an amino group in position 3. iv) Another nitration. Now, the amino group is activating, so the nitro would add para or ortho to amino. If amino is in position 3, adding nitro para would be position 6, ortho would be position 2 or 4. But position 2 is already occupied by tert-butyl, so para (position 6) is possible. Then, step v) diazotization (NaNO2/HCl) of the amino group in position 3. This would convert it into a diazonium group. Then, maybe vi) hydrolysis (H3O+/H2O/Heat) to remove the diazonium group (maybe to hydroxyl?). Wait, but under what conditions? Alternatively, if the diazonium salt is treated with water under acidic and heating conditions, it could undergo hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid. But that's not helpful. Wait, perhaps step vi) is supposed to remove the diazonium group. Alternatively, maybe steps vi) and vii) are related to introducing the ethoxy group. Alternatively, maybe after diazotization, the group is replaced. For example, step vi) might be a substitution of the diazonium group. Diazonium salts can undergo replacement reactions. For example, treatment with H3O+/heat could cause hydrolysis to a phenolic group, but if the diazonium is on a benzene ring with other electron-withdrawing groups, it might hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid. But we need to form ethoxy group. Wait, step vii) is NaOH/EtBr, which sounds like an SN2 reaction, maybe ethylation. But if the diazonium group is replaced by ethyl bromide under alkaline conditions? That could be a replacement. For example, Gattermann-Koch reaction replaces diazonium with hydrogen, but under different conditions, maybe other groups. Alternatively, the diazonium salt can be coupled with something that provides an ethoxy group. But I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe after the second nitration, the amino group is still present, and then steps vi) through vii) introduce the ethoxy group. But the sequence in option D is getting too long, and I'm losing track. Maybe I should look at the options' structures again. The key is that the target molecule has three substituents: 2-(tert-butyl), 1-ethoxy, 3-nitro. So ethoxy in position 1 (which is adjacent to tert-butyl in 2 and nitro in 3). To get that arrangement, the substituent directions must be controlled precisely. The first substitution is likely the tert-butyl group. After that, the nitro group is added either in position 3 or 1. Then, perhaps the ethoxy is added last. Wait, but ethoxy is introduced via nucleophilic substitution, which requires a good leaving group. The sulfonic acid group is a good leaving group under acidic conditions. So maybe the synthesis involves sulfonating the ring, then substituting the sulfonic acid with ethoxide. To get the ethoxy group in position 1, the sulfonic acid must be in position 1 prior. To put the sulfonic acid in position 1, the directing groups must lead to that. Let's consider that after adding tert-butyl (activating, ortho/para-directing) and nitro (deactivating, meta-directing) groups, sulfonation would occur in a certain position. Alternatively, the steps might be: 1. Friedel-Crafts to add tert-butyl in position 2. 2. Nitration directed by tert-butyl to position 3 (meta to tert-butyl). 3. Sulfonation directed by nitro group to position 1 (meta to nitro). 4. Replace sulfonic acid in position 1 with ethoxy. However, sulfonation is a reversible process. Under electrophilic substitution, the sulfonic acid would add para or meta to existing groups. If the ring has tert-butyl in 2 and nitro in 3, then sulfonic acid could add in position 1 (para to tert-butyl?), but tert-butyl is in 2, so para would be 6. Alternatively, meta to nitro (position 5 or 1). Hmm. Alternatively, the steps might be: Introduce tert-butyl (position 2). Introduce nitro in position 3 (directed by tert-butyl). Introduce another nitro in position 1. Then remove one nitro to install ethoxy. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, the correct sequence is option B. Let's look at option B's steps: B) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; viii) dilute H2SO4 ; ix) NaOH/EtBr. Wait, that's nine steps, but the options list only nine steps. Let's walk through this. Step i) Friedel-Crafts with tert-butyl chloride: adds tert-butyl group to benzene, para position. So para-tert-butylbenzene. Step ii) sulfonation with SO3/H2SO4: adds sulfonic acid group. Since tert-butyl is activating, para directing, the sulfonic acid (which is a deactivating, meta-directing group) would add in the meta position relative to tert-butyl. If tert-butyl is in position 2, sulfonic acid would add in position 5 (meta). But that might not help. Alternatively, sulfonation occurs para to the tert-butyl. If tert-butyl is in 2, sulfonic acid would be in position 6. Then, nitration step iii) would add nitro group. Nitro groups are directed by the sulfonic acid. Since sulfonic acid is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group, the nitro would add meta to sulfonic acid. If sulfonic acid is in 6, the nitro would go to 3. Then, after steps iv) Fe/HCl (reduce nitro to amino?), step v) diazotization, step vi) nitration again, etc. This is getting too tangled. Alternatively, think about the final product and work backward. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. The ethoxy group is at position 1, nitro at 3, and tert-butyl at 2. So these three substituents are in adjacent positions. To achieve this, the synthesis likely: 1. Starts with benzene. 2. Adds tert-butyl group at position 2. 3. Adds nitro group at position 3. 4. Adds ethoxy group at position 1. But how to add ethoxy group selectively at position 1. Since position 1 is adjacent to both tert-butyl (2) and nitro (3). Ethoxy is typically installed by nucleophilic attack. If there's a leaving group in position 1, like a sulfonic acid, then under high temp and acid, substituting with ethoxide. So: Suppose steps are: a. Friedel-Crafts to add tert-butyl in position 2. b. Nitration directed by tert-butyl to position 3. c. Sulfonation directed by nitro group to position 1. d. Replace sulfonic acid in position 1 with ethoxy. e. Any necessary nitration touch-ups. But let's see the options. Option D's steps: i) Friedel-Crafts with tert-butyl. ii) Nitration. iii) Fe/HCl (hydrogenation). iv) Nitration again. v) Diazotization. vi) Hydrolysis. vii) Ethylation. viii) Sulfonation. ix) Dilute H2SO4 (neutralization?). This order seems off. Alternatively, option C: i) Friedel-Crafts. ii) HNO3, iii) SO3, iv) diazotization, v) dilute H2SO4, vi) H3O+/H2O heat, vii) NaOH/EtBr, viii) Fe/HCl, ix) HNO3. This order also seems problematic. Option B: i) Friedel-Crafts. ii) SO3. iii) HNO3. iv) Fe/HCl. v) diazotization. vi) HNO3. vii) H3O+/H2O heat. viii) dilute H2SO4. ix) NaOH/EtBr. This sequence starts with Friedel-Crafts (tert-butyl), then sulfonation, then nitration. Let's see: After Friedel-Crafts, we have para-tert-butylbenzene. Sulfonation would add sulfonic acid in meta or para. If added para to tert-butyl (position 6), then nitration would be directed by sulfonic acid. Since sulfonic acid is deactivating, meta-directing, the nitro would go meta to sulfonic acid (position 3). Then reduction with Fe/HCl gives amino in position 3. Diazotization of that. Then nitration again? That would require oxidation back to nitro, but if we reduce to amino and then nitrate again, that's possible. Then steps vi) through ix) maybe handle the ethoxy introduction. But this is getting too confusing. Alternatively, the correct answer might be D, but I need to verify. Let me look at the options again. The answer choices are A, B, C, D. Each represents a different sequence of reactions. The correct sequence should lead to the product with substituents in positions 1, 2, and 3. Let's outline the necessary steps: 1. Introduce tert-butyl group at position 2. 2. Introduce nitro group at position 3. 3. Introduce ethoxy group at position 1. The problem is how to control the regiochemistry for each step. First, adding tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts is straightforward. However, since Friedel-Crafts adds in para position, but position 2 is desired. Wait, unless they use some directing group. Wait, benzene doesn't have a directing group initially. So the first Friedel-Crafts would add tert-butyl in any position, but subsequent steps would build upon that. Let's say the first substitution is tert-butyl in position 2. Then, nitro is added in position 3 (ortho/activating director). Wait, but tert-butyl is a strong activating group, directing nitration to ortho or para. If the tert-butyl is in position 2, then positions 1, 3 (ortho), and 4 (para). Since nitro is a meta director if the existing group is deactivating, but tert-butyl is activating. Therefore, nitro would go para or ortho to tert-butyl. If the nitro is placed in position 3 (ortho to tert-butyl), how does that happen? Because the directing is para/ortho, but which one? The position depends on the specific reaction conditions and the bulk of the substituents. Alternatively, perhaps the synthesis uses a different approach: adding the nitro group first, then the tert-butyl, then the ethoxy. But the product has tert-butyl and ethoxy adjacent, which would complicate direction. Alternatively, let's refer to the options. In option D, the steps are: i) tert-butyl, ii) nitro, iii) Fe/HCl (reduce nitro to amino), iv) nitro again, v) diazo, vi) maybe hydrolysis, vii) ethylation, viii) sulfonation, ix) neutralization. This order seems problematic because sulfonation is late. In option B, steps include sulfonation early, then nitrations, then towards the end ethoxy introduction. The key is that the ethoxy group is introduced via substitution of a sulfonic acid group, which requires that the sulfonic acid is in position 1. To get the sulfonic acid in position 1, the earlier substituents must direct the sulfonation there. Let's assume the first steps in option B: i) Friedel-Crafts with tert-butyl (position 2). ii) Sulfonation (SO3). Since the ring now has a tert-butyl group (activating), the sulfonic acid will add para or ortho. If added in position 6 (para to tert-butyl), then subsequent nitration (step iii) would be directed by the sulfonic acid (deactivating, meta director). The nitro would add meta to sulfonic acid (position 3). Then, after reduction (step iv) to amino in position 3, diazotization (step v), nitration again (step vi), perhaps adding another nitro group. Then hydrolysis (step vii), NaOH/EtBr (step ix) for ethoxy introduction. This is getting too tangled. Alternatively, the correct sequence is option D. Let's check the steps: D) i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4. Wait, this sequence seems to introduce the groups in a way that allows for sulfonation after ethoxy introduction, which may not make sense. Alternatively, let's trace each option's steps to see which one logically leads to the product. Key steps needed: 1. Introduce tert-butyl group (Friedel-Crafts). 2. Introduce nitro groups in correct positions. 3. Use sulfonation and substitution to introduce ethoxy group. 4. Ensure all groups end up in the correct positions (1-ethoxy, 2-tert-butyl, 3-nitro). Looking at the options, the correct sequence likely involves: - Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride early on. - Nitration steps to place nitro groups. - Sulfonation followed by ethylation (Wurtz-Regitz or similar) to place ethoxy group. - Possible reduction and re-nitration steps to manage directing effects. Option B's steps: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; viii) dilute H2SO4 ; ix) NaOH/EtBr. Let's analyze: Step i: Friedel-Crafts with tert-butyl chloride. Adds tert-butyl group to benzene, para position (position 2). Step ii: sulfonation. Since tert-butyl is activating, the sulfonic acid adds in the meta position relative to tert-butyl (position 5 or 1). Let's say position 1 (meta to tert-butyl in position 2). Step iii: nitration. The sulfonic acid is deactivating, meta-directing, so nitration would add nitro meta to sulfonic

okay, let's see. i need to figure out which sequence of reactions would lead to the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. the target compound has three substituents on the benzene ring: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. the positions are important too—tert-butyl at position 2, ethoxy at position 1 (which is adjacent to position 2), and nitro at position 3. so, the substituents are in a specific order around the ring.
first, i need to recall the basic aromatic substitution reactions and how directing groups work. let's think about the substituents one by one.
let's think in parallel.

</goal>
<path>
1: the tert-butyl group is introduced via friedel-crafts alkylation using tert-butyl chloride as the alkylating agent and alcl3 as the catalyst. this substitution occurs at the para position relative to any existing substituents. if benzene is the starting material, the first substitution would be at the para position.
</path>
<path>
2: nitration typically requires a strong nitrating agent, such as a mixture of concentrated nitric acid (hno3) and concentrated sulfuric acid (h2so4).
</path>
<path>
3: the tert-butyl group, being a strong activating and para/ortho-directing group, directs incoming substituents to the para and ortho positions relative to itself.
</path>
<path>
4: the presence of a nitro group, a strong deactivating and meta-directing substituent, would then direct the incoming ethoxy group to the meta position relative to the nitro group.
</path>
<path>
5: the ethoxy group is introduced through nucleophilic aromatic substitution. this involves the use of ethyl bromide (etbr) in a basic condition, such as with sodium ethoxide (naoet), or more likely, in the presence of naoh. the mechanism for this is typically a substitution where the nitro group directs the incoming ethoxide ion to the para position relative to itself. however, the existing tert-butyl group at the ortho position might influence the regioselectivity. the nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. if the nitro group is at position 3, the ethoxy group should ideally form at position 4 (relative to nitro), but the tert-butyl at position 2 might block that position, leading to a different outcome. alternatively, the ethoxy group might enter at the ortho position relative to the nitro group, but steric hindrance from the tert-butyl group could prevent this. the exact regiochemistry here is a bit tricky. perhaps the nitro group is directing substitution para to itself, but the tert-butyl group is in the way, so the ethoxy group goes to the next available position. alternatively, the ethoxy group is introduced after hydrolysis of a sulfonic acid ester. wait, one of the steps involves so3/h2so4, which is sulfonation. sulfonic acid is a good leaving group under certain conditions. maybe the sequence involves sulfonating the ring first, then substituting the sulfonic acid group with ethoxy under high temperature and acid conditions (wurtz-emmons reaction?), but that's used for rearrangements. alternatively, maybe the sulfonic acid is replaced by ethoxide in a nucleophilic substitution. let me think. sulfonation is a reversible process. so, if you have a benzene ring with substituents, sulfonation occurs preferentially in a certain position. then, if you treat it with dilute h2so4 and heat, perhaps in the presence of acid, you can replace the sulfonic acid group with something else. but how does that relate to introducing ethoxy?
</path>
<conclusion>
the initial steps involve friedel-crafts alkylation to introduce the tert-butyl group, followed by nitration. the tert-butyl group directs incoming substituents to para/ortho positions, while the nitro group, once added, is a meta-directing group. the ethoxy group is introduced via nucleophilic substitution, potentially involving sulfonation and subsequent replacement of the sulfonic acid group.

now, the target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. let's map out the positions. let's number the benzene ring such that position 1 is the ethoxy group, position 2 is the tert-butyl group, and position 3 is the nitro group. so, substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. the benzene ring has six positions. so, the tert-butyl is adjacent to the ethoxy (positions 1 and 2) and the nitro is at position 3. so, the substituents are in a row: ethoxy, tert-butyl, nitro.
to achieve this, the synthesis would need to proceed in a way that each substituent is added in a position directed by the previous ones.
let's think in parallel.

5: hydrolysis of the sulfonic acid group using h3o+ and h2o under heating conditions yields the benzene ring with an amino group and a hydroxyl group at positions para to each other.
</path>
<path>
6: the sulfonic acid group is then replaced by ethoxy in step vii. this replacement involves treating the sulfonic acid with naoh and etbr under high temperature and acidic conditions (h3o+). the sulfonic acid is a good leaving group and can depart, forming a carbocation. the ethoxide ion (from naoh and etbr) then attacks the carbocation to introduce the ethoxy group. the exact position of this substitution is determined by the existing substituents. the amino group at position 2 is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. the sulfonic acid group was at position 6 (assuming numbering where tert-butyl is 2, nitro is 3, sulfonic acid is 6). when the sulfonic acid is replaced by ethoxy, the ethoxy group would ideally go para to the amino group (position 4) or adjacent. however, positions 4 and 5 are already taken by the nitro and part of the ring. wait, maybe my numbering is off. let's re-examine. if we have tert-butyl at position 2, nitro at position 3, and amino at position 2 (after reduction), then the sulfonic acid would be at position 6. when substituting the sulfonic acid with ethoxide, the ethoxide would attack the carbocation formed at position 6. but the amino group at position 2 is activating, directing para/ortho. the ethoxide would want to add para to the amino (position 4) or ortho to the amino (positions 1 or 3). however, position 4 is occupied by the nitro group, and position 3 is the nitro. position 1 is adjacent to tert-butyl. wait, maybe the numbering is different. let me try to draw this.
if we start with benzene, add tert-butyl at position 2, then nitro at position 3. then, after reduction to amino, sulfonation occurs. where does sulfonic acid add? the amino group (position 2) is strong activating, so sulfonic acid (electrophilic substitution) would add in the meta position relative to amino. that would be position 5. then, replacing sulfonic acid at position 5 with ethoxy. but then ethoxy would be at position 5. but in the target molecule, ethoxy is at position 1. hmm, this seems inconsistent. alternatively, perhaps after adding tert-butyl and two nitro groups, the sulfonic acid is added in a certain position, then replaced by ethoxy. this is getting confusing. let's check another approach. maybe the correct sequence is option d.
</path>
<path>
7: the hydrogenation step converts the nitro group into an amino group.
</path>
<path>
8: the final nitration step in the sequence converts the amino group into a nitro group, yielding the target molecule, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.
</path>
<conclusion>
the proposed sequence in option d involves friedel-crafts alkylation to introduce tert-butyl, followed by nitration, hydrogenation, a second nitration, a sandmeyer-type reaction, sulfonation, hydrolysis, ethylation, and a final nitration. this sequence yields a product that matches the target structure of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, as the ethoxy group is correctly positioned at the site previously occupied by the sulfonic acid, and the final nitration regenerates the nitro group at the position initially introduced by the second nitration step.

alternatively, option a: nitration, hydrogenation, friedel-crafts, nitration, diazotization, sulfonation, hydrolysis, acid hydrolysis, ethylation. this seems to have more steps and a different order.
option b starts with friedel-crafts, then sulfonation, nitration, fe/hcl (catalytic hydrogenation?), diazotization, nitration, acid hydrolysis, ethylation. the steps here might lead to the correct product. let me walk through option b step by step.

</path>
<conclusion>
option b's proposed sequence of reactions begins with friedel-crafts alkylation to introduce the tert-butyl group, followed by sulfonation, nitration, catalytic hydrogenation, diazotization, a second nitration, and acid hydrolysis. the sequence concludes with the introduction of the ethoxy group, a process similar to that in option d.

if the sulfonic acid is at position 6, replacing it with ethoxy would place the ethoxy at position 6. but in the target molecule, ethoxy is at position 1. this might not align. alternatively, the numbering in the product after the first steps could be different. let's try to track positions step by step for option d. option d steps: i) tert-butyl chloride/alcl3 → friedel-crafts para tert-butylbenzene. ii) hno3/h2so4 → nitration. since tert-butyl is para, the nitro group would enter either meta to tert-butyl. wait, but tert-butyl is activating, para/ortho-directing. wait, nitration is a meta directing due to the deactivating effect, but wait, the substituent on the ring affects the directing. wait, the tert-butyl group is a strong activating group (since it's a烷yl group), and it is para/ortho-directing. so when nitrating para-tert-butylbenzene, the nitro group should go meta to the tert-butyl group, because in meta position. wait, no. let me check: for monosubstituted benzene, the direction of incoming groups depends on the substituent's activating/deactivating and meta/para-ortho directing. since tert-butyl is activating and para/ortho-directing, the nitro group (which is a meta director if the existing substituent is activating?) wait, no. let me recall: the nitration reaction is meta directed by deactivating, meta-directing groups and ortho/para by activating groups. wait, no. let me clarify: for nitration, the directing is as follows: - if the existing substituent is a deactivating meta-director (like nitro, sulfonic acid, etc.), then the nitro group will add meta to it. - if the existing substituent is activating (like methyl, tert-butyl, etc.), the nitro group will add para or ortho. since the first substitution is tert-butyl (activating), the second substitution (nitration) will occur in para or ortho relative to tert-butyl. since the tert-butyl is already in para position (relative to where else? if we started with benzene, after friedel-crafts, the tert-butyl is in one position. then nitration would add in para or ortho. wait, maybe the first substitution is in position 1 (tert-butyl), then the nitration could be in position 2 or position 4. but depending on the substitution. alternatively, if we start with benzene, substitute tert-butyl in position 2, then nitrate in position 3. wait, but how does that work? let's clarify. suppose we start with benzene. step i) friedel-crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride. since benzene is symmetric, the first substitution can be in any position. but subsequent steps depend on the direction. wait, maybe the numbering in the target compound is such that the tert-butyl is in position 2, ethoxy in 1, and nitro in 3. so the ring has substituents in positions 1, 2, and 3. but benzene has six positions. so maybe the steps are: 1) introduce tert-butyl at position 2. 2) introduce nitro at position 3. 3) perform some substitutions to get ethoxy at position 1. but how? let's think again. alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence first installs the tert-butyl group, then adds a nitro group in the correct position, then reduces the nitro to amino, does sulfonation, replaces the sulfonic acid with ethoxy, and then re-nitrates. but in which order? let's look at option d's steps: i) tert-butyl chloride/alcl3 → friedel-crafts, giving para-tert-butylbenzene. ii) hno3/h2so4 → nitration. so now we have nitro in meta position relative to tert-butyl? no, since tert-butyl is activating, directing groups would add para or ortho. wait, if we have tert-butyl in position 2, the next substitution (nitration) would be in position 3 (meta to tert-butyl)? but tert-butyl is a para/ortho director. wait, this is confusing. alternatively, perhaps the nitration occurs in position 1, making a para nitro to the tert-butyl. wait, let's imagine the benzene ring with tert-butyl in position 2. then, positions 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 are available. since tert-butyl is para/ortho director, the nitro would add in position 1 (ortho) or position 4 (para). but position 4 is two positions across. but if we add nitro in position 1 (ortho to tert-butyl), then the next steps need to add ethoxy in position 3. alternatively, adding nitro in position 4 (para to tert-butyl), but then how would ethoxy get into position 1? let me sketch this mentally. suppose after step ii in option d, nitro is added in position 1 (ortho to tert-butyl in position 2). then, after step iii) fe/hcl, which is catalytic hydrogenation, reducing nitro to amino. so now we have amino in position 1 and tert-butyl in position 2. step iv) hno3/h2so4: another nitration. now, the amino group is activating, ortho/para-directing. so the nitro group would add para to amino (position 4) or ortho. but tert-butyl is in position 2, which is adjacent to position 1 (amino). adding another nitro para to amino (position 4) would be possible. then, step v) nano2/hcl: diazotization. this would convert maybe one of the amines? wait, but we only have one amino group here. wait, after the first reduction, we have an aniline (assuming nitro was reduced to amino). then, if we nitrate again, adding another nitro group, perhaps in position 4. then, step v) diazotization (assuming we have a primary amine). if the amino group is in position 1, then treatment with nitrous acid (nano2/hcl) would convert it into a diazonium salt. but if there are nitro groups adjacent, we need to ensure that the amino group can form a stable diazonium salt. diazonium salts are formed from primary amines in acidic conditions. but nitro groups are strongly deactivating. if the amino is next to a nitro (as in position 1, with nitro in position 2 or 4), it might be more difficult to form the diazonium salt. however, if the amino is para to another nitro, that might be okay. wait, maybe the sequence is different. let me recap option d's steps: i) friedel-crafts with tert-butyl: benzene becomes para-tert-butylbenzene. ii) nitration: adds nitro group. since the tert-butyl is activating, the nitro would add in para or ortho. let's say it adds in para. wait, but para to tert-butyl would be the opposite position. but benzene has six positions. if the tert-butyl is in position 2, para would be position 6. then nitro in position 6. then reduction with fe/hcl would give amino in position 6. then next nitration would add nitro in position 5 (meta to amino)? not sure. this is getting complicated. let's consider the target structure: substituents at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). so adjacent substituents: ethoxy in 1, tert-butyl in 2, nitro in 3. that's a consecutive sequence around the ring. to achieve this, the directing during each substitution step is critical. the first substitution is tert-butyl at position 2. how do we get that? if we start with benzene and do friedel-crafts alkylation, the first substitution can be anywhere, but subsequent steps would depend on that. wait, but friedel-crafts is for activating groups, and the product is a mix, but perhaps the reaction is para-selective. alternatively, maybe the synthesis uses a directed synthesis for the first substitution, but without specific directing groups, the first substitution is random. however, in a synthesis problem, we can assume that the first substitution occurs in a position that allows the following steps to place the other groups correctly. alternatively, maybe the synthesis uses a different approach. let's consider the steps in option d: d) i) tert-butyl chloride/alcl3 ; ii) hno3/h2so4 ; iii) fe/hcl ; iv) hno3/h2so4 ; v) nano2/hcl ; vi) h3o+, h2o/heat ; vii) naoh/etbr ; vii) so3/h2so4 ; ix) dilute h2so4 but wait, option d's steps: i) friedel-crafts with tert-butyl chloride → para tert-butylbenzene. ii) nitration: adds nitro group. assuming the nitro adds in para or ortho to tert-butyl. let's say it adds in position 3 (ortho to tert-butyl in position 2). then, after reduction with fe/hcl (iii), we have an amino group in position 3. iv) another nitration. now, the amino group is activating, so the nitro would add para or ortho to amino. if amino is in position 3, adding nitro para would be position 6, ortho would be position 2 or 4. but position 2 is already occupied by tert-butyl, so para (position 6) is possible. then, step v) diazotization (nano2/hcl) of the amino group in position 3. this would convert it into a diazonium group. then, maybe vi) hydrolysis (h3o+/h2o/heat) to remove the diazonium group (maybe to hydroxyl?). wait, but under what conditions? alternatively, if the diazonium salt is treated with water under acidic and heating conditions, it could undergo hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid. but that's not helpful. wait, perhaps step vi) is supposed to remove the diazonium group. alternatively, maybe steps vi) and vii) are related to introducing the ethoxy group. alternatively, maybe after diazotization, the group is replaced. for example, step vi) might be a substitution of the diazonium group. diazonium salts can undergo replacement reactions. for example, treatment with h3o+/heat could cause hydrolysis to a phenolic group, but if the diazonium is on a benzene ring with other electron-withdrawing groups, it might hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid. but we need to form ethoxy group. wait, step vii) is naoh/etbr, which sounds like an sn2 reaction, maybe ethylation. but if the diazonium group is replaced by ethyl bromide under alkaline conditions? that could be a replacement. for example, gattermann-koch reaction replaces diazonium with hydrogen, but under different conditions, maybe other groups. alternatively, the diazonium salt can be coupled with something that provides an ethoxy group. but i'm getting confused. alternatively, maybe after the second nitration, the amino group is still present, and then steps vi) through vii) introduce the ethoxy group. but the sequence in option d is getting too long, and i'm losing track. maybe i should look at the options' structures again. the key is that the target molecule has three substituents: 2-(tert-butyl), 1-ethoxy, 3-nitro. so ethoxy in position 1 (which is adjacent to tert-butyl in 2 and nitro in 3). to get that arrangement, the substituent directions must be controlled precisely. the first substitution is likely the tert-butyl group. after that, the nitro group is added either in position 3 or 1. then, perhaps the ethoxy is added last. wait, but ethoxy is introduced via nucleophilic substitution, which requires a good leaving group. the sulfonic acid group is a good leaving group under acidic conditions. so maybe the synthesis involves sulfonating the ring, then substituting the sulfonic acid with ethoxide. to get the ethoxy group in position 1, the sulfonic acid must be in position 1 prior. to put the sulfonic acid in position 1, the directing groups must lead to that. let's consider that after adding tert-butyl (activating, ortho/para-directing) and nitro (deactivating, meta-directing) groups, sulfonation would occur in a certain position. alternatively, the steps might be: 1. friedel-crafts to add tert-butyl in position 2. 2. nitration directed by tert-butyl to position 3 (meta to tert-butyl). 3. sulfonation directed by nitro group to position 1 (meta to nitro). 4. replace sulfonic acid in position 1 with ethoxy. however, sulfonation is a reversible process. under electrophilic substitution, the sulfonic acid would add para or meta to existing groups. if the ring has tert-butyl in 2 and nitro in 3, then sulfonic acid could add in position 1 (para to tert-butyl?), but tert-butyl is in 2, so para would be 6. alternatively, meta to nitro (position 5 or 1). hmm. alternatively, the steps might be: introduce tert-butyl (position 2). introduce nitro in position 3 (directed by tert-butyl). introduce another nitro in position 1. then remove one nitro to install ethoxy. but that might not be efficient. alternatively, the correct sequence is option b. let's look at option b's steps: b) i) tert-butyl chloride/alcl3 ; ii) so3/h2so4 ; iii) hno3/h2so4 ; iv) fe/hcl ; v) nano2/hcl ; vi) hno3/h2so4 ; vii) h3o+, h2o/heat ; viii) dilute h2so4 ; ix) naoh/etbr. wait, that's nine steps, but the options list only nine steps. let's walk through this. step i) friedel-crafts with tert-butyl chloride: adds tert-butyl group to benzene, para position. so para-tert-butylbenzene. step ii) sulfonation with so3/h2so4: adds sulfonic acid group. since tert-butyl is activating, para directing, the sulfonic acid (which is a deactivating, meta-directing group) would add in the meta position relative to tert-butyl. if tert-butyl is in position 2, sulfonic acid would add in position 5 (meta). but that might not help. alternatively, sulfonation occurs para to the tert-butyl. if tert-butyl is in 2, sulfonic acid would be in position 6. then, nitration step iii) would add nitro group. nitro groups are directed by the sulfonic acid. since sulfonic acid is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group, the nitro would add meta to sulfonic acid. if sulfonic acid is in 6, the nitro would go to 3. then, after steps iv) fe/hcl (reduce nitro to amino?), step v) diazotization, step vi) nitration again, etc. this is getting too tangled. alternatively, think about the final product and work backward. the target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. the ethoxy group is at position 1, nitro at 3, and tert-butyl at 2. so these three substituents are in adjacent positions. to achieve this, the synthesis likely: 1. starts with benzene. 2. adds tert-butyl group at position 2. 3. adds nitro group at position 3. 4. adds ethoxy group at position 1. but how to add ethoxy group selectively at position 1. since position 1 is adjacent to both tert-butyl (2) and nitro (3). ethoxy is typically installed by nucleophilic attack. if there's a leaving group in position 1, like a sulfonic acid, then under high temp and acid, substituting with ethoxide. so: suppose steps are: a. friedel-crafts to add tert-butyl in position 2. b. nitration directed by tert-butyl to position 3. c. sulfonation directed by nitro group to position 1. d. replace sulfonic acid in position 1 with ethoxy. e. any necessary nitration touch-ups. but let's see the options. option d's steps: i) friedel-crafts with tert-butyl. ii) nitration. iii) fe/hcl (hydrogenation). iv) nitration again. v) diazotization. vi) hydrolysis. vii) ethylation. viii) sulfonation. ix) dilute h2so4 (neutralization?). this order seems off. alternatively, option c: i) friedel-crafts. ii) hno3, iii) so3, iv) diazotization, v) dilute h2so4, vi) h3o+/h2o heat, vii) naoh/etbr, viii) fe/hcl, ix) hno3. this order also seems problematic. option b: i) friedel-crafts. ii) so3. iii) hno3. iv) fe/hcl. v) diazotization. vi) hno3. vii) h3o+/h2o heat. viii) dilute h2so4. ix) naoh/etbr. this sequence starts with friedel-crafts (tert-butyl), then sulfonation, then nitration. let's see: after friedel-crafts, we have para-tert-butylbenzene. sulfonation would add sulfonic acid in meta or para. if added para to tert-butyl (position 6), then nitration would be directed by sulfonic acid. since sulfonic acid is deactivating, meta-directing, the nitro would go meta to sulfonic acid (position 3). then reduction with fe/hcl gives amino in position 3. diazotization of that. then nitration again? that would require oxidation back to nitro, but if we reduce to amino and then nitrate again, that's possible. then steps vi) through ix) maybe handle the ethoxy introduction. but this is getting too confusing. alternatively, the correct answer might be d, but i need to verify. let me look at the options again. the answer choices are a, b, c, d. each represents a different sequence of reactions. the correct sequence should lead to the product with substituents in positions 1, 2, and 3. let's outline the necessary steps: 1. introduce tert-butyl group at position 2. 2. introduce nitro group at position 3. 3. introduce ethoxy group at position 1. the problem is how to control the regiochemistry for each step. first, adding tert-butyl via friedel-crafts is straightforward. however, since friedel-crafts adds in para position, but position 2 is desired. wait, unless they use some directing group. wait, benzene doesn't have a directing group initially. so the first friedel-crafts would add tert-butyl in any position, but subsequent steps would build upon that. let's say the first substitution is tert-butyl in position 2. then, nitro is added in position 3 (ortho/activating director). wait, but tert-butyl is a strong activating group, directing nitration to ortho or para. if the tert-butyl is in position 2, then positions 1, 3 (ortho), and 4 (para). since nitro is a meta director if the existing group is deactivating, but tert-butyl is activating. therefore, nitro would go para or ortho to tert-butyl. if the nitro is placed in position 3 (ortho to tert-butyl), how does that happen? because the directing is para/ortho, but which one? the position depends on the specific reaction conditions and the bulk of the substituents. alternatively, perhaps the synthesis uses a different approach: adding the nitro group first, then the tert-butyl, then the ethoxy. but the product has tert-butyl and ethoxy adjacent, which would complicate direction. alternatively, let's refer to the options. in option d, the steps are: i) tert-butyl, ii) nitro, iii) fe/hcl (reduce nitro to amino), iv) nitro again, v) diazo, vi) maybe hydrolysis, vii) ethylation, viii) sulfonation, ix) neutralization. this order seems problematic because sulfonation is late. in option b, steps include sulfonation early, then nitrations, then towards the end ethoxy introduction. the key is that the ethoxy group is introduced via substitution of a sulfonic acid group, which requires that the sulfonic acid is in position 1. to get the sulfonic acid in position 1, the earlier substituents must direct the sulfonation there. let's assume the first steps in option b: i) friedel-crafts with tert-butyl (position 2). ii) sulfonation (so3). since the ring now has a tert-butyl group (activating), the sulfonic acid will add para or ortho. if added in position 6 (para to tert-butyl), then subsequent nitration (step iii) would be directed by the sulfonic acid (deactivating, meta director). the nitro would add meta to sulfonic acid (position 3). then, after reduction (step iv) to amino in position 3, diazotization (step v), nitration again (step vi), perhaps adding another nitro group. then hydrolysis (step vii), naoh/etbr (step ix) for ethoxy introduction. this is getting too tangled. alternatively, the correct sequence is option d. let's check the steps: d) i) tert-butyl chloride/alcl3 ; ii) hno3/h2so4 ; iii) fe/hcl ; iv) hno3/h2so4 ; v) nano2/hcl ; vi) h3o+, h2o/heat ; vii) naoh/etbr ; viii) so3/h2so4 ; ix) dilute h2so4. wait, this sequence seems to introduce the groups in a way that allows for sulfonation after ethoxy introduction, which may not make sense. alternatively, let's trace each option's steps to see which one logically leads to the product. key steps needed: 1. introduce tert-butyl group (friedel-crafts). 2. introduce nitro groups in correct positions. 3. use sulfonation and substitution to introduce ethoxy group. 4. ensure all groups end up in the correct positions (1-ethoxy, 2-tert-butyl, 3-nitro). looking at the options, the correct sequence likely involves: - friedel-crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride early on. - nitration steps to place nitro groups. - sulfonation followed by ethylation (wurtz-regitz or similar) to place ethoxy group. - possible reduction and re-nitration steps to manage directing effects. option b's steps: i) tert-butyl chloride/alcl3 ; ii) so3/h2so4 ; iii) hno3/h2so4 ; iv) fe/hcl ; v) nano2/hcl ; vi) hno3/h2so4 ; vii) h3o+, h2o/heat ; viii) dilute h2so4 ; ix) naoh/etbr. let's analyze: step i: friedel-crafts with tert-butyl chloride. adds tert-butyl group to benzene, para position (position 2). step ii: sulfonation. since tert-butyl is activating, the sulfonic acid adds in the meta position relative to tert-butyl (position 5 or 1). let's say position 1 (meta to tert-butyl in position 2). step iii: nitration. the sulfonic acid is deactivating, meta-directing, so nitration would add nitro meta to sulfonic
