Okay, let's tackle this astronomy math problem step by step. The question is about how the number of stars in a region of the sky changes with distance, given that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. The options are A) r^2, B) r^4, C) r^5, D) r^3. Hmm, first, I need to recall what parallax is and how it relates to distance. Parallax is a method used to measure the distance to stars. The basic idea is that as the Earth orbits the Sun, the position of a star appears to shift relative to more distant background stars. The parallax angle is half the angle subtended by the Earth's orbit at the star. The parallax (plx) is usually measured in arcseconds. The distance to a star is inversely proportional to its parallax. Specifically, distance (in parsecs) is equal to 1 / parallax (in arcseconds). So, if plx is the parallax in arcseconds, then the distance r in parsecs is r = 1 / plx. The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 / plx^5. So, N(plx) = k / plx^5, where k is some constant. But we need to find how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So, the question is asking about the distribution of stars as a function of distance, N(r), given that N(plx) is proportional to 1 / plx^5. Since we need to relate N(r) to N(plx), we have to consider how the variables plx and r are related and how the density changes with respect to r instead of plx. First, since r = 1 / plx, we can express plx in terms of r: plx = 1 / r. But we also need to consider that when changing variables from plx to r, the differential (the range of distances or parallaxes) also transforms. If the number of stars per unit parallax is N(plx) = k / plx^5, then when converting to number of stars per unit distance, we have to account for the fact that a small change in plx corresponds to a small change in r. Specifically, if dN is the number of stars in a small range d(plx), then we need to find the number of stars in a corresponding small range dr. Since r = 1 / plx, we can compute dr in terms of d(plx). Let's take the derivative: dr = d(1 / plx) = - (1 / plx^2) d(plx). But since we're talking about ranges (absolute quantities), the sign doesn't matter, so |dr| = (1 / plx^2) d(plx). Or, equivalently, d(plx) = (plx^2) |dr|. So, the number of stars per unit parallax is N(plx) = k / plx^5. The total number of stars in a small parallax interval d(plx) is N(plx) * d(plx) = k / plx^5 * d(plx). But we want this expressed in terms of dr. Substituting d(plx) = plx^2 dr, we get: Number of stars in dr = k / plx^5 * plx^2 dr = k / plx^3 dr. Since plx = 1 / r, substitute that in: Number of stars in dr = k / (1/r)^3 dr = k * r^3 dr. Therefore, the number of stars per unit distance (i.e., N(r)) is k * r^3. So N(r) is proportional to r^3. Therefore, the answer should be D) ~ r^3. Wait, let me verify that again. The key steps are: 1. N(plx) = k / plx^5. 2. Convert d(plx) to dr using the relation plx = 1/r. So, plx = 1/r ==> d(plx) = - (1/r^2) dr. The absolute value would be d(plx) = (1/r^2) dr. 3. So, substituting into N(plx) * d(plx) = k / plx^5 * d(plx) = k * (1 / plx^5) * (1/r^2) dr. But since plx = 1/r, 1 / plx^5 = r^5, and 1/r^2 is already there. So, total: k * r^5 * 1/r^2 dr = k * r^3 dr. Therefore, the number per unit distance is proportional to r^3. Therefore, the answer is D) ~ r^3. That makes sense. In astronomy, when considering the number of stars as a function of distance, if the number per unit parallax is proportional to 1 / plx^n, then due to the transformation involving the Jacobian (which here is the derivative dr/dplx), the exponent changes. In this case, n=5, and the transformation gave us an extra plx^2 factor, so 5 - 2 = 3, which corresponds to r^3. So yes, the final answer is D.
