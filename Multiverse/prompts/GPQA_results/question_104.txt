Okay, let's see. The problem is about two exoplanets detected using the Radial Velocity (RV) method. Both planets are Neptune-like in mass, and their stars are similar to the Sun. The key information here is the periodic wavelength shift of the spectral lines for each star, which is 5 milliangstroms for planet 1 and 7 milliangstroms for planet 2. We need to find how many times longer the orbital period of planet 2 is compared to planet 1.
First, I need to recall how the RV method works. The radial velocity method detects the wobble of a star caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The velocity of the star is related to the reflex motion due to the planet's orbit. The Doppler effect causes a shift in the spectral lines, which is proportional to the star's velocity.
So, the wavelength shift (Δλ) is related to the star's velocity (v) through the formula: Δλ/λ = v/c
Where λ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line, v is the velocity of the star along the line of sight, and c is the speed of light.
Since both stars have the same mass and the planets have similar masses (Neptune-like), the velocity semi-amplitudes of the stars should be inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period. Wait, let me think. The velocity semi-amplitude (K) of the star is given by: K = (1/vπ) * (M_p sin i)^(1/3) * (P/(1 - e^2))^(1/3)
But wait, actually, the RV signal's amplitude depends on several factors. Let me recall the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude for the star in the RV method. The formula is: K = (v * sin i) / (1 + m_p/M_*)^(1/3)) But wait, maybe I'm confusing variables here. Let me check.
The radial velocity semi-amplitude of the star is given by: K_* = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) * P^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * (sin i) But this seems complicated. Alternatively, the relation between the planet's orbital parameters and the stellar velocity can be simplified when the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass (which is usually the case). Then, M_p << M_*, so we can approximate (1 + m_p/M_*)^(-1/3) ≈ 1 - (1/3)(m_p/M_*). But since the problem states that both planets have masses similar to Neptune and the stars have masses similar to the Sun, the approximation might hold because Neptune-mass planets are much less massive than the Sun.
Therefore, the velocity semi-amplitude K (which is the maximum velocity of the star) is approximately: K ≈ ( (G * M_p * sin i ) / ( (M_*)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) * P^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) )
Wait, maybe I need to recall that the relation between the star's velocity semi-amplitude (K) and the planet's properties is: K = ( (G * P ) / (2 * π) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i / (M_* + M_p) )^(1/3) )
But again, with M_p << M_*, this simplifies to: K ≈ ( (G * P ) / (2 * π) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i / M_* )^(1/3) ) )
But the problem states that both planets have masses similar to Neptune, and the stars have masses similar to the Sun. Since Neptune's mass is much less than the Sun's mass (Neptune's mass is about 17 Earth masses, Sun's is ~333,000 Earth masses), so the approximation M_p << M_* holds. Therefore, we can use: K ∝ (M_p / M_*)^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )
But both planets here have similar masses (similar to Neptune), and the stars have similar masses (similar to the Sun). Therefore, the term (M_p / M_*) is the same for both planets. Therefore, the velocity semi-amplitudes (K1 and K2) are inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital periods (P1 and P2).
That is, K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3). Therefore, K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)
So, solving for the period ratio: (P2 / P1) = (K1 / K2)^3
But in the problem, the observed quantity is the wavelength shift, which is proportional to the velocity. Therefore, Δλ is proportional to K.
Given that Δλ1 = 5 milliangstroms and Δλ2 = 7 milliangstroms. So, the ratio of K1 to K2 is 5/7.
Therefore, (P2 / P1) = (5/7)^3
Calculating that: First, 5^3 = 125, 7^3 = 343. Therefore, 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644
But the question asks: "How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?"
Wait, hold on. If (P2 / P1) = (K1 / K2)^3 = (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.3644, that would mean P2 is approximately 0.3644 times P1. But that would mean planet 2's period is shorter, but the options include ~1.96 and ~1.40. Wait, this seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps I mixed up the ratio.
Wait, the formula derived above is (P2 / P1) = (K1 / K2)^3. Since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so if K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3), which rearranges to (P2 / P1) = (K1 / K2)^3
But in the problem, the wavelength shifts are given. Since Δλ ∝ K, the ratio of the shifts is K1/K2 = 5/7. Therefore, substituting into the equation: (P2 / P1) = (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.3644. Therefore, P2 is approximately 0.3644 times P1, meaning planet 2's period is about 0.36 times that of planet 1. However, the question asks "How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then planet #2's period is shorter, but the question is asking how many times longer. If the answer is a fraction less than 1, that would mean shorter, but the options given are ~0.36, which is C, and D is ~0.8. The exact reciprocal would be 1 / 0.3644 ≈ 2.74, which isn't an option. Wait, but the calculation leads to P2 being about 0.36 times P1, so the ratio of P2 to P1 is 0.36. Therefore, the answer is C) ~0.36.
Wait, but let me confirm once again. The RV method: the velocity semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period. So if K is larger, the period is shorter. Planet 1 has a smaller wavelength shift (5 mA) compared to planet 2 (7 mA). Wait, wavelength shift is proportional to K, so a larger shift means the star is moving faster (larger K). So if planet 2's star has a larger shift (7 mA vs 5 mA), that means K2 is larger than K1. Therefore, using the relation (P2 / P1) = (K1 / K2)^3, if K1 < K2, then (K1/K2) is less than 1, so (K1/K2)^3 is even smaller, so P2 / P1 is less than 1, meaning P2 is shorter than P1. But the question asks "How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" If P2 is shorter, the ratio is less than 1, so for example, if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then planet #2's period is 0.36 times as long, or 36% as long. Therefore, the answer would be C.
But let me cross-check with another approach. Using Kepler's third law, which relates the orbital period to the semi-major axis. However, in the radial velocity method, the velocity semi-amplitude also depends on the inclination angle, but since we don't have information about that, we assume that the inclination angles are the same (but generally, inclination is unknown, but since both planets are in circular orbits and we don't have other info, maybe we can assume sin i is the same for both? Wait, but the problem doesn't specify whether the orbits are edge-on or the inclination angles are known. Hmm. However, in the RV method, the velocity semi-amplitude depends on sin i, but unless we have information about the inclination, we have to assume that the observed velocity amplitudes (K) are the same as the true velocities. But since the problem doesn't provide any information about inclination, we have to assume that sin i is the same for both, which is a common assumption when comparing two planets detected via RV if no additional information is given. So proceeding with that assumption.
So, given that K is proportional to (M_p / M_*)^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )
But since both M_p and M_* are the same for both planets, the term (M_p / M_*)^(1/3) is the same. Therefore, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So, K1 / K2 = P2^(1/3) / P1^(1/3). Therefore, (K1 / K2) = (P2 / P1)^(1/3). Therefore, (P2 / P1) = (K1 / K2)^3.
Now, the problem states that the wavelength shifts are 5 mA and 7 mA. Since the wavelength shift Δλ is proportional to the velocity v, and hence to K. Therefore, K1 / K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2 = 5 / 7.
Therefore, (P2 / P1) = (5/7)^3 = (125) / (343) ≈ 0.364.
Therefore, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it is shorter. So the answer is C) ~0.36.
But wait, the options are: A) ~ 1.96 B) ~ 1.40 C) ~ 0.36 D) ~ 0.8

Answer: To determine how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, we use the relationship between the radial velocity (RV) method and the orbital period. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Relationship between velocity semi-amplitude (K) and orbital period (P):**
   The velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period \( P \). This relationship is given by:
   \[
   K \propto \left( \frac{1}{P^{1/3}} \right)
   \]
   Therefore, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes \( \frac{K_1}{K_2} \) is proportional to the ratio of the cube roots of the periods \( \left( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \right)^{1/3} \right) \).

2. **Proportionality of wavelength shift to velocity:**
   The periodic wavelength shift (Δλ) is proportional to the velocity semi-amplitude \( K \). Given the shifts for planet #1 and planet #2 are 5 mA and 7 mA respectively, we have:
   \[
   \frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{\Delta\lambda_1}{\Delta\lambda_2} = \frac{5}{7}
   \]

3. **Solving for the period ratio:**
   Using the relationship derived from the RV method:
   \[
   \frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \right)^{1/3}
   \]
   Cubing both sides to solve for \( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \):
   \[
   \left( \frac{5}{7} \right)^3 = \frac{P_2}{P_1}
   \]
   Calculating the cube:
   \[
   \left( \frac{5}{7} \right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
   \]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1, indicating it is shorter. 

The final answer is \boxed{C}.

okay, let's see. the problem is about two exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (rv) method. both planets are neptune-like in mass, and their stars are similar to the sun. the key information here is the periodic wavelength shift of the spectral lines for each star, which is 5 milliangstroms for planet 1 and 7 milliangstroms for planet 2. we need to find how many times longer the orbital period of planet 2 is compared to planet 1.
first, i need to recall how the rv method works. the radial velocity method detects the wobble of a star caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. the velocity of the star is related to the reflex motion due to the planet's orbit. the doppler effect causes a shift in the spectral lines, which is proportional to the star's velocity.
so, the wavelength shift (δλ) is related to the star's velocity (v) through the formula: δλ/λ = v/c
where λ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line, v is the velocity of the star along the line of sight, and c is the speed of light.
since both stars have the same mass and the planets have similar masses (neptune-like), the velocity semi-amplitudes of the stars should be inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period. wait, let me think. the velocity semi-amplitude (k) of the star is given by: k = (1/vπ) * (m_p sin i)^(1/3) * (p/(1 - e^2))^(1/3)
but wait, actually, the rv signal's amplitude depends on several factors. let me recall the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude for the star in the rv method. the formula is: k = (v * sin i) / (1 + m_p/m_*)^(1/3)) but wait, maybe i'm confusing variables here. let me check.
the radial velocity semi-amplitude of the star is given by: k_* = ( (g * (m_p) ) / ( (m_* + m_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) * p^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * (sin i) but this seems complicated. alternatively, the relation between the planet's orbital parameters and the stellar velocity can be simplified when the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass (which is usually the case). then, m_p << m_*, so we can approximate (1 + m_p/m_*)^(-1/3) ≈ 1 - (1/3)(m_p/m_*). but since the problem states that both planets have masses similar to neptune and the stars have masses similar to the sun, the approximation might hold because neptune-mass planets are much less massive than the sun.
therefore, the velocity semi-amplitude k (which is the maximum velocity of the star) is approximately: k ≈ ( (g * m_p * sin i ) / ( (m_*)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) * p^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) )
wait, maybe i need to recall that the relation between the star's velocity semi-amplitude (k) and the planet's properties is: k = ( (g * p ) / (2 * π) )^(1/3) * ( m_p sin i / (m_* + m_p) )^(1/3) )
but again, with m_p << m_*, this simplifies to: k ≈ ( (g * p ) / (2 * π) )^(1/3) * ( m_p sin i / m_* )^(1/3) ) )
but the problem states that both planets have masses similar to neptune, and the stars have masses similar to the sun. since neptune's mass is much less than the sun's mass (neptune's mass is about 17 earth masses, sun's is ~333,000 earth masses), so the approximation m_p << m_* holds. therefore, we can use: k ∝ (m_p / m_*)^(1/3) * (1 / p^(1/3)) )
but both planets here have similar masses (similar to neptune), and the stars have similar masses (similar to the sun). therefore, the term (m_p / m_*) is the same for both planets. therefore, the velocity semi-amplitudes (k1 and k2) are inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital periods (p1 and p2).
that is, k ∝ 1 / p^(1/3). therefore, k1 / k2 = (p2 / p1)^(1/3)
so, solving for the period ratio: (p2 / p1) = (k1 / k2)^3
but in the problem, the observed quantity is the wavelength shift, which is proportional to the velocity. therefore, δλ is proportional to k.
given that δλ1 = 5 milliangstroms and δλ2 = 7 milliangstroms. so, the ratio of k1 to k2 is 5/7.
therefore, (p2 / p1) = (5/7)^3
calculating that: first, 5^3 = 125, 7^3 = 343. therefore, 125 / 343 ≈ 0.3644
but the question asks: "how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?"
wait, hold on. if (p2 / p1) = (k1 / k2)^3 = (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.3644, that would mean p2 is approximately 0.3644 times p1. but that would mean planet 2's period is shorter, but the options include ~1.96 and ~1.40. wait, this seems contradictory. wait, perhaps i mixed up the ratio.
wait, the formula derived above is (p2 / p1) = (k1 / k2)^3. since k is inversely proportional to p^(1/3), so if k1 / k2 = (p2 / p1)^(1/3), which rearranges to (p2 / p1) = (k1 / k2)^3
but in the problem, the wavelength shifts are given. since δλ ∝ k, the ratio of the shifts is k1/k2 = 5/7. therefore, substituting into the equation: (p2 / p1) = (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.3644. therefore, p2 is approximately 0.3644 times p1, meaning planet 2's period is about 0.36 times that of planet 1. however, the question asks "how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" so if p2 is 0.36 times p1, then planet #2's period is shorter, but the question is asking how many times longer. if the answer is a fraction less than 1, that would mean shorter, but the options given are ~0.36, which is c, and d is ~0.8. the exact reciprocal would be 1 / 0.3644 ≈ 2.74, which isn't an option. wait, but the calculation leads to p2 being about 0.36 times p1, so the ratio of p2 to p1 is 0.36. therefore, the answer is c) ~0.36.
wait, but let me confirm once again. the rv method: the velocity semi-amplitude k is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period. so if k is larger, the period is shorter. planet 1 has a smaller wavelength shift (5 ma) compared to planet 2 (7 ma). wait, wavelength shift is proportional to k, so a larger shift means the star is moving faster (larger k). so if planet 2's star has a larger shift (7 ma vs 5 ma), that means k2 is larger than k1. therefore, using the relation (p2 / p1) = (k1 / k2)^3, if k1 < k2, then (k1/k2) is less than 1, so (k1/k2)^3 is even smaller, so p2 / p1 is less than 1, meaning p2 is shorter than p1. but the question asks "how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" if p2 is shorter, the ratio is less than 1, so for example, if p2 is 0.36 times p1, then planet #2's period is 0.36 times as long, or 36% as long. therefore, the answer would be c.
but let me cross-check with another approach. using kepler's third law, which relates the orbital period to the semi-major axis. however, in the radial velocity method, the velocity semi-amplitude also depends on the inclination angle, but since we don't have information about that, we assume that the inclination angles are the same (but generally, inclination is unknown, but since both planets are in circular orbits and we don't have other info, maybe we can assume sin i is the same for both? wait, but the problem doesn't specify whether the orbits are edge-on or the inclination angles are known. hmm. however, in the rv method, the velocity semi-amplitude depends on sin i, but unless we have information about the inclination, we have to assume that the observed velocity amplitudes (k) are the same as the true velocities. but since the problem doesn't provide any information about inclination, we have to assume that sin i is the same for both, which is a common assumption when comparing two planets detected via rv if no additional information is given. so proceeding with that assumption.
so, given that k is proportional to (m_p / m_*)^(1/3) * (1 / p^(1/3)) )
but since both m_p and m_* are the same for both planets, the term (m_p / m_*)^(1/3) is the same. therefore, k is inversely proportional to p^(1/3). so, k1 / k2 = p2^(1/3) / p1^(1/3). therefore, (k1 / k2) = (p2 / p1)^(1/3). therefore, (p2 / p1) = (k1 / k2)^3.
now, the problem states that the wavelength shifts are 5 ma and 7 ma. since the wavelength shift δλ is proportional to the velocity v, and hence to k. therefore, k1 / k2 = δλ1 / δλ2 = 5 / 7.
therefore, (p2 / p1) = (5/7)^3 = (125) / (343) ≈ 0.364.
therefore, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it is shorter. so the answer is c) ~0.36.
but wait, the options are: a) ~ 1.96 b) ~ 1.40 c) ~ 0.36 d) ~ 0.8

<conclusion>
the calculation of (5/7)^3 yields approximately 0.364. this value for p2/p1 indicates planet 2's period is ~0.36 times planet 1's, consistent with the result. the formula k ∝ 1/p^(1/3) is applicable given the problem's conditions. the proportionality δλ ∝ k is valid. the inclination angle assumption is reasonable. the similarity of planet and stellar masses allows (m_p/m_*)^(1/3) to be treated as constant for both. the negligible eccentricity (e≈0) for circular orbits is a valid assumption.

therefore, the final answer is \boxed{c}

answer: to determine how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, we use the relationship between the radial velocity (rv) method and the orbital period. the key steps are as follows:

1. **relationship between velocity semi-amplitude (k) and orbital period (p):**
   the velocity semi-amplitude \( k \) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period \( p \). this relationship is given by:
   \[
   k \propto \left( \frac{1}{p^{1/3}} \right)
   \]
   therefore, the ratio of the semi-amplitudes \( \frac{k_1}{k_2} \) is proportional to the ratio of the cube roots of the periods \( \left( \frac{p_2}{p_1} \right)^{1/3} \right) \).

2. **proportionality of wavelength shift to velocity:**
   the periodic wavelength shift (δλ) is proportional to the velocity semi-amplitude \( k \). given the shifts for planet #1 and planet #2 are 5 ma and 7 ma respectively, we have:
   \[
   \frac{k_1}{k_2} = \frac{\delta\lambda_1}{\delta\lambda_2} = \frac{5}{7}
   \]

3. **solving for the period ratio:**
   using the relationship derived from the rv method:
   \[
   \frac{k_1}{k_2} = \left( \frac{p_2}{p_1} \right)^{1/3}
   \]
   cubing both sides to solve for \( \frac{p_2}{p_1} \):
   \[
   \left( \frac{5}{7} \right)^3 = \frac{p_2}{p_1}
   \]
   calculating the cube:
   \[
   \left( \frac{5}{7} \right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
   \]

thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1, indicating it is shorter. 

the final answer is \boxed{c}
