Okay, so I have this physics problem here about nuclear fission and calculating the kinetic energy difference between relativistic and non-relativistic approaches.
Let's see, how do I tackle this?
First, let me parse the problem step by step.
An atomic nucleus with mass M is at rest.
Its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV.
Then it undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments.
One fragment is twice as massive as the other.
The sum of the rest masses of these two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M.
So, 1% of the mass is converted into energy, right?
That's where the kinetic energy of the fragments comes from.
The question is asking for the difference between the correct (relativistic) kinetic energy of the more massive fragment and the kinetic energy calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation.
So, I need to compute both the relativistic and classical kinetic energies and find their difference.
The answer choices are in MeV, so the difference is somewhere between 2 to 20 MeV.
Alright.
Let me start by setting up the problem.
Given:
- Initial rest mass energy: M c2 = 300 GeV.
- The two fragments have rest masses m1 and m2, with m1 = 2 m2.
- The total rest mass after fission is 0.99 M.
So, m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.
Since m1 = 2 m2, substituting gives 2 m2 + m2 = 0.99 M => 3 m2 = 0.99 M => m2 = (0.99 / 3) M = 0.33 M.
Therefore, m1 = 2 * 0.33 M = 0.66 M.
So the two fragments have masses 0.66 M and 0.33 M.
But actually, the problem says the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M, so that accounts for the other 1% being released as energy.
Now, since the nucleus was initially at rest, the total momentum before the fission is zero.
Therefore, the total momentum after the fission must also be zero (conservation of momentum).
So the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta.
Let's denote the momentum of each fragment as p1 and p2.
Since they are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, |p1| = |p2| = p.
But their masses are different, so their velocities will be different.
In the non-relativistic case, kinetic energy is (1/2) m v2, which is related to momentum p = m v as T = p2 / (2m).
Since they have the same momentum p, the kinetic energies will be T1 = p2/(2 m1) and T2 = p2/(2 m2).
But since m1 = 2 m2, T1 = p2/(2*(2 m2)) = p2/(4 m2), and T2 = p2/(2 m2).
So T2 = 2 T1.
The kinetic energy is distributed such that the lighter fragment has twice the kinetic energy of the more massive one.
But in relativity, it's different.
Because relativistic kinetic energy is (γ - 1) m c2, and momentum is γ m v.
So the relationship between momentum and kinetic energy is more complicated.
So we need to compute the relativistic kinetic energy T1 for the more massive fragment (m1) and then compare it with the non-relativistic approximation.
Then find the difference between the two.
First, let's compute the non-relativistic T1.
Then compute the relativistic T1.
Then take the difference.
But how do we find the momentum p in the first place?
Since the total momentum is conserved and was zero initially, the total momentum after fission is also zero.
So the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta.
So even in relativity, the momentum magnitudes are equal.
But energy is also conserved.
The initial rest energy is M c2 = 300 GeV.
After fission, the total energy must be equal to the sum of the rest energies and kinetic energies of the two fragments.
However, the problem states that the sum of the rest masses is 0.99 M.
So the sum of rest energies is 0.99 M c2.
Therefore, the total kinetic energy should be (1 - 0.99) M c2 = 0.01 M c2 = 0.01 * 300 GeV = 3 GeV.
So the total kinetic energy of both fragments is 3 GeV.
But in non-relativistic terms, the kinetic energy would be distributed as T1 + T2 = 3 GeV, with T2 = 2 T1, so T1 + 2 T1 = 3 T1 = 3 GeV => T1 = 1 GeV.
Wait, but hold on.
Is that correct?
Wait, but let me check.
If the rest mass energy is 300 GeV, and the rest mass after fission is 0.99 of original, so mass defect is 0.01 M, so the energy released is 0.01 * 300 GeV = 3 GeV.
All right, that's the total kinetic energy.
In non-relativistic case, since the two fragments have a mass ratio of 2:1, the kinetic energy would be distributed inversely with mass, so the more massive fragment has less kinetic energy.
Specifically, since momentum is conserved, their momenta are equal in magnitude.
So T = p2 / (2m).
Therefore, T1 = p2 / (2 m1), T2 = p2 / (2 m2).
Since m2 = m1 / 2, T2 = p2 / (2 * (m1 / 2)) = p2 / m1 = 2 T1.
So T2 = 2 T1.
Therefore, total kinetic energy is T1 + T2 = 3 T1 = 3 GeV => T1 = 1 GeV.
So non-relativistic T1 is 1 GeV.
Now, the correct relativistic T1 would be different.
So we need to compute the relativistic kinetic energy T1, given that the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV, and then find the difference between this T1 and 1 GeV.
But how do we compute the relativistic case?
Wait, in the relativistic case, the total energy includes rest mass and kinetic energy.
So initial energy is M c2 = 300 GeV.
After fission, the total energy is (m1 + m2) c2 + T1 + T2 = 0.99 M c2 + T1 + T2.
But since the mass defect is 0.01 M, the energy released is 0.01 M c2 = 3 GeV, which is equal to the total kinetic energy, so T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.
Wait, but this seems non-relativistic.
Wait, actually, in relativity, the total energy is the sum of the relativistic energies of each fragment.
So, initial energy is M c2 = 300 GeV.
After fission, the total energy is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two fragments, which is m1 c2 + T1 + m2 c2 + T2 = (m1 + m2) c2 + T1 + T2 = 0.99 M c2 + T1 + T2.
But by conservation of energy, this must equal the initial energy, 300 GeV.
Therefore, 0.99 M c2 + T1 + T2 = M c2 => T1 + T2 = (M - 0.99 M) c2 = 0.01 M c2 = 3 GeV.
So same as before.
So the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV.
But how is this shared between the two fragments?
In relativity, the distribution is not inverse mass.
Because the relation between momentum and kinetic energy is different.
So even though their momenta are equal in magnitude, the kinetic energy is not simply p2/(2m).
So we need to use the relativistic formulas.
Let me recall that in relativity, the momentum p is related to the energy E by p = sqrt(E2 - (m c2)^2)/c.
Alternatively, kinetic energy T = (gamma - 1) m c2, and p = gamma m v.
Alternatively, the relation between p and T can be expressed as E = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ) = T + m c2.
So, pc = sqrt( (T + m c2)^2 - (m c2)^2 ) = sqrt( T^2 + 2 T m c2 ).
Hmm, maybe not the easiest form.
Alternatively, gamma can be written in terms of kinetic energy.
Since T = (gamma - 1) m c2,
gamma = 1 + T/(m c2).
Then, momentum p = gamma m v.
But we can also relate v to T.
Let's see:
gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v2/c2)) = 1 + T/(m c2).
Hmm, but for small velocities, this would approximate to gamma ≈ 1 + (1/2) m v2/(m c2) ) = 1 + T/(c2), where T is the non-relativistic kinetic energy, (1/2) m v2.
But in our case, the kinetic energy is 3 GeV total, split between two fragments.
The rest mass energy of the fragments is given.
For the more massive fragment, m1 c2 would be?
Since m1 = 0.66 M, and M c2 = 300 GeV, so m1 c2 = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV.
Similarly, m2 c2 = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.
So the rest mass energy of fragment 1 is 198 GeV, fragment 2 is 99 GeV.
The total kinetic energy is 3 GeV, so 3 GeV is shared between T1 and T2.
In non-relativistic case, T1 = 1 GeV, T2 = 2 GeV.
In relativistic case, the relation between their kinetic energies is different.
But how do we find the relativistic kinetic energies?
We know that for each fragment, the total energy is E = gamma m c2.
The momentum is p = gamma m v.
Since the two fragments have equal and opposite momenta, their momenta magnitudes are equal, so p1 = p2 = p.
Therefore, gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.
But since m1 = 2 m2, gamma1 * 2 m2 * v1 = gamma2 m2 * v2 => 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.
Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated.
Let me use variables.
Let me denote m2 = m, so m1 = 2m.
Wait, earlier we found that m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.
So if m2 = m, then m1 = 2m, so 2m + m = 0.99 M => 3m = 0.99 M => m = 0.33 M.
So m1 = 0.66 M and m2 = 0.33 M.
But their energies:
For each fragment, the total energy is E1 = gamma1 * m1 c2 and E2 = gamma2 * m2 c2.
The kinetic energies are T1 = (gamma1 - 1) m1 c2 and T2 = (gamma2 - 1) m2 c2.
Total kinetic energy is T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.
Also, as momenta are equal in magnitude, p1 = p2 = p.
Relating gamma to momentum:
gamma = sqrt(1 + (p/(m c2))^2 )
Wait, let me recall the relation between gamma and momentum.
The relativistic energy-momentum relation is (E)^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c2)^2.
For each particle, E = gamma m c2, so (gamma m c2)^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c2)^2.
Dividing both sides by m2 c^4, we get (gamma^2) = (p^2 c^2)/(m2 c^4) + 1 => gamma^2 = (p^2)/(m2 c2) + 1.
Therefore, gamma = sqrt(1 + (p^2)/(m2 c2)).
But since the two particles have the same momentum p, their gammas are gamma1 = sqrt(1 + (p2)/(m12 c2)) and gamma2 = sqrt(1 + (p2)/(m22 c2)).
But m2 = m and m1 = 2m, since m2 is the smaller mass.
Wait, no.
Wait, earlier, we said m1 = 0.66 M and m2 = 0.33 M.
But in terms of their rest masses, m1 is twice m2.
So, if m2 = m, then m1 = 2m.
Wait, let me check:
If m2 = 0.33 M, then m1 = 0.66 M, so m1 = 2 * (0.33 M) = 0.66 M.
So yes, m1 is twice m2.
Therefore, m1 = 2 m2.
Let me denote m2 = m.
Then m1 = 2m.
So:
gamma1 = sqrt(1 + (p2)/( (2m)^2 c2 )) = sqrt(1 + (p2)/(4 m2 c2 ))
gamma2 = sqrt(1 + (p2)/( m2 c2 )) = sqrt(1 + (p2)/( m2 c2 ))
Now, the kinetic energies are:
T1 = (gamma1 - 1) (2m) c2
T2 = (gamma2 - 1) (m) c2
And we know that T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.
So, substituting:
( gamma1 - 1 ) 2m c2 + ( gamma2 - 1 ) m c2 = 3 GeV
Factor out m c2:
m c2 [ 2 (gamma1 - 1) + (gamma2 - 1) ] = 3 GeV
We know that m c2 is the rest mass energy of the smaller fragment.
Since m2 = 0.33 M, and M c2 = 300 GeV, so m c2 = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV.
So m c2 = 99 GeV.
Therefore:
99 GeV * [ 2 gamma1 - 2 + gamma2 - 1 ] = 3 GeV
Simplify:
99 GeV * [ 2 gamma1 + gamma2 - 3 ] = 3 GeV
Therefore:
2 gamma1 + gamma2 - 3 = 3 GeV / 99 GeV = 3/99 = 1/33 ≈ 0.0303
So, equation 1:
2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 3 + 1/33 = 3.0303
But we have expressions for gamma1 and gamma2 in terms of p.
Let's write them:
gamma1 = sqrt(1 + (p2)/(4 m2 c2 ))
gamma2 = sqrt(1 + (p2)/(m2 c2 ))
But p is the same for both.
However, we need another equation to relate gamma1 and gamma2, or to solve for p.
Wait, but the problem is we have two equations: the energy conservation (with T1 + T2 = 3 GeV) which translates to the equation above, and the relation between gamma1, gamma2, and p.
But we need another equation.
However, since the momentum is the same for both fragments, perhaps we can relate their velocities.
Alternatively, since the system's total momentum is zero, the vector sum of the momenta of the two fragments is zero.
So their momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.
Therefore, each fragment has momentum p, but let's consider the magnitude.
So we can write expressions for gamma1 and gamma2 in terms of p, and then try to solve for p from the energy equation.
So, from equation 1:
2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 3 + 1/33 ≈ 3.0303
But we need to express gamma1 and gamma2 in terms of p.
However, we can note that:
gamma1 = sqrt(1 + (p2)/(4 m2 c2 ))
gamma2 = sqrt(1 + (p2)/(m2 c2 ))
Let me denote x = (p/(2 m c))2.
Then:
gamma1 = sqrt(1 + x )
gamma2 = sqrt(1 + 4x )
Because, (p/(2 m c))2 = (p2)/(4 m2 c2 ) = x.
So if gamma1 = sqrt(1 + x), then gamma2 = sqrt(1 + 4 x).
Therefore, substituting into equation 1:
2 sqrt(1 + x ) + sqrt(1 + 4 x ) = 3.0303
This is a single equation with one variable x.
Let me solve for x.
Let me set variables:
Let’s let y = sqrt(1 + x), then sqrt(1 + 4x ) can be expressed in terms of y.
Since y = sqrt(1 + x), y2 = 1 + x => x = y2 - 1.
Then sqrt(1 + 4x ) = sqrt(1 + 4 (y2 - 1)) = sqrt(1 + 4 y2 -4 ) = sqrt(4 y2 - 3 )
Therefore, the equation becomes:
2 y + sqrt(4 y2 - 3 ) = 3.0303
Hmm, this might be solvable.
Let me square both sides:
(2 y + sqrt(4 y2 - 3 ))^2 = (3.0303)^2
Expanding the left side:
4 y2 + 4 y sqrt(4 y2 - 3 ) + (4 y2 - 3 ) = 8 y2 + 4 y sqrt(4 y2 - 3 ) - 3
Right side is approximately (3 + 0.03)^2 = 9 + 0.6 + 0.0009 ≈ 9.6009 GeV2.
Therefore:
8 y2 + 4 y sqrt(4 y2 - 3 ) - 3 ≈ 9.6009
Bring all terms to left side:
8 y2 + 4 y sqrt(4 y2 - 3 ) - 3 - 9.6009 = 0
Simplify:
8 y2 + 4 y sqrt(4 y2 - 3 ) - 12.6009 = 0
Subtract 8 y2:
4 y sqrt(4 y2 - 3 ) = 12.6009 - 8 y2
Now, square both sides again:
16 y2 (4 y2 - 3 ) = (12.6009 - 8 y2 )2
Left side:
64 y^6 - 48 y2
Right side:
(12.6009)^2 - 2 * 12.6009 * 8 y2 + (8 y2 )^2
Calculate each term:
(12.6009)^2 ≈ 158.79 (since 12^2 = 144, 12.6^2 = 158.76; 12.6009 ≈ 12.6, so close)
- 2 * 12.6009 *8 y2 ≈ - 201.6144 y2
+ 64 y^4
Therefore:
Left side: 64 y^6 - 48 y2
Right side: 158.79 - 201.6144 y2 + 64 y^4
Bring all terms to left side:
64 y^6 - 48 y2 - 158.79 + 201.6144 y2 - 64 y^4 = 0
Combine like terms:
64 y^6 -64 y^4 + (201.6144 - 48) y2 - 158.79 = 0
Calculate:
64 y^6 -64 y^4 + 153.6144 y2 - 158.79 = 0
This is a cubic equation in y2.
Let z = y2.
Then:
64 z^3 -64 z^2 + 153.6144 z - 158.79 = 0
This is a cubic equation in z.
Solving this cubic equation may be complicated, but perhaps we can approximate.
Given that the kinetic energy is 3 GeV, which is much smaller than the rest mass energies (198 GeV and 99 GeV).
So the velocities are non-relativistic, hence gamma is approximately 1.
Therefore, the momenta would be approximately p ≈ gamma m v ≈ m v.
Therefore, maybe we can approximate.
Alternatively, since the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV, compared to rest mass energies of 198 GeV and 99 GeV, which are much larger.
So the gamma factors are approximately 1 + T/(2 m c2 ) from the non-relativistic approximation of gamma ≈ 1 + (v2)/(2 c2 ) and p ≈ m v.
Wait, let's check.
For the first fragment, T1 = (gamma1 - 1) m1 c2.
If gamma1 -1 is small, then T1 ≈ (gamma1 -1 ) * m1 c2.
Similarly for T2.
Given that T1 + T2 = 3 GeV, which is small compared to m1 c2 =198 GeV and m2 c2=99 GeV, so we can approximate gamma1 -1 ≈ T1/(m1 c2 ) and gamma2 -1 ≈ T2/(m2 c2 ).
Then, the total gamma correction is small.
But let's see.
But in the equation 2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 3 + 1/33 ≈ 3.0303.
If gamma1 ≈ 1 and gamma2 ≈ 1, then 2*1 +1=3, which is close.
The actual value is 3.0303, so gamma1 and gamma2 are slightly larger than 1.
Therefore, we can linearize the equations.
Let’s write gamma1 = 1 + epsilon1 and gamma2 = 1 + epsilon2.
Then, 2(1 + epsilon1) + (1 + epsilon2) = 3.0303
Which gives 2 + 2 epsilon1 +1 + epsilon2 = 3.0303 => 3 + 3 epsilon1 + epsilon2 = 3.0303 => 3 epsilon1 + epsilon2 ≈ 0.0303
Also, since T1 = epsilon1 m1 c2 and T2 = epsilon2 m2 c2.
And T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.
So, epsilon1 * m1 c2 + epsilon2 * m2 c2 = 3 GeV.
Substituting m1 c2 =198 GeV, m2 c2=99 GeV:
198 epsilon1 +99 epsilon2 =3.
Divide by 99:
2 epsilon1 + epsilon2 = 3/99 =1/33 ≈ 0.0303.
So now we have two equations:
1) 3 epsilon1 + epsilon2 = 0.0303
2) 2 epsilon1 + epsilon2 = 0.0303
Subtract equation 2 from equation 1:
(3 epsilon1 + epsilon2) - (2 epsilon1 + epsilon2) = 0.0303 - 0.0303
Which gives epsilon1 =0.
Wait, that can't be.
That would imply epsilon1=0, which would give epsilon2=0.0303.
But substituting back, that can't be.
Wait, there must be a mistake here.
Wait, in equation 2, if T1 + T2 =3 GeV, and T1 = epsilon1 * 198 GeV, T2=epsilon2 * 99 GeV, then 198 epsilon1 +99 epsilon2 =3.
But 198= 2*99, so 2*99*epsilon1 +99 epsilon2=3 => 99*(18 epsilon1 + epsilon2)=3 => 18 epsilon1 + epsilon2=3/99=1/33≈0.0303.
Wait, no.
Wait, 198 epsilon1 +99 epsilon2=3.
Divide both sides by 99: 2 epsilon1 + epsilon2=3/99=1/33≈0.0303.
Okay, so equation 2 is 2 epsilon1 + epsilon2≈0.0303.
But from equation 1, derived from 2 gamma1 +gamma2=3.0303, which after linearization gives 3 epsilon1 + epsilon2=0.0303.
Therefore, equations:
1) 3 epsilon1 + epsilon2=0.0303
2) 2 epsilon1 + epsilon2=0.0303
Subtract equation 2 from equation 1:
(3 epsilon1 + epsilon2) - (2 epsilon1 + epsilon2)=0.0303 -0.0303
Which gives epsilon1=0.
Which would imply that epsilon2=0.0303.
But substituting back into equation 2: 2*0 + epsilon2=0.0303, which is consistent.
But epsilon1=0 implies that gamma1=1, which means T1=0.
But this contradicts the fact that T1 + T2=3 GeV.
So if epsilon1=0, then T1=0, so T2=3 GeV, which would imply that all the kinetic energy goes to the lighter fragment.
But this is inconsistent with momentum conservation.
Wait, there must be a mistake in the approach.
Wait, the problem is that when we linearize, we are assuming that epsilon1 and epsilon2 are small.
But if epsilon1=0, then epsilon2=0.0303, which is not negligible compared to the energy.
Let's check how big that is.
The rest mass energy of the second fragment is 99 GeV.
So, T2= epsilon2 * m2 c2=0.0303 *99 GeV≈3 GeV.
Which is exactly the total energy released.
So, all the kinetic energy would go to the lighter fragment, which is unphysical.
Because if all the kinetic energy is given to the lighter fragment, then its energy would be 3 GeV, and the momentum would be high.
But the other fragment would have zero kinetic energy, so momentum would be zero.
Which violates momentum conservation.
Therefore, this approach is flawed.
Therefore, the linearization is invalid.
Therefore, we need a better approach.
So, since the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV, and the rest mass energies are 198 GeV and 99 GeV, which are much larger, so the velocities are indeed non-relativistic, but not strictly non-relativistic.
So maybe we need a better approximation.
Alternatively, let's compute the exact relativistic result.
Given that p1 = p2 = p.
Therefore, for each fragment:
E1 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m1 c2 )^2 )
E2 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m2 c2 )^2 )
The kinetic energies are T1 = E1 - m1 c2 and T2 = E2 - m2 c2.
And T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.
So:
sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m1 c2 )^2 ) - m1 c2 + sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m2 c2 )^2 ) - m2 c2 = 3 GeV
Which can be written as:
sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m1 c2 )^2 ) + sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m2 c2 )^2 ) = 3 GeV + m1 c2 + m2 c2
But m1 c2 + m2 c2 = 0.99 M c2 =0.99*300=297 GeV.
Therefore:
sqrt( (p c)^2 + 198^2 ) + sqrt( (p c)^2 + 99^2 ) = 3 + 297 = 300 GeV
Where all terms are in GeV, and (p c) is in GeV·cm/s (but units will work out with appropriate c factors).
Let’s denote x = p c in GeV·cm/s.
Then:
sqrt( x2 + 1982 ) + sqrt( x2 + 992 ) = 300
We can solve for x.
Let me set this up:
sqrt( x2 + (198)^2 ) + sqrt( x2 + (99)^2 ) = 300
Let me divide both sides by c to get x in terms of GeV s/cm.
Wait, but actually, units might complicate.
Alternatively, non-dimensionalize by dividing through 99 GeV:
Let’s let y = x / (99 GeV).
Then:
sqrt( (99 y)^2 +198^2 ) + sqrt( (99 y)^2 +99^2 ) =300
Which simplifies:
sqrt( 99^2 y2 + 198^2 ) + sqrt( 99^2 y2 +99^2 )=300
Factor out 99^2:
sqrt( 99^2 ( y2 + 4 )) + sqrt( 99^2 ( y2 +1 )) =300
Which becomes:
99 sqrt( y2 +4 ) +99 sqrt( y2 +1 )=300
Factor out 99:
99( sqrt( y2 +4 ) + sqrt( y2 +1 ) )=300
Therefore:
sqrt( y2 +4 ) + sqrt( y2 +1 )=300/99≈3.0303
This is the same equation as before.
So we need to solve for y.
Let me square both sides:
[ sqrt( y2 +4 ) + sqrt( y2 +1 ) ]^2 = (3.0303)^2
Expanding:
(y2 +4) + (y2 +1 ) + 2 sqrt{(y2 +4)(y2 +1)} ≈9.183
Simplify:
2 y2 +5 + 2 sqrt{(y2 +4)(y2 +1)} ≈9.183
Therefore:
2 sqrt{(y2 +4)(y2 +1)} ≈9.183 -2 y2 -5 ≈4.183 -2 y2
Now, let’s square both sides again:
4 (y2 +4)(y2 +1 ) ≈(4.183 -2 y2 )^2
Left side:
4 (y^4 +5 y2 +4 )
Right side:
(4.183)^2 -2*4.183*2 y2 +4 y^4
Calculate:
Left side:4 y^4 +20 y2 +16
Right side:17.495 -16.732 y2 +4 y^4
Bring all terms to left side:
4 y^4 +20 y2 +16 -17.495 +16.732 y2 -4 y^4 >= 0
Simplify:
(4 y^4 -4 y^4 ) + (20 y2 +16.732 y2 ) + (16 -17.495 )=36.732 y2 -1.495=0
Therefore:
36.732 y2 =1.495
Thus:
y2≈1.495 /36.732≈0.0407
Therefore:
y≈0.2017
Recall that y=x/(99 GeV), where x=p c.
Therefore, x= y *99 GeV=0.2017 *99 GeV≈20 GeV.
Therefore, p c≈20 GeV.
So the momentum p is approximately 20 GeV/c.
Now, compute the relativistic kinetic energy T1 for the more massive fragment.
T1 = (gamma1 -1) m1 c2.
First, compute gamma1:
gamma1 = sqrt(1 + (p^2 c2 )/( m12 c^4 )) = sqrt(1 + ( (p c )^2 )/( m12 c^4 ) *c^4 ? Wait, let me be careful with units.
Actually, the expression for gamma is:
gamma = sqrt(1 + (p^2 c^2)/(m^2 c^4 )) = sqrt(1 + (p^2)/(m^2 c^2 ))
But need to plug in proper units.
Alternatively, in natural units where c=1, but here we have to manage units.
Alternatively, since we have pc in GeV cm/s (but actually, commonly pc is used in GeV).
Assuming c=1 in those units.
Wait, in particle physics, it's common to use units where c=1, so masses are in GeV/c2, and momentum in GeV/c.
Then, pc is in GeV.
So if pc=20 GeV, then (pc)^2=400 GeV2.
The rest mass of fragment 1 is m1 c2=198 GeV, so (m1 c2 )^2=198^2=39204 GeV2.
Then, the energy E1= sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m1 c2 )^2 )=sqrt(400 + 39204)=sqrt(39604)=199 GeV.
Therefore, kinetic energy T1 = E1 - m1 c2=199 -198=1 GeV.
Similarly for fragment 2:
E2= sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m2 c2 )^2 )=sqrt(400 + 99^2)=sqrt(400 +9801)=sqrt(10201)=101 GeV.
Thus, T2=E2 -m2 c2=101 -99=2 GeV.
So total kinetic energy T1 + T2=1 +2=3 GeV, which checks out.
Therefore, the relativistic calculation gives T1=1 GeV, same as the non-relativistic case.
Wait, that can't be.
Because we just did the relativistic calculation and found that T1=1 GeV, which is the same as the non-relativistic result.
But this contradicts the expectation that relativistic effects would divide energy differently.
But in this case, even though the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV, which is small compared to the rest mass energies (198 GeV and 99 GeV), the distribution of

okay, so i have this physics problem here about nuclear fission and calculating the kinetic energy difference between relativistic and non-relativistic approaches.
let's see, how do i tackle this?
first, let me parse the problem step by step.
an atomic nucleus with mass m is at rest.
its rest-mass energy is 300 gev.
then it undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments.
one fragment is twice as massive as the other.
the sum of the rest masses of these two fragments is 99% of the initial mass m.
so, 1% of the mass is converted into energy, right?
that's where the kinetic energy of the fragments comes from.
the question is asking for the difference between the correct (relativistic) kinetic energy of the more massive fragment and the kinetic energy calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation.
so, i need to compute both the relativistic and classical kinetic energies and find their difference.
the answer choices are in mev, so the difference is somewhere between 2 to 20 mev.
alright.
let me start by setting up the problem.
given:
- initial rest mass energy: m c2 = 300 gev.
- the two fragments have rest masses m1 and m2, with m1 = 2 m2.
- the total rest mass after fission is 0.99 m.
so, m1 + m2 = 0.99 m.
since m1 = 2 m2, substituting gives 2 m2 + m2 = 0.99 m => 3 m2 = 0.99 m => m2 = (0.99 / 3) m = 0.33 m.
therefore, m1 = 2 * 0.33 m = 0.66 m.
so the two fragments have masses 0.66 m and 0.33 m.
but actually, the problem says the sum of their rest masses is 99% of m, so that accounts for the other 1% being released as energy.
now, since the nucleus was initially at rest, the total momentum before the fission is zero.
therefore, the total momentum after the fission must also be zero (conservation of momentum).
so the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta.
let's denote the momentum of each fragment as p1 and p2.
since they are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, |p1| = |p2| = p.
but their masses are different, so their velocities will be different.
in the non-relativistic case, kinetic energy is (1/2) m v2, which is related to momentum p = m v as t = p2 / (2m).
since they have the same momentum p, the kinetic energies will be t1 = p2/(2 m1) and t2 = p2/(2 m2).
but since m1 = 2 m2, t1 = p2/(2*(2 m2)) = p2/(4 m2), and t2 = p2/(2 m2).
so t2 = 2 t1.
the kinetic energy is distributed such that the lighter fragment has twice the kinetic energy of the more massive one.
but in relativity, it's different.
because relativistic kinetic energy is (γ - 1) m c2, and momentum is γ m v.
so the relationship between momentum and kinetic energy is more complicated.
so we need to compute the relativistic kinetic energy t1 for the more massive fragment (m1) and then compare it with the non-relativistic approximation.
then find the difference between the two.
first, let's compute the non-relativistic t1.
then compute the relativistic t1.
then take the difference.
but how do we find the momentum p in the first place?
since the total momentum is conserved and was zero initially, the total momentum after fission is also zero.
so the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta.
so even in relativity, the momentum magnitudes are equal.
but energy is also conserved.
the initial rest energy is m c2 = 300 gev.
after fission, the total energy must be equal to the sum of the rest energies and kinetic energies of the two fragments.
however, the problem states that the sum of the rest masses is 0.99 m.
so the sum of rest energies is 0.99 m c2.
therefore, the total kinetic energy should be (1 - 0.99) m c2 = 0.01 m c2 = 0.01 * 300 gev = 3 gev.
so the total kinetic energy of both fragments is 3 gev.
but in non-relativistic terms, the kinetic energy would be distributed as t1 + t2 = 3 gev, with t2 = 2 t1, so t1 + 2 t1 = 3 t1 = 3 gev => t1 = 1 gev.
wait, but hold on.
is that correct?
wait, but let me check.
if the rest mass energy is 300 gev, and the rest mass after fission is 0.99 of original, so mass defect is 0.01 m, so the energy released is 0.01 * 300 gev = 3 gev.
all right, that's the total kinetic energy.
in non-relativistic case, since the two fragments have a mass ratio of 2:1, the kinetic energy would be distributed inversely with mass, so the more massive fragment has less kinetic energy.
specifically, since momentum is conserved, their momenta are equal in magnitude.
so t = p2 / (2m).
therefore, t1 = p2 / (2 m1), t2 = p2 / (2 m2).
since m2 = m1 / 2, t2 = p2 / (2 * (m1 / 2)) = p2 / m1 = 2 t1.
so t2 = 2 t1.
therefore, total kinetic energy is t1 + t2 = 3 t1 = 3 gev => t1 = 1 gev.
so non-relativistic t1 is 1 gev.
now, the correct relativistic t1 would be different.
so we need to compute the relativistic kinetic energy t1, given that the total kinetic energy is 3 gev, and then find the difference between this t1 and 1 gev.
but how do we compute the relativistic case?
wait, in the relativistic case, the total energy includes rest mass and kinetic energy.
so initial energy is m c2 = 300 gev.
after fission, the total energy is (m1 + m2) c2 + t1 + t2 = 0.99 m c2 + t1 + t2.
but since the mass defect is 0.01 m, the energy released is 0.01 m c2 = 3 gev, which is equal to the total kinetic energy, so t1 + t2 = 3 gev.
wait, but this seems non-relativistic.
wait, actually, in relativity, the total energy is the sum of the relativistic energies of each fragment.
so, initial energy is m c2 = 300 gev.
after fission, the total energy is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two fragments, which is m1 c2 + t1 + m2 c2 + t2 = (m1 + m2) c2 + t1 + t2 = 0.99 m c2 + t1 + t2.
but by conservation of energy, this must equal the initial energy, 300 gev.
therefore, 0.99 m c2 + t1 + t2 = m c2 => t1 + t2 = (m - 0.99 m) c2 = 0.01 m c2 = 3 gev.
so same as before.
so the total kinetic energy is 3 gev.
but how is this shared between the two fragments?
in relativity, the distribution is not inverse mass.
because the relation between momentum and kinetic energy is different.
so even though their momenta are equal in magnitude, the kinetic energy is not simply p2/(2m).
so we need to use the relativistic formulas.
let me recall that in relativity, the momentum p is related to the energy e by p = sqrt(e2 - (m c2)^2)/c.
alternatively, kinetic energy t = (gamma - 1) m c2, and p = gamma m v.
alternatively, the relation between p and t can be expressed as e = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ) = t + m c2.
so, pc = sqrt( (t + m c2)^2 - (m c2)^2 ) = sqrt( t^2 + 2 t m c2 ).
hmm, maybe not the easiest form.
alternatively, gamma can be written in terms of kinetic energy.
since t = (gamma - 1) m c2,
gamma = 1 + t/(m c2).
then, momentum p = gamma m v.
but we can also relate v to t.
let's see:
gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v2/c2)) = 1 + t/(m c2).
hmm, but for small velocities, this would approximate to gamma ≈ 1 + (1/2) m v2/(m c2) ) = 1 + t/(c2), where t is the non-relativistic kinetic energy, (1/2) m v2.
but in our case, the kinetic energy is 3 gev total, split between two fragments.
the rest mass energy of the fragments is given.
for the more massive fragment, m1 c2 would be?
since m1 = 0.66 m, and m c2 = 300 gev, so m1 c2 = 0.66 * 300 gev = 198 gev.
similarly, m2 c2 = 0.33 * 300 gev = 99 gev.
so the rest mass energy of fragment 1 is 198 gev, fragment 2 is 99 gev.
the total kinetic energy is 3 gev, so 3 gev is shared between t1 and t2.
in non-relativistic case, t1 = 1 gev, t2 = 2 gev.
in relativistic case, the relation between their kinetic energies is different.
but how do we find the relativistic kinetic energies?
we know that for each fragment, the total energy is e = gamma m c2.
the momentum is p = gamma m v.
since the two fragments have equal and opposite momenta, their momenta magnitudes are equal, so p1 = p2 = p.
therefore, gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.
but since m1 = 2 m2, gamma1 * 2 m2 * v1 = gamma2 m2 * v2 => 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.
hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated.
let me use variables.
let me denote m2 = m, so m1 = 2m.
wait, earlier we found that m1 + m2 = 0.99 m.
so if m2 = m, then m1 = 2m, so 2m + m = 0.99 m => 3m = 0.99 m => m = 0.33 m.
so m1 = 0.66 m and m2 = 0.33 m.
but their energies:
for each fragment, the total energy is e1 = gamma1 * m1 c2 and e2 = gamma2 * m2 c2.
the kinetic energies are t1 = (gamma1 - 1) m1 c2 and t2 = (gamma2 - 1) m2 c2.
total kinetic energy is t1 + t2 = 3 gev.
also, as momenta are equal in magnitude, p1 = p2 = p.
relating gamma to momentum:
gamma = sqrt(1 + (p/(m c2))^2 )
wait, let me recall the relation between gamma and momentum.
the relativistic energy-momentum relation is (e)^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c2)^2.
for each particle, e = gamma m c2, so (gamma m c2)^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c2)^2.
dividing both sides by m2 c^4, we get (gamma^2) = (p^2 c^2)/(m2 c^4) + 1 => gamma^2 = (p^2)/(m2 c2) + 1.
therefore, gamma = sqrt(1 + (p^2)/(m2 c2)).
but since the two particles have the same momentum p, their gammas are gamma1 = sqrt(1 + (p2)/(m12 c2)) and gamma2 = sqrt(1 + (p2)/(m22 c2)).
but m2 = m and m1 = 2m, since m2 is the smaller mass.
wait, no.
wait, earlier, we said m1 = 0.66 m and m2 = 0.33 m.
but in terms of their rest masses, m1 is twice m2.
so, if m2 = m, then m1 = 2m.
wait, let me check:
if m2 = 0.33 m, then m1 = 0.66 m, so m1 = 2 * (0.33 m) = 0.66 m.
so yes, m1 is twice m2.
therefore, m1 = 2 m2.
let me denote m2 = m.
then m1 = 2m.
so:
gamma1 = sqrt(1 + (p2)/( (2m)^2 c2 )) = sqrt(1 + (p2)/(4 m2 c2 ))
gamma2 = sqrt(1 + (p2)/( m2 c2 )) = sqrt(1 + (p2)/( m2 c2 ))
now, the kinetic energies are:
t1 = (gamma1 - 1) (2m) c2
t2 = (gamma2 - 1) (m) c2
and we know that t1 + t2 = 3 gev.
so, substituting:
( gamma1 - 1 ) 2m c2 + ( gamma2 - 1 ) m c2 = 3 gev
factor out m c2:
m c2 [ 2 (gamma1 - 1) + (gamma2 - 1) ] = 3 gev
we know that m c2 is the rest mass energy of the smaller fragment.
since m2 = 0.33 m, and m c2 = 300 gev, so m c2 = 0.33 * 300 gev = 99 gev.
so m c2 = 99 gev.
therefore:
99 gev * [ 2 gamma1 - 2 + gamma2 - 1 ] = 3 gev
simplify:
99 gev * [ 2 gamma1 + gamma2 - 3 ] = 3 gev
therefore:
2 gamma1 + gamma2 - 3 = 3 gev / 99 gev = 3/99 = 1/33 ≈ 0.0303
so, equation 1:
2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 3 + 1/33 = 3.0303
but we have expressions for gamma1 and gamma2 in terms of p.
let's write them:
gamma1 = sqrt(1 + (p2)/(4 m2 c2 ))
gamma2 = sqrt(1 + (p2)/(m2 c2 ))
but p is the same for both.
however, we need another equation to relate gamma1 and gamma2, or to solve for p.
wait, but the problem is we have two equations: the energy conservation (with t1 + t2 = 3 gev) which translates to the equation above, and the relation between gamma1, gamma2, and p.
but we need another equation.
however, since the momentum is the same for both fragments, perhaps we can relate their velocities.
alternatively, since the system's total momentum is zero, the vector sum of the momenta of the two fragments is zero.
so their momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.
therefore, each fragment has momentum p, but let's consider the magnitude.
so we can write expressions for gamma1 and gamma2 in terms of p, and then try to solve for p from the energy equation.
so, from equation 1:
2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 3 + 1/33 ≈ 3.0303
but we need to express gamma1 and gamma2 in terms of p.
however, we can note that:
gamma1 = sqrt(1 + (p2)/(4 m2 c2 ))
gamma2 = sqrt(1 + (p2)/(m2 c2 ))
let me denote x = (p/(2 m c))2.
then:
gamma1 = sqrt(1 + x )
gamma2 = sqrt(1 + 4x )
because, (p/(2 m c))2 = (p2)/(4 m2 c2 ) = x.
so if gamma1 = sqrt(1 + x), then gamma2 = sqrt(1 + 4 x).
therefore, substituting into equation 1:
2 sqrt(1 + x ) + sqrt(1 + 4 x ) = 3.0303
this is a single equation with one variable x.
let me solve for x.
let me set variables:
let’s let y = sqrt(1 + x), then sqrt(1 + 4x ) can be expressed in terms of y.
since y = sqrt(1 + x), y2 = 1 + x => x = y2 - 1.
then sqrt(1 + 4x ) = sqrt(1 + 4 (y2 - 1)) = sqrt(1 + 4 y2 -4 ) = sqrt(4 y2 - 3 )
therefore, the equation becomes:
2 y + sqrt(4 y2 - 3 ) = 3.0303
hmm, this might be solvable.
let me square both sides:
(2 y + sqrt(4 y2 - 3 ))^2 = (3.0303)^2
expanding the left side:
4 y2 + 4 y sqrt(4 y2 - 3 ) + (4 y2 - 3 ) = 8 y2 + 4 y sqrt(4 y2 - 3 ) - 3
right side is approximately (3 + 0.03)^2 = 9 + 0.6 + 0.0009 ≈ 9.6009 gev2.
therefore:
8 y2 + 4 y sqrt(4 y2 - 3 ) - 3 ≈ 9.6009
bring all terms to left side:
8 y2 + 4 y sqrt(4 y2 - 3 ) - 3 - 9.6009 = 0
simplify:
8 y2 + 4 y sqrt(4 y2 - 3 ) - 12.6009 = 0
subtract 8 y2:
4 y sqrt(4 y2 - 3 ) = 12.6009 - 8 y2
now, square both sides again:
16 y2 (4 y2 - 3 ) = (12.6009 - 8 y2 )2
left side:
64 y^6 - 48 y2
right side:
(12.6009)^2 - 2 * 12.6009 * 8 y2 + (8 y2 )^2
calculate each term:
(12.6009)^2 ≈ 158.79 (since 12^2 = 144, 12.6^2 = 158.76; 12.6009 ≈ 12.6, so close)
- 2 * 12.6009 *8 y2 ≈ - 201.6144 y2
+ 64 y^4
therefore:
left side: 64 y^6 - 48 y2
right side: 158.79 - 201.6144 y2 + 64 y^4
bring all terms to left side:
64 y^6 - 48 y2 - 158.79 + 201.6144 y2 - 64 y^4 = 0
combine like terms:
64 y^6 -64 y^4 + (201.6144 - 48) y2 - 158.79 = 0
calculate:
64 y^6 -64 y^4 + 153.6144 y2 - 158.79 = 0
this is a cubic equation in y2.
let z = y2.
then:
64 z^3 -64 z^2 + 153.6144 z - 158.79 = 0
this is a cubic equation in z.
solving this cubic equation may be complicated, but perhaps we can approximate.
given that the kinetic energy is 3 gev, which is much smaller than the rest mass energies (198 gev and 99 gev).
so the velocities are non-relativistic, hence gamma is approximately 1.
therefore, the momenta would be approximately p ≈ gamma m v ≈ m v.
therefore, maybe we can approximate.
alternatively, since the total kinetic energy is 3 gev, compared to rest mass energies of 198 gev and 99 gev, which are much larger.
so the gamma factors are approximately 1 + t/(2 m c2 ) from the non-relativistic approximation of gamma ≈ 1 + (v2)/(2 c2 ) and p ≈ m v.
wait, let's check.
for the first fragment, t1 = (gamma1 - 1) m1 c2.
if gamma1 -1 is small, then t1 ≈ (gamma1 -1 ) * m1 c2.
similarly for t2.
given that t1 + t2 = 3 gev, which is small compared to m1 c2 =198 gev and m2 c2=99 gev, so we can approximate gamma1 -1 ≈ t1/(m1 c2 ) and gamma2 -1 ≈ t2/(m2 c2 ).
then, the total gamma correction is small.
but let's see.
but in the equation 2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 3 + 1/33 ≈ 3.0303.
if gamma1 ≈ 1 and gamma2 ≈ 1, then 2*1 +1=3, which is close.
the actual value is 3.0303, so gamma1 and gamma2 are slightly larger than 1.
therefore, we can linearize the equations.
let’s write gamma1 = 1 + epsilon1 and gamma2 = 1 + epsilon2.
then, 2(1 + epsilon1) + (1 + epsilon2) = 3.0303
which gives 2 + 2 epsilon1 +1 + epsilon2 = 3.0303 => 3 + 3 epsilon1 + epsilon2 = 3.0303 => 3 epsilon1 + epsilon2 ≈ 0.0303
also, since t1 = epsilon1 m1 c2 and t2 = epsilon2 m2 c2.
and t1 + t2 = 3 gev.
so, epsilon1 * m1 c2 + epsilon2 * m2 c2 = 3 gev.
substituting m1 c2 =198 gev, m2 c2=99 gev:
198 epsilon1 +99 epsilon2 =3.
divide by 99:
2 epsilon1 + epsilon2 = 3/99 =1/33 ≈ 0.0303.
so now we have two equations:
1) 3 epsilon1 + epsilon2 = 0.0303
2) 2 epsilon1 + epsilon2 = 0.0303
subtract equation 2 from equation 1:
(3 epsilon1 + epsilon2) - (2 epsilon1 + epsilon2) = 0.0303 - 0.0303
which gives epsilon1 =0.
wait, that can't be.
that would imply epsilon1=0, which would give epsilon2=0.0303.
but substituting back, that can't be.
wait, there must be a mistake here.
wait, in equation 2, if t1 + t2 =3 gev, and t1 = epsilon1 * 198 gev, t2=epsilon2 * 99 gev, then 198 epsilon1 +99 epsilon2 =3.
but 198= 2*99, so 2*99*epsilon1 +99 epsilon2=3 => 99*(18 epsilon1 + epsilon2)=3 => 18 epsilon1 + epsilon2=3/99=1/33≈0.0303.
wait, no.
wait, 198 epsilon1 +99 epsilon2=3.
divide both sides by 99: 2 epsilon1 + epsilon2=3/99=1/33≈0.0303.
okay, so equation 2 is 2 epsilon1 + epsilon2≈0.0303.
but from equation 1, derived from 2 gamma1 +gamma2=3.0303, which after linearization gives 3 epsilon1 + epsilon2=0.0303.
therefore, equations:
1) 3 epsilon1 + epsilon2=0.0303
2) 2 epsilon1 + epsilon2=0.0303
subtract equation 2 from equation 1:
(3 epsilon1 + epsilon2) - (2 epsilon1 + epsilon2)=0.0303 -0.0303
which gives epsilon1=0.
which would imply that epsilon2=0.0303.
but substituting back into equation 2: 2*0 + epsilon2=0.0303, which is consistent.
but epsilon1=0 implies that gamma1=1, which means t1=0.
but this contradicts the fact that t1 + t2=3 gev.
so if epsilon1=0, then t1=0, so t2=3 gev, which would imply that all the kinetic energy goes to the lighter fragment.
but this is inconsistent with momentum conservation.
wait, there must be a mistake in the approach.
wait, the problem is that when we linearize, we are assuming that epsilon1 and epsilon2 are small.
but if epsilon1=0, then epsilon2=0.0303, which is not negligible compared to the energy.
let's check how big that is.
the rest mass energy of the second fragment is 99 gev.
so, t2= epsilon2 * m2 c2=0.0303 *99 gev≈3 gev.
which is exactly the total energy released.
so, all the kinetic energy would go to the lighter fragment, which is unphysical.
because if all the kinetic energy is given to the lighter fragment, then its energy would be 3 gev, and the momentum would be high.
but the other fragment would have zero kinetic energy, so momentum would be zero.
which violates momentum conservation.
therefore, this approach is flawed.
therefore, the linearization is invalid.
therefore, we need a better approach.
so, since the total kinetic energy is 3 gev, and the rest mass energies are 198 gev and 99 gev, which are much larger, so the velocities are indeed non-relativistic, but not strictly non-relativistic.
so maybe we need a better approximation.
alternatively, let's compute the exact relativistic result.
given that p1 = p2 = p.
therefore, for each fragment:
e1 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m1 c2 )^2 )
e2 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m2 c2 )^2 )
the kinetic energies are t1 = e1 - m1 c2 and t2 = e2 - m2 c2.
and t1 + t2 = 3 gev.
so:
sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m1 c2 )^2 ) - m1 c2 + sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m2 c2 )^2 ) - m2 c2 = 3 gev
which can be written as:
sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m1 c2 )^2 ) + sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m2 c2 )^2 ) = 3 gev + m1 c2 + m2 c2
but m1 c2 + m2 c2 = 0.99 m c2 =0.99*300=297 gev.
therefore:
sqrt( (p c)^2 + 198^2 ) + sqrt( (p c)^2 + 99^2 ) = 3 + 297 = 300 gev
where all terms are in gev, and (p c) is in gev·cm/s (but units will work out with appropriate c factors).
let’s denote x = p c in gev·cm/s.
then:
sqrt( x2 + 1982 ) + sqrt( x2 + 992 ) = 300
we can solve for x.
let me set this up:
sqrt( x2 + (198)^2 ) + sqrt( x2 + (99)^2 ) = 300
let me divide both sides by c to get x in terms of gev s/cm.
wait, but actually, units might complicate.
alternatively, non-dimensionalize by dividing through 99 gev:
let’s let y = x / (99 gev).
then:
sqrt( (99 y)^2 +198^2 ) + sqrt( (99 y)^2 +99^2 ) =300
which simplifies:
sqrt( 99^2 y2 + 198^2 ) + sqrt( 99^2 y2 +99^2 )=300
factor out 99^2:
sqrt( 99^2 ( y2 + 4 )) + sqrt( 99^2 ( y2 +1 )) =300
which becomes:
99 sqrt( y2 +4 ) +99 sqrt( y2 +1 )=300
factor out 99:
99( sqrt( y2 +4 ) + sqrt( y2 +1 ) )=300
therefore:
sqrt( y2 +4 ) + sqrt( y2 +1 )=300/99≈3.0303
this is the same equation as before.
so we need to solve for y.
let me square both sides:
[ sqrt( y2 +4 ) + sqrt( y2 +1 ) ]^2 = (3.0303)^2
expanding:
(y2 +4) + (y2 +1 ) + 2 sqrt{(y2 +4)(y2 +1)} ≈9.183
simplify:
2 y2 +5 + 2 sqrt{(y2 +4)(y2 +1)} ≈9.183
therefore:
2 sqrt{(y2 +4)(y2 +1)} ≈9.183 -2 y2 -5 ≈4.183 -2 y2
now, let’s square both sides again:
4 (y2 +4)(y2 +1 ) ≈(4.183 -2 y2 )^2
left side:
4 (y^4 +5 y2 +4 )
right side:
(4.183)^2 -2*4.183*2 y2 +4 y^4
calculate:
left side:4 y^4 +20 y2 +16
right side:17.495 -16.732 y2 +4 y^4
bring all terms to left side:
4 y^4 +20 y2 +16 -17.495 +16.732 y2 -4 y^4 >= 0
simplify:
(4 y^4 -4 y^4 ) + (20 y2 +16.732 y2 ) + (16 -17.495 )=36.732 y2 -1.495=0
therefore:
36.732 y2 =1.495
thus:
y2≈1.495 /36.732≈0.0407
therefore:
y≈0.2017
recall that y=x/(99 gev), where x=p c.
therefore, x= y *99 gev=0.2017 *99 gev≈20 gev.
therefore, p c≈20 gev.
so the momentum p is approximately 20 gev/c.
now, compute the relativistic kinetic energy t1 for the more massive fragment.
t1 = (gamma1 -1) m1 c2.
first, compute gamma1:
gamma1 = sqrt(1 + (p^2 c2 )/( m12 c^4 )) = sqrt(1 + ( (p c )^2 )/( m12 c^4 ) *c^4 ? wait, let me be careful with units.
actually, the expression for gamma is:
gamma = sqrt(1 + (p^2 c^2)/(m^2 c^4 )) = sqrt(1 + (p^2)/(m^2 c^2 ))
but need to plug in proper units.
alternatively, in natural units where c=1, but here we have to manage units.
alternatively, since we have pc in gev cm/s (but actually, commonly pc is used in gev).
assuming c=1 in those units.
wait, in particle physics, it's common to use units where c=1, so masses are in gev/c2, and momentum in gev/c.
then, pc is in gev.
so if pc=20 gev, then (pc)^2=400 gev2.
the rest mass of fragment 1 is m1 c2=198 gev, so (m1 c2 )^2=198^2=39204 gev2.
then, the energy e1= sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m1 c2 )^2 )=sqrt(400 + 39204)=sqrt(39604)=199 gev.
therefore, kinetic energy t1 = e1 - m1 c2=199 -198=1 gev.
similarly for fragment 2:
e2= sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m2 c2 )^2 )=sqrt(400 + 99^2)=sqrt(400 +9801)=sqrt(10201)=101 gev.
thus, t2=e2 -m2 c2=101 -99=2 gev.
so total kinetic energy t1 + t2=1 +2=3 gev, which checks out.
therefore, the relativistic calculation gives t1=1 gev, same as the non-relativistic case.
wait, that can't be.
because we just did the relativistic calculation and found that t1=1 gev, which is the same as the non-relativistic result.
but this contradicts the expectation that relativistic effects would divide energy differently.
but in this case, even though the total kinetic energy is 3 gev, which is small compared to the rest mass energies (198 gev and 99 gev), the distribution of
