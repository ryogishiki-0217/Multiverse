Okay, let's see. The problem is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The given options are A) 6.3x10^-7 M, B) 2.0x10^-2 M, C) 1.0x10^-2 M, and D) 5.0x10^-3 M. The stability constant, K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. Hmm. Since it's a complexation reaction, I need to consider the formation constant, right?
Let's think in parallel.

The reaction is Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ CaEDTA²⁻, with a 1:1 stoichiometry for Ca²⁺ and EDTA. The formation constant Kf is [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][Y^4-]).
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Given that the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, which is stoichiometric. That means the complex is formed completely, but here they mention the pH is ideal, so maybe side reactions are negligible. At pH 10 or so, EDTA typically behaves as Y^4-, but since the temperature is 25°C, standard conditions. The problem gives the K for the Ca-EDTA complex as 5x10^10. That's a really large K, meaning the complex is very stable. So the reaction lies far to the right, but we need to find the concentration of free Ca2+ ions. Even though the complex is very stable, there's still a slight dissociation, which we need to calculate.
Let me write down the expression for the formation constant:
K = [CaEDTA2-] / ([Ca2+][Y4-])
But the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So [CaEDTA2-] = 0.02 M. Assuming that the concentrations of free Ca2+ and free Y4- are due to the dissociation of the complex. Since K is very large, the dissociation must be very small. Let's denote the concentration of Ca2+ and Y4- at equilibrium as x. So, if the complex dissociates to a small extent x, then [Ca2+] = x and [Y4-] = x. Therefore, K = [CaEDTA2-] / (x^2). Wait, so rearranged:
x^2 = [CaEDTA2-] / K
Then, x = sqrt([CaEDTA2-] / K)
Plugging in the numbers:
[CaEDTA2-] is 0.02 M, K is 5x10^10
So, x^2 = 0.02 / (5x10^10) = 0.02 / 5x10^10 = 0.004x10^-10 = 4x10^-13
Then, x = sqrt(4x10^-13) = 2x10^-6.5, but sqrt(10^-13) is 10^-6.5? Wait, 10^-13 is 10^(-2*6.5), so sqrt(10^-13) is 10^(-6.5). But 2x10^-6.5 would be 2*10^(-6.5) = 2*10^(-7 - 0.5) = 2*10^(-7)/sqrt(10) ≈ 2 / 3.16 ≈ 0.63, so 0.63x10^-6 ≈ 6.3x10^-7 M. Wait, but 10^-6.5 is 10^(-6 - 0.5) = 10^(-6)/sqrt(10) ≈ 10^(-6)/3.16 ≈ 3.16x10^-7. So 2x10^-6.5 ≈ 2 * 3.16x10^-7 ≈ 6.3x10^-7 M.
Wait, but let me check the calculation again. x^2 = 0.02 / (5e10) = (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4 * 1e-12 = 4e-13. So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 M. But 2e-6.5 is 2 * 10^(-6.5) M. 10^(-6.5) is 10^(-6 -0.5) = 10^(-6)/sqrt(10). sqrt(10) ≈ 3.1623, so 10^(-6)/3.1623 ≈ 3.1623e-7. Therefore, 2 * 3.1623e-7 ≈ 6.325e-7 M. So approximately 6.3e-7 M. Therefore, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3x10^-7 M. So that's answer option A. But let me make sure. Let's think in parallel.

Given that the solution contains 0.02 M of the complex. Assuming the complex is formed completely from Ca2+ and EDTA, but in reality, a tiny amount dissociates into Ca2+ and Y4-. Let me check if my assumption that [CaEDTA2-] ≈ 0.02 M is valid. Since K is 5e10, the reaction strongly favors the complex, so the dissociation is negligible, hence [CaEDTA2-] ≈ 0.02 M, and [Ca2+] = [Y4-] = x. Thus, K = 0.02 / x2. Therefore, solving for x gives x = sqrt(0.02 / 5e10) = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 ≈ 6.3e-7 M. So this x is indeed negligible compared to 0.02 M, so the approximation is valid. Therefore, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3e-7 M, which is option A. Therefore, the answer should be A. I think that's right. Let me just think again. Alternatively, is there another way someone might approach this? Maybe considering the initial concentration of Ca2+ and EDTA? Wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So that means initially, there was 0.02 M Ca2+ and 0.02 M EDTA, which reacted to form 0.02 M complex. But if the K is 5e10, then the reaction is practically complete, but there's a very small dissociation. So starting from 0.02 M complex, it dissociates slightly into Ca2+ and EDTA. So the concentration of Ca2+ is equal to the square root of (0.02 / 5e10). Which is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 ≈ 6.3e-7. Yes, that makes sense. If the problem was about a solution with 0.02 M Ca2+ and excess EDTA, then we might calculate the concentration of the complex, but here it's given the concentration of the complex, and we need to find the concentration of free Ca2+. Therefore, answer A. The final answer is \boxed{A}

given that the solution contains 0.02 m of the ca-edta complex, which is stoichiometric. that means the complex is formed completely, but here they mention the ph is ideal, so maybe side reactions are negligible. at ph 10 or so, edta typically behaves as y^4-, but since the temperature is 25°c, standard conditions. the problem gives the k for the ca-edta complex as 5x10^10. that's a really large k, meaning the complex is very stable. so the reaction lies far to the right, but we need to find the concentration of free ca2+ ions. even though the complex is very stable, there's still a slight dissociation, which we need to calculate.
let me write down the expression for the formation constant:
k = [caedta2-] / ([ca2+][y4-])
but the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 m ca-edta complex. so [caedta2-] = 0.02 m. assuming that the concentrations of free ca2+ and free y4- are due to the dissociation of the complex. since k is very large, the dissociation must be very small. let's denote the concentration of ca2+ and y4- at equilibrium as x. so, if the complex dissociates to a small extent x, then [ca2+] = x and [y4-] = x. therefore, k = [caedta2-] / (x^2). wait, so rearranged:
x^2 = [caedta2-] / k
then, x = sqrt([caedta2-] / k)
plugging in the numbers:
[caedta2-] is 0.02 m, k is 5x10^10
so, x^2 = 0.02 / (5x10^10) = 0.02 / 5x10^10 = 0.004x10^-10 = 4x10^-13
then, x = sqrt(4x10^-13) = 2x10^-6.5, but sqrt(10^-13) is 10^-6.5? wait, 10^-13 is 10^(-2*6.5), so sqrt(10^-13) is 10^(-6.5). but 2x10^-6.5 would be 2*10^(-6.5) = 2*10^(-7 - 0.5) = 2*10^(-7)/sqrt(10) ≈ 2 / 3.16 ≈ 0.63, so 0.63x10^-6 ≈ 6.3x10^-7 m. wait, but 10^-6.5 is 10^(-6 - 0.5) = 10^(-6)/sqrt(10) ≈ 10^(-6)/3.16 ≈ 3.16x10^-7. so 2x10^-6.5 ≈ 2 * 3.16x10^-7 ≈ 6.3x10^-7 m.
wait, but let me check the calculation again. x^2 = 0.02 / (5e10) = (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4 * 1e-12 = 4e-13. so x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 m. but 2e-6.5 is 2 * 10^(-6.5) m. 10^(-6.5) is 10^(-6 -0.5) = 10^(-6)/sqrt(10). sqrt(10) ≈ 3.1623, so 10^(-6)/3.1623 ≈ 3.1623e-7. therefore, 2 * 3.1623e-7 ≈ 6.325e-7 m. so approximately 6.3e-7 m. therefore, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3x10^-7 m. so that's answer option a. but let me make sure. let's think in parallel.
