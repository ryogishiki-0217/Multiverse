Okay, so I need to figure out which of these molecules has C3h symmetry.
Let me start by recalling what C3h symmetry means.
C3h is a point group that includes a three-fold rotational axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh).
So, the molecule should have rotational symmetry of order 3 and also be planar or have a horizontal mirror plane.
Hmm.
Let me go through each option one by one.
First, triisopropyl borate.
The structure of triisopropyl borate is B(OC(CH3)2)3.
Each isopropoxy group is attached to the boron atom.
The isopropoxy groups are bulky and likely arranged in a trigonal planar geometry around the boron.
If the three isopropoxy groups are arranged symmetrically, maybe in a plane with a C3 axis, then the molecule could have C3h symmetry.
Let me visualize that.
Each isopropoxy group has a CH3 CH(OB) group.
Since all three are identical, the arrangement around boron would be symmetrical.
Trigonal planar geometry would imply a horizontal mirror plane.
But wait, if the three groups are in a plane, then reflecting across that plane would superimpose the molecule onto itself, and rotating by 120 degrees would also keep it looking the same.
So that does sound like C3h symmetry.
But wait, wait.
Trigonal planar is D3h symmetry, right?
Because it has a horizontal plane and three mirror planes.
But if the substituents are all the same, maybe the mirror planes are not present.
Wait, no.
For a trigonal planar molecule like BF3, which is symmetrical, it has D3h symmetry.
But if the ligands are not identical, the symmetry is reduced.
But in triisopropyl borate, all three ligands are identical isopropoxy groups.
So, the symmetry should be D3h, which includes a C3 axis, three mirror planes (σv), and a horizontal mirror plane (σh).
But the problem is asking for C3h symmetry, which is a lower symmetry.
So maybe triisopropyl borate isn't C3h?
Hmm.
Alternatively, maybe the isopropyl groups are arranged in a way that breaks some symmetry.
For example, if the isopropoxy groups are not planar.
But wait, in a borate with three substituents, the geometry is trigonal planar, which is in a plane.
So, the three groups are in a plane, so the molecule is planar.
Then, the symmetry elements would be C3 and σh, making it C3h.
Wait, but I thought that if there are also vertical mirror planes, it's D3h.
But wait, maybe if the substituents are not symmetrical, the vertical mirror planes are not present.
Wait, but if all three substituents are identical, then the vertical mirror planes should be present.
So, the symmetry would be D3h.
So triisopropyl borate would have D3h symmetry, not C3h.
Therefore, option A might not be the correct answer.
Hmm.
This is confusing.
Let me check what C3h actually is.
C3h point group: molecules that have a three-fold rotational axis and a horizontal mirror plane.
Additionally, this would include inversion symmetry.
But does it have vertical mirror planes?
No, because in the C3h point group, there are no vertical mirror planes.
So, for a molecule to have C3h symmetry, it must have a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane, but not the vertical mirror planes that D3h has.
So, if all the substituents are identical and arranged in a triangle in a plane, but without vertical mirror planes, how is that possible?
Wait, perhaps if the substituents are not identical.
For example, if two substituents are the same and one is different.
Wait, but triisopropyl borate has three identical substituents.
Then, perhaps it does have vertical mirror planes, hence D3h.
Therefore, the answer cannot be A.
Moving on to option B: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.
This name is really complex.
Let me try to parse it.
Triphenyleno is a fused ring system, I think.
Triphenylene is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with three benzene rings.
Then it's fused with trifuran, which are three furan rings.
And then it's a hexaone, meaning six ketone groups.
The numbering is complicated.
Given the complexity, it's probably a macrocycle or a larger annular system.
Maybe with a three-fold symmetry.
If the molecule has threefold symmetry in its framework, like a triangular shape, then it could have C3h symmetry if it's planar.
But given that it's a polycyclic system with multiple fused rings, it might not be flat.
Alternatively, maybe the overall structure has a C3 axis but no vertical mirror planes.
Hmm.
But without a specific structure to look at, it's hard to say.
Let's move on and come back.
Option C: quinuclidine.
Quinuclidine is an amine with the formula (CH2)2N(C6H11).
Wait, no, quinuclidine is a cyclic amine.
Its structure is a bicyclic system: it has a six-membered ring fused to a five-membered amine ring.
Specifically, it's a tricyclic amine?
Wait, actually, quinuclidine is derived from quinoline.
No, wait, quinuclidine is a bicyclic tertiary amine.
The structure is a six-membered ring (like cyclohexane) with a five-membered amine ring fused on two adjacent carbons, forming a bridge.
The exact structure is a bridge between carbons 1 and 2 of cyclohexane, creating a five-membered ring with the bridge.
The nitrogen is in the five-membered ring.
So, the structure is a bridgehead amine.
The key point is that quinuclidine has a saturated structure with a bridge.
The symmetry here: the molecule is not planar because it's a fused bicyclic system.
The main symmetry element might be a C2 axis if it's bisected, but depending on the fusion.
But quinuclidine's structure is more like a chair conformation.
Wait, actually, the most stable conformation of quinuclidine is a chair-like structure with the bridge being in a pseudo-axial position.
The molecule doesn't have high symmetry.
Maybe it has a C2 axis if the two sides are symmetrical.
But I don't think it has C3h symmetry.
It's probably lower, maybe C1 or maybe Cs if it has a plane of symmetry.
Not sure.
Let me check.
Quinuclidine's structure is a bicyclic system where the nitrogen is in the bridgehead.
The molecule is chiral, so it doesn't have any symmetry plane or center.
Therefore, its symmetry is lower, maybe just C1.
So, probably not C3h.
So option C is unlikely.
Option D: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.
Again, a very complex name.
Benzo fused with trifuran, and hexaone.
So, similar to option B, but this one starts with benzo, which is a benzene ring fused to three furan rings (trifuran), and then has six ketone groups.
The numbering suggests positions 1,3,4,6,7,9.
Again, this is likely a macrocyclic system or a highly fused polycyclic system.
If it's built around a central triangle of three fused furan rings, each with a benzene ring fused to them, then maybe the overall structure has a threefold symmetry.
If the molecule is planar and has rotational symmetry of order 3, but no vertical mirror planes, then it could have C3h symmetry.
Alternatively, if the benzene rings are fused in such a way that they create a symmetric structure with threefold rotational symmetry and a horizontal mirror plane, then that would be C3h.
Comparing options B and D: both are complex polycyclic systems with "trifuran" in their names.
The difference is option B has triphenyleno (which is three benzene rings) fused to trifuran, while option D has benzo fused to trifuran.
Triphenylene itself is three benzene rings fused in a cyclic arrangement, whereas benzo is a single benzene ring.
So, in option D, a benzene ring is fused to the trifuran (three furan rings).
If the three furan rings are arranged symmetrically around a central axis, and the benzene ring is fused to one of them, maybe the overall molecule still has threefold rotational symmetry.
But adding a benzene ring to one furan might break the symmetry.
Alternatively, maybe the fusing is such that the benzene ring is at one of the three positions, but the other two positions have substituents that maintain symmetry.
This is getting a bit too complicated without structural formulas.
Let's compare options B and D again.
The correct answer is the molecule with C3h symmetry, which requires a threefold axis and a horizontal mirror plane.
So, the molecule must be planar or have a horizontal mirror plane, and rotational symmetry of order three.
If we think about option A, triisopropyl borate: if it's trigonal planar, then it would have a horizontal mirror plane and three C2 axes perpendicular to the principal axis.
But trigonal planar with identical substituents would have D3h symmetry, which includes vertical mirror planes.
So unless the substituents are causing the vertical mirror planes to be absent, the symmetry would be D3h.
But how can that happen?
If the substituents are not identical?
But in triisopropyl borate, all substituents are the same, so vertical mirror planes should be present.
Therefore, A is not C3h.
Then, moving to quinuclidine (option C).
It's a bridged bicyclic amine.
The structure is 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octine or something similar.
The most stable conformation is like a chair.
In that case, the molecule has a C2 axis if the two sides of the bridge are symmetrical.
However, due to the bridge and the nitrogen, the molecule might not have a mirror plane.
If it's asymmetrical, then the symmetry could be C2 or even lower.
But quinuclidine's actual structure is more complex.
Let me recall: quinuclidine is a tricyclic amine?
No, it's bicyclic.
The structure consists of a six-membered ring with a bridge connecting two adjacent carbons, creating a five-membered ring that includes a nitrogen.
The six-membered ring would adopt a chair conformation, with the bridgehead being one of the carbons.
The five-membered ring (including the nitrogen) would be in a boat or envelope conformation.
In any case, such a structure typically lacks symmetry elements beyond perhaps a C2 axis if the substituents around the bridge are the same.
However, because of the nitrogen and the bridge, the molecule is chiral (has two enantiomers), which suggests that the symmetry is low, maybe only a C2 axis if the molecule is symmetrical around the bridge.
But even that might not be the case because of the different environments on either side of the bridge.
So, quinuclidine is likely not C3h.
Then options B and D are left.
Both are complex organic compounds with multiple rings.
The key is to determine which one has the required symmetry.
Let me think about the names again.
Option D: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.
The "benzo" part indicates a benzene ring fused to the trifuran at specific positions.
Trifuran is three furan rings connected in a row?
Or perhaps in a triangular fashion?
The positions given in the fusion (1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'') suggest that each benzo is fused to a different part of the trifuran.
Alternatively, "trifuran" might be a system of three furan rings arranged in a triangle, each fused to the next.
If that's the case, then benzo fused to trifuran might be substituting one of the furan rings with a benzene ring.
But the numbering here is critical.
However, without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging.
Alternatively, the "hexaone" part indicates six ketone groups.
The positions are 1,3,4,6,7,9.
If these positions are arranged symmetrically in the molecule, that might imply threefold symmetry.
For example, if the molecule has three identical branches each with two ketone groups.
But this is speculative.
Similarly, option B: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.
Triphenyleno is a three-benzene ring system fused to trifuran at multiple positions, creating another complex structure with six ketone groups.
The term "triphenyleno" refers to a specific fused tricyclic system where three benzene rings are connected in a way that each is sharing adjacent sides, forming a larger aromatic system.
When fused to trifuran (three furan rings), this could create a structure with both benzene and furan rings arranged in a symmetric way.
If the resulting molecule has threefold rotational symmetry and a horizontal mirror plane, then it would be C3h.
Alternatively, the arrangement might be such that it has a higher symmetry like D3h.
The key difference between C3h and D3h is the presence of vertical mirror planes in D3h.
If those vertical mirror planes are absent, then the molecule would belong to C3h.
How can vertical mirror planes be absent?
If there are asymmetric substituents that prevent the mirror planes from being present.
For example, if the hexaone groups (ketone substituents) are placed in a way that breaks the vertical mirror planes but maintains the horizontal mirror plane and the threefold rotational axis.
Alternatively, let's compare options B and D again.
Option B: triphenyleno...trifuran...hexaone.
Triphenylene is a tricyclic system with three benzene rings.
Trifuran is three furan rings.
So, this molecule seems to be a fusion of triphenylene and trifuran, creating a large annular system.
If triphenylene (three benzene rings) is fused with trifuran (three furan rings) in a symmetric fashion, the resultant molecule might have D3 symmetry.
However, adding hexaone groups (six ketones) could break some symmetry.
However, if the ketone groups are placed symmetrically, the molecule could retain C3h symmetry.
Similarly, option D is benzo fused to trifuran, but perhaps in a way that has threefold symmetry.
But since it's only one benzo ring fused to trifuran, maybe the symmetry is lower.
Alternatively, considering the numbering on option D: positions 1,3,4,6,7,9.
If the molecule has threefold symmetry, these positions might correspond to symmetrically equivalent positions.
For example, positions 1, 4, 7 might be one set and 3,6,9 another, but arranged in a rotational manner.
Alternatively, the positions could be arranged such that the molecule has three ketone groups at 120-degree angles and another three.
But without the exact structure, it's hard to say.
However, between the two options, B is triphenyleno-trifuran, which suggests a larger, more symmetric fused system.
Triphenylene itself has a high degree of symmetry.
When fused with trifuran in a symmetric manner, and with hexaone groups placed symmetrically, the molecule could have C3h symmetry.
Alternatively, let's consider the other options again.
If option A is D3h, not C3h, and option C has lower symmetry, then options B or D.
But which one?
Alternatively, maybe option D is the correct answer.
Wait, let's think about the names again.
Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran... implies that the benzo ring is fused to the trifuran at three different positions (1,2; 3,4; 5,6), which suggests a symmetric fusion.
If trifuran is a triangular arrangement of three furan rings, and a benzene ring is fused symmetrically to each of the three furan rings, then the overall structure might have a threefold axis.
However, attaching a benzene ring to each of the three furan rings would make it similar to a triphenylene structure.
But in this case, it's benzo fused to trifuran.
So, perhaps option D's structure is similar to triphenylene but with furan rings instead.
But then how is option B different?
Option B is triphenyleno fused to trifuran.
So triphenylene (three benzene rings) fused to trifuran (three furan rings).
That would create a larger polycyclic system with both benzene and furan rings.
If this is arranged in a symmetric way, like a triangular triphenylene unit fused to a triangular trifuran unit, the entire molecule could have C3h symmetry if it's planar with a horizontal mirror plane.
However, if the benzene and furan rings are fused in a way that causes the molecule to deviate from planarity, the mirror plane may be lost.
But the presence of ketone groups (hexaone) might affect the symmetry.
If the ketone groups are placed symmetrically, they might not disrupt the horizontal mirror plane and rotational symmetry.
Alternatively, let's recall that in point group determination, for a molecule to have C3h symmetry, it must have a principal C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane, but not the vertical mirror planes that D3h has.
So, how can a molecule with identical substituents have C3h and not D3h?
It's possible if the molecule is not superimposed on itself by vertical mirror planes.
For example, consider a trigonal planar molecule with three identical substituents that are asymmetric.
Each substituent is asymmetric, so reflecting through a vertical plane would not superimpose the molecule onto itself.
However, rotating by 120 degrees would still match.
So, in such a case, the molecule would have C3h symmetry.
Going back to triisopropyl borate (option A).
The isopropoxy group is -O-C(CH3)2.
Each isopropoxy group is symmetric about the oxygen, but the two methyl groups are attached to the central carbon.
If the boron is trigonal planar, each isopropoxy group is in a plane with the boron.
However, the arrangement of the three groups around the boron: if the groups are identical and the molecule is flat, then the vertical mirror planes would be present, leading to D3h symmetry.
But if the groups are arranged in a way that they are not superimposable with their mirror images, then vertical mirror planes are not present.
However, in reality, triisopropyl borate's structure is likely that the three isopropoxy groups are arranged symmetrically in a plane, leading to D3h symmetry.
So, unless there is some twist or asymmetry in the groups, which is unlikely for a planar molecule, the vertical mirror planes would be present.
Therefore, option A is not the correct answer.
So, the correct answer must be one of the other options.
Between B and D.
Considering that both are complex organic molecules with multiple rings, but option B is triphenyleno fused to trifuran, which suggests a symmetric structure.
Triphenylene itself has D3h symmetry.
If fused symmetrically to trifuran, and with hexaone groups placed in a symmetric fashion, the molecule could retain D3h or lower symmetry.
But if the fusion or the substituents break some symmetry, maybe it lowers to C3h.
On the other hand, option D is benzo fused to trifuran.
If this creates a structure with threefold rotational symmetry but no vertical mirror planes, then it could be C3h.
For example, if the benzo ring is fused to one furan in the trifuran, and the other two furans have substituents that make the molecule asymmetrical with respect to the vertical planes.
Alternatively, the numbering of the hexaone groups in option D (positions 1,3,4,6,7,9) might be symmetrically arranged.
If the molecule has threefold symmetry, these positions could repeat every three positions.
For example, positions 1,4,7 and 3,6,9.
If the molecule has six positions for the ketones, arranged in two sets of three, this might imply a threefold symmetry.
But again, without the exact structure, it's challenging.
However, considering that triphenylene (as in option B) is a symmetrical system of three benzene rings, when fused to trifuran (three furan rings), it's possible that the molecule retains a high degree of symmetry.
If the hexaone groups are placed in a way that breaks the vertical mirror planes but keeps the horizontal mirror plane and C3 axis, then the symmetry would be C3h.
Alternatively, if the benzene and furan rings are arranged in a way that the entire molecule is planar, then the horizontal mirror plane is present.
If there are three identical substituents around a central axis, and each substituent is asymmetrical, then vertical mirror planes would not be present.
For example, in option B, the triphenyleno part is three benzene rings.
Fusing each of them to a furan ring (trifuran) might result in each benzene being connected to a furan.
If the fusing is done in a way that each benzene is connected to a furan, forming a symmetric structure, but the hexaone groups (ketones) are placed in a way that breaks the vertical mirror planes, then the molecule would have C3h symmetry.
Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B.
But why?
Let me check the names again.
The correct answer needs to have C3h symmetry.
Which of these molecules could have that?
If triisopropyl borate is D3h, then not A.
Quinuclidine is likely C1, so not C.
That leaves B and D.
Benzo...trifuran...hexaone (option D) versus triphenyleno...trifuran...hexaone (option B).
The key difference is that option B starts with triphenyleno, which is three benzene rings fused in a specific way, while option D starts with benzo, which is one benzene ring.
So, option B is three benzene rings fused to three furan rings (trifuran).
This could create a large, potentially symmetric, annular system.
If the three benzene rings are arranged in a triangle (as in triphenylene) and each is connected to a furan ring, which are in turn connected, forming a trifuran, then the overall structure might have a triangular shape.
If this is all planar, then it has a horizontal mirror plane.
If there's a threefold rotational axis, then that's another symmetry element.
However, if the molecule also has vertical mirror planes, it would be D3h.
To have C3h, it must lack vertical mirror planes.
How?
For example, if the hexaone groups (ketones) are placed in a way that each vertical mirror plane is disrupted.
If the ketone groups are placed asymmetrically with respect to the vertical planes but symmetrically with respect to the threefold axis, then vertical mirror planes would be absent.
However, without knowing the exact positions, it's hard to say.
But considering the numbering in option B: hexaone at positions 1,3,6,8,11,13.
If the molecule has threefold symmetry, these positions might be arranged such that each set of two ketones is repeated every three positions.
Alternatively, if the molecule has a repeating unit every three positions, then this could correspond to threefold symmetry.
Similarly, in option D, the hexaone positions are 1,3,4,6,7,9.
This might not show a clear threefold symmetry.
Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.
Wait, let's think about the structures again.
Triphenylene is a molecule composed of three benzene rings connected in a cycle.
The structure is like a benzannulated benzene, forming a hexagonal shape with three benzene rings.
When triphenylene is fused to trifuran (three furan rings), creating option B, the resulting molecule might have a similar hexagonal shape but with furan rings replacing some benzenes.
However, the exact fusion points are given by the numbering in the name.
The name triphenyleno[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran... suggests that each benzene ring in the triphenylene is connected to a furan ring in the trifuran.
The numbering implies that the fusion occurs at multiple points.
If the result is a planar molecule with threefold rotational symmetry but no vertical mirror planes due to the arrangement of the hexaone groups, then it would have C3h symmetry.
On the other hand, option D is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran..., which suggests that a single benzene ring is fused to the trifuran at three different positions.
This could result in a Y-shaped molecule or some other structure, but it's not immediately clear.
Given that the question is multiple choice, and considering that triphenylene is a symmetrical structure, option B is more likely to have the required symmetry.
However, the presence of hexaone groups (six ketone groups) might disrupt symmetry.
But if they are placed symmetrically, the molecule could retain C3h.
For example, if each of the three furan rings in the trifuran has two ketone groups placed in a way that is symmetric with respect to the threefold axis but not to the vertical planes, then the molecule would have C3h symmetry.
Alternatively, if the hexaone groups are placed at positions that are equivalent under C3 rotation but not under vertical mirrors, then the symmetry is C3h.
The positions given in option B are 1,3,6,8,11,13.
If the molecule has positions numbered such that these six positions are equivalent under rotation by 120 degrees, then that would imply threefold rotational symmetry.
However, without the exact structure, it's difficult to be certain.
Alternatively, the correct answer is option B.
But why?
Let me check the other options again.
Option D: benzo...trifuran..., which is a single benzene fused to trifuran.
This is less likely to have threefold symmetry than option B, which is triphenyleno fused to trifuran.
Therefore, option B is more likely to have the required C3h symmetry.
Therefore, the answer should be B.
**Final Answer** 
\boxed{B}
</Think>

Answer: To determine which molecule has C3h symmetry, we need to consider the molecular structure and symmetry elements. C3h symmetry includes a three-fold rotational axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh).

1. **Triisopropyl Borate (Option A)**:
   - Structure: B(OC(CH3)2)3 with three isopropoxy groups attached trigonal planar around boron.
   - Symmetry: If planar, it would have D3h symmetry (C3 axis and vertical mirror planes). However, if the substituents are asymmetrical, it could reduce to C3h. But identical substituents likely maintain D3h symmetry, so not C3h.

2. **Quinuclidine (Option C)**:
   - Structure: Bridged bicyclic amine with a six-membered and a five-membered ring.
   - Symmetry: Chiral with low symmetry (likely C1), not C3h.

3. **Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (Option D)**:
   - Structure: Benzene fused to three furan rings with six ketone groups.
   - Symmetry: Complex structure, but likely lower symmetry due to single benzene fusion and ketone placement, not clear C3h symmetry.

4. **Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone (Option B)**:
   - Structure: Three benzene rings (triphenylene) fused to three furan rings with six ketone groups.
   - Symmetry: Triphenylene core provides potential three-fold symmetry. If fused planar with trifuran and ketone groups placed symmetrically around the C3 axis but asymmetrical in vertical planes, it results in C3h symmetry. The positions of the ketone groups (1,3,6,8,11,13) suggest symmetry compatible with C3h.

After evaluating all options, the molecule with C3h symmetry is:

\boxed{B}

<think>
okay, so i need to figure out which of these molecules has c3h symmetry.
let me start by recalling what c3h symmetry means.
c3h is a point group that includes a three-fold rotational axis (c3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh).
so, the molecule should have rotational symmetry of order 3 and also be planar or have a horizontal mirror plane.
hmm.
let me go through each option one by one.
first, triisopropyl borate.
the structure of triisopropyl borate is b(oc(ch3)2)3.
each isopropoxy group is attached to the boron atom.
the isopropoxy groups are bulky and likely arranged in a trigonal planar geometry around the boron.
if the three isopropoxy groups are arranged symmetrically, maybe in a plane with a c3 axis, then the molecule could have c3h symmetry.
let me visualize that.
each isopropoxy group has a ch3 ch(ob) group.
since all three are identical, the arrangement around boron would be symmetrical.
trigonal planar geometry would imply a horizontal mirror plane.
but wait, if the three groups are in a plane, then reflecting across that plane would superimpose the molecule onto itself, and rotating by 120 degrees would also keep it looking the same.
so that does sound like c3h symmetry.
but wait, wait.
trigonal planar is d3h symmetry, right?
because it has a horizontal plane and three mirror planes.
but if the substituents are all the same, maybe the mirror planes are not present.
wait, no.
for a trigonal planar molecule like bf3, which is symmetrical, it has d3h symmetry.
but if the ligands are not identical, the symmetry is reduced.
but in triisopropyl borate, all three ligands are identical isopropoxy groups.
so, the symmetry should be d3h, which includes a c3 axis, three mirror planes (σv), and a horizontal mirror plane (σh).
but the problem is asking for c3h symmetry, which is a lower symmetry.
so maybe triisopropyl borate isn't c3h?
hmm.
alternatively, maybe the isopropyl groups are arranged in a way that breaks some symmetry.
for example, if the isopropoxy groups are not planar.
but wait, in a borate with three substituents, the geometry is trigonal planar, which is in a plane.
so, the three groups are in a plane, so the molecule is planar.
then, the symmetry elements would be c3 and σh, making it c3h.
wait, but i thought that if there are also vertical mirror planes, it's d3h.
but wait, maybe if the substituents are not symmetrical, the vertical mirror planes are not present.
wait, but if all three substituents are identical, then the vertical mirror planes should be present.
so, the symmetry would be d3h.
so triisopropyl borate would have d3h symmetry, not c3h.
therefore, option a might not be the correct answer.
hmm.
this is confusing.
let me check what c3h actually is.
c3h point group: molecules that have a three-fold rotational axis and a horizontal mirror plane.
additionally, this would include inversion symmetry.
but does it have vertical mirror planes?
no, because in the c3h point group, there are no vertical mirror planes.
so, for a molecule to have c3h symmetry, it must have a c3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane, but not the vertical mirror planes that d3h has.
so, if all the substituents are identical and arranged in a triangle in a plane, but without vertical mirror planes, how is that possible?
wait, perhaps if the substituents are not identical.
for example, if two substituents are the same and one is different.
wait, but triisopropyl borate has three identical substituents.
then, perhaps it does have vertical mirror planes, hence d3h.
therefore, the answer cannot be a.
moving on to option b: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.
this name is really complex.
let me try to parse it.
triphenyleno is a fused ring system, i think.
triphenylene is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with three benzene rings.
then it's fused with trifuran, which are three furan rings.
and then it's a hexaone, meaning six ketone groups.
the numbering is complicated.
given the complexity, it's probably a macrocycle or a larger annular system.
maybe with a three-fold symmetry.
if the molecule has threefold symmetry in its framework, like a triangular shape, then it could have c3h symmetry if it's planar.
but given that it's a polycyclic system with multiple fused rings, it might not be flat.
alternatively, maybe the overall structure has a c3 axis but no vertical mirror planes.
hmm.
but without a specific structure to look at, it's hard to say.
let's move on and come back.
option c: quinuclidine.
quinuclidine is an amine with the formula (ch2)2n(c6h11).
wait, no, quinuclidine is a cyclic amine.
its structure is a bicyclic system: it has a six-membered ring fused to a five-membered amine ring.
specifically, it's a tricyclic amine?
wait, actually, quinuclidine is derived from quinoline.
no, wait, quinuclidine is a bicyclic tertiary amine.
the structure is a six-membered ring (like cyclohexane) with a five-membered amine ring fused on two adjacent carbons, forming a bridge.
the exact structure is a bridge between carbons 1 and 2 of cyclohexane, creating a five-membered ring with the bridge.
the nitrogen is in the five-membered ring.
so, the structure is a bridgehead amine.
the key point is that quinuclidine has a saturated structure with a bridge.
the symmetry here: the molecule is not planar because it's a fused bicyclic system.
the main symmetry element might be a c2 axis if it's bisected, but depending on the fusion.
but quinuclidine's structure is more like a chair conformation.
wait, actually, the most stable conformation of quinuclidine is a chair-like structure with the bridge being in a pseudo-axial position.
the molecule doesn't have high symmetry.
maybe it has a c2 axis if the two sides are symmetrical.
but i don't think it has c3h symmetry.
it's probably lower, maybe c1 or maybe cs if it has a plane of symmetry.
not sure.
let me check.
quinuclidine's structure is a bicyclic system where the nitrogen is in the bridgehead.
the molecule is chiral, so it doesn't have any symmetry plane or center.
therefore, its symmetry is lower, maybe just c1.
so, probably not c3h.
so option c is unlikely.
option d: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.
again, a very complex name.
benzo fused with trifuran, and hexaone.
so, similar to option b, but this one starts with benzo, which is a benzene ring fused to three furan rings (trifuran), and then has six ketone groups.
the numbering suggests positions 1,3,4,6,7,9.
again, this is likely a macrocyclic system or a highly fused polycyclic system.
if it's built around a central triangle of three fused furan rings, each with a benzene ring fused to them, then maybe the overall structure has a threefold symmetry.
if the molecule is planar and has rotational symmetry of order 3, but no vertical mirror planes, then it could have c3h symmetry.
alternatively, if the benzene rings are fused in such a way that they create a symmetric structure with threefold rotational symmetry and a horizontal mirror plane, then that would be c3h.
comparing options b and d: both are complex polycyclic systems with "trifuran" in their names.
the difference is option b has triphenyleno (which is three benzene rings) fused to trifuran, while option d has benzo fused to trifuran.
triphenylene itself is three benzene rings fused in a cyclic arrangement, whereas benzo is a single benzene ring.
so, in option d, a benzene ring is fused to the trifuran (three furan rings).
if the three furan rings are arranged symmetrically around a central axis, and the benzene ring is fused to one of them, maybe the overall molecule still has threefold rotational symmetry.
but adding a benzene ring to one furan might break the symmetry.
alternatively, maybe the fusing is such that the benzene ring is at one of the three positions, but the other two positions have substituents that maintain symmetry.
this is getting a bit too complicated without structural formulas.
let's compare options b and d again.
the correct answer is the molecule with c3h symmetry, which requires a threefold axis and a horizontal mirror plane.
so, the molecule must be planar or have a horizontal mirror plane, and rotational symmetry of order three.
if we think about option a, triisopropyl borate: if it's trigonal planar, then it would have a horizontal mirror plane and three c2 axes perpendicular to the principal axis.
but trigonal planar with identical substituents would have d3h symmetry, which includes vertical mirror planes.
so unless the substituents are causing the vertical mirror planes to be absent, the symmetry would be d3h.
but how can that happen?
if the substituents are not identical?
but in triisopropyl borate, all substituents are the same, so vertical mirror planes should be present.
therefore, a is not c3h.
then, moving to quinuclidine (option c).
it's a bridged bicyclic amine.
the structure is 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octine or something similar.
the most stable conformation is like a chair.
in that case, the molecule has a c2 axis if the two sides of the bridge are symmetrical.
however, due to the bridge and the nitrogen, the molecule might not have a mirror plane.
if it's asymmetrical, then the symmetry could be c2 or even lower.
but quinuclidine's actual structure is more complex.
let me recall: quinuclidine is a tricyclic amine?
no, it's bicyclic.
the structure consists of a six-membered ring with a bridge connecting two adjacent carbons, creating a five-membered ring that includes a nitrogen.
the six-membered ring would adopt a chair conformation, with the bridgehead being one of the carbons.
the five-membered ring (including the nitrogen) would be in a boat or envelope conformation.
in any case, such a structure typically lacks symmetry elements beyond perhaps a c2 axis if the substituents around the bridge are the same.
however, because of the nitrogen and the bridge, the molecule is chiral (has two enantiomers), which suggests that the symmetry is low, maybe only a c2 axis if the molecule is symmetrical around the bridge.
but even that might not be the case because of the different environments on either side of the bridge.
so, quinuclidine is likely not c3h.
then options b and d are left.
both are complex organic compounds with multiple rings.
the key is to determine which one has the required symmetry.
let me think about the names again.
option d: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.
the "benzo" part indicates a benzene ring fused to the trifuran at specific positions.
trifuran is three furan rings connected in a row?
or perhaps in a triangular fashion?
the positions given in the fusion (1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'') suggest that each benzo is fused to a different part of the trifuran.
alternatively, "trifuran" might be a system of three furan rings arranged in a triangle, each fused to the next.
if that's the case, then benzo fused to trifuran might be substituting one of the furan rings with a benzene ring.
but the numbering here is critical.
however, without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging.
alternatively, the "hexaone" part indicates six ketone groups.
the positions are 1,3,4,6,7,9.
if these positions are arranged symmetrically in the molecule, that might imply threefold symmetry.
for example, if the molecule has three identical branches each with two ketone groups.
but this is speculative.
similarly, option b: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.
triphenyleno is a three-benzene ring system fused to trifuran at multiple positions, creating another complex structure with six ketone groups.
the term "triphenyleno" refers to a specific fused tricyclic system where three benzene rings are connected in a way that each is sharing adjacent sides, forming a larger aromatic system.
when fused to trifuran (three furan rings), this could create a structure with both benzene and furan rings arranged in a symmetric way.
if the resulting molecule has threefold rotational symmetry and a horizontal mirror plane, then it would be c3h.
alternatively, the arrangement might be such that it has a higher symmetry like d3h.
the key difference between c3h and d3h is the presence of vertical mirror planes in d3h.
if those vertical mirror planes are absent, then the molecule would belong to c3h.
how can vertical mirror planes be absent?
if there are asymmetric substituents that prevent the mirror planes from being present.
for example, if the hexaone groups (ketone substituents) are placed in a way that breaks the vertical mirror planes but maintains the horizontal mirror plane and the threefold rotational axis.
alternatively, let's compare options b and d again.
option b: triphenyleno...trifuran...hexaone.
triphenylene is a tricyclic system with three benzene rings.
trifuran is three furan rings.
so, this molecule seems to be a fusion of triphenylene and trifuran, creating a large annular system.
if triphenylene (three benzene rings) is fused with trifuran (three furan rings) in a symmetric fashion, the resultant molecule might have d3 symmetry.
however, adding hexaone groups (six ketones) could break some symmetry.
however, if the ketone groups are placed symmetrically, the molecule could retain c3h symmetry.
similarly, option d is benzo fused to trifuran, but perhaps in a way that has threefold symmetry.
but since it's only one benzo ring fused to trifuran, maybe the symmetry is lower.
alternatively, considering the numbering on option d: positions 1,3,4,6,7,9.
if the molecule has threefold symmetry, these positions might correspond to symmetrically equivalent positions.
for example, positions 1, 4, 7 might be one set and 3,6,9 another, but arranged in a rotational manner.
alternatively, the positions could be arranged such that the molecule has three ketone groups at 120-degree angles and another three.
but without the exact structure, it's hard to say.
however, between the two options, b is triphenyleno-trifuran, which suggests a larger, more symmetric fused system.
triphenylene itself has a high degree of symmetry.
when fused with trifuran in a symmetric manner, and with hexaone groups placed symmetrically, the molecule could have c3h symmetry.
alternatively, let's consider the other options again.
if option a is d3h, not c3h, and option c has lower symmetry, then options b or d.
but which one?
alternatively, maybe option d is the correct answer.
wait, let's think about the names again.
benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran... implies that the benzo ring is fused to the trifuran at three different positions (1,2; 3,4; 5,6), which suggests a symmetric fusion.
if trifuran is a triangular arrangement of three furan rings, and a benzene ring is fused symmetrically to each of the three furan rings, then the overall structure might have a threefold axis.
however, attaching a benzene ring to each of the three furan rings would make it similar to a triphenylene structure.
but in this case, it's benzo fused to trifuran.
so, perhaps option d's structure is similar to triphenylene but with furan rings instead.
but then how is option b different?
option b is triphenyleno fused to trifuran.
so triphenylene (three benzene rings) fused to trifuran (three furan rings).
that would create a larger polycyclic system with both benzene and furan rings.
if this is arranged in a symmetric way, like a triangular triphenylene unit fused to a triangular trifuran unit, the entire molecule could have c3h symmetry if it's planar with a horizontal mirror plane.
however, if the benzene and furan rings are fused in a way that causes the molecule to deviate from planarity, the mirror plane may be lost.
but the presence of ketone groups (hexaone) might affect the symmetry.
if the ketone groups are placed symmetrically, they might not disrupt the horizontal mirror plane and rotational symmetry.
alternatively, let's recall that in point group determination, for a molecule to have c3h symmetry, it must have a principal c3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane, but not the vertical mirror planes that d3h has.
so, how can a molecule with identical substituents have c3h and not d3h?
it's possible if the molecule is not superimposed on itself by vertical mirror planes.
for example, consider a trigonal planar molecule with three identical substituents that are asymmetric.
each substituent is asymmetric, so reflecting through a vertical plane would not superimpose the molecule onto itself.
however, rotating by 120 degrees would still match.
so, in such a case, the molecule would have c3h symmetry.
going back to triisopropyl borate (option a).
the isopropoxy group is -o-c(ch3)2.
each isopropoxy group is symmetric about the oxygen, but the two methyl groups are attached to the central carbon.
if the boron is trigonal planar, each isopropoxy group is in a plane with the boron.
however, the arrangement of the three groups around the boron: if the groups are identical and the molecule is flat, then the vertical mirror planes would be present, leading to d3h symmetry.
but if the groups are arranged in a way that they are not superimposable with their mirror images, then vertical mirror planes are not present.
however, in reality, triisopropyl borate's structure is likely that the three isopropoxy groups are arranged symmetrically in a plane, leading to d3h symmetry.
so, unless there is some twist or asymmetry in the groups, which is unlikely for a planar molecule, the vertical mirror planes would be present.
therefore, option a is not the correct answer.
so, the correct answer must be one of the other options.
between b and d.
considering that both are complex organic molecules with multiple rings, but option b is triphenyleno fused to trifuran, which suggests a symmetric structure.
triphenylene itself has d3h symmetry.
if fused symmetrically to trifuran, and with hexaone groups placed in a symmetric fashion, the molecule could retain d3h or lower symmetry.
but if the fusion or the substituents break some symmetry, maybe it lowers to c3h.
on the other hand, option d is benzo fused to trifuran.
if this creates a structure with threefold rotational symmetry but no vertical mirror planes, then it could be c3h.
for example, if the benzo ring is fused to one furan in the trifuran, and the other two furans have substituents that make the molecule asymmetrical with respect to the vertical planes.
alternatively, the numbering of the hexaone groups in option d (positions 1,3,4,6,7,9) might be symmetrically arranged.
if the molecule has threefold symmetry, these positions could repeat every three positions.
for example, positions 1,4,7 and 3,6,9.
if the molecule has six positions for the ketones, arranged in two sets of three, this might imply a threefold symmetry.
but again, without the exact structure, it's challenging.
however, considering that triphenylene (as in option b) is a symmetrical system of three benzene rings, when fused to trifuran (three furan rings), it's possible that the molecule retains a high degree of symmetry.
if the hexaone groups are placed in a way that breaks the vertical mirror planes but keeps the horizontal mirror plane and c3 axis, then the symmetry would be c3h.
alternatively, if the benzene and furan rings are arranged in a way that the entire molecule is planar, then the horizontal mirror plane is present.
if there are three identical substituents around a central axis, and each substituent is asymmetrical, then vertical mirror planes would not be present.
for example, in option b, the triphenyleno part is three benzene rings.
fusing each of them to a furan ring (trifuran) might result in each benzene being connected to a furan.
if the fusing is done in a way that each benzene is connected to a furan, forming a symmetric structure, but the hexaone groups (ketones) are placed in a way that breaks the vertical mirror planes, then the molecule would have c3h symmetry.
alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option b.
but why?
let me check the names again.
the correct answer needs to have c3h symmetry.
which of these molecules could have that?
if triisopropyl borate is d3h, then not a.
quinuclidine is likely c1, so not c.
that leaves b and d.
benzo...trifuran...hexaone (option d) versus triphenyleno...trifuran...hexaone (option b).
the key difference is that option b starts with triphenyleno, which is three benzene rings fused in a specific way, while option d starts with benzo, which is one benzene ring.
so, option b is three benzene rings fused to three furan rings (trifuran).
this could create a large, potentially symmetric, annular system.
if the three benzene rings are arranged in a triangle (as in triphenylene) and each is connected to a furan ring, which are in turn connected, forming a trifuran, then the overall structure might have a triangular shape.
if this is all planar, then it has a horizontal mirror plane.
if there's a threefold rotational axis, then that's another symmetry element.
however, if the molecule also has vertical mirror planes, it would be d3h.
to have c3h, it must lack vertical mirror planes.
how?
for example, if the hexaone groups (ketones) are placed in a way that each vertical mirror plane is disrupted.
if the ketone groups are placed asymmetrically with respect to the vertical planes but symmetrically with respect to the threefold axis, then vertical mirror planes would be absent.
however, without knowing the exact positions, it's hard to say.
but considering the numbering in option b: hexaone at positions 1,3,6,8,11,13.
if the molecule has threefold symmetry, these positions might be arranged such that each set of two ketones is repeated every three positions.
alternatively, if the molecule has a repeating unit every three positions, then this could correspond to threefold symmetry.
similarly, in option d, the hexaone positions are 1,3,4,6,7,9.
this might not show a clear threefold symmetry.
alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option d.
wait, let's think about the structures again.
triphenylene is a molecule composed of three benzene rings connected in a cycle.
the structure is like a benzannulated benzene, forming a hexagonal shape with three benzene rings.
when triphenylene is fused to trifuran (three furan rings), creating option b, the resulting molecule might have a similar hexagonal shape but with furan rings replacing some benzenes.
however, the exact fusion points are given by the numbering in the name.
the name triphenyleno[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran... suggests that each benzene ring in the triphenylene is connected to a furan ring in the trifuran.
the numbering implies that the fusion occurs at multiple points.
if the result is a planar molecule with threefold rotational symmetry but no vertical mirror planes due to the arrangement of the hexaone groups, then it would have c3h symmetry.
on the other hand, option d is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran..., which suggests that a single benzene ring is fused to the trifuran at three different positions.
this could result in a y-shaped molecule or some other structure, but it's not immediately clear.
given that the question is multiple choice, and considering that triphenylene is a symmetrical structure, option b is more likely to have the required symmetry.
however, the presence of hexaone groups (six ketone groups) might disrupt symmetry.
but if they are placed symmetrically, the molecule could retain c3h.
for example, if each of the three furan rings in the trifuran has two ketone groups placed in a way that is symmetric with respect to the threefold axis but not to the vertical planes, then the molecule would have c3h symmetry.
alternatively, if the hexaone groups are placed at positions that are equivalent under c3 rotation but not under vertical mirrors, then the symmetry is c3h.
the positions given in option b are 1,3,6,8,11,13.
if the molecule has positions numbered such that these six positions are equivalent under rotation by 120 degrees, then that would imply threefold rotational symmetry.
however, without the exact structure, it's difficult to be certain.
alternatively, the correct answer is option b.
but why?
let me check the other options again.
option d: benzo...trifuran..., which is a single benzene fused to trifuran.
this is less likely to have threefold symmetry than option b, which is triphenyleno fused to trifuran.
therefore, option b is more likely to have the required c3h symmetry.
therefore, the answer should be b.
**final answer** 
\boxed{b}
</think>

answer: to determine which molecule has c3h symmetry, we need to consider the molecular structure and symmetry elements. c3h symmetry includes a three-fold rotational axis (c3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh).

1. **triisopropyl borate (option a)**:
   - structure: b(oc(ch3)2)3 with three isopropoxy groups attached trigonal planar around boron.
   - symmetry: if planar, it would have d3h symmetry (c3 axis and vertical mirror planes). however, if the substituents are asymmetrical, it could reduce to c3h. but identical substituents likely maintain d3h symmetry, so not c3h.

2. **quinuclidine (option c)**:
   - structure: bridged bicyclic amine with a six-membered and a five-membered ring.
   - symmetry: chiral with low symmetry (likely c1), not c3h.

3. **benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone (option d)**:
   - structure: benzene fused to three furan rings with six ketone groups.
   - symmetry: complex structure, but likely lower symmetry due to single benzene fusion and ketone placement, not clear c3h symmetry.

4. **triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone (option b)**:
   - structure: three benzene rings (triphenylene) fused to three furan rings with six ketone groups.
   - symmetry: triphenylene core provides potential three-fold symmetry. if fused planar with trifuran and ketone groups placed symmetrically around the c3 axis but asymmetrical in vertical planes, it results in c3h symmetry. the positions of the ketone groups (1,3,6,8,11,13) suggest symmetry compatible with c3h.

after evaluating all options, the molecule with c3h symmetry is:

\boxed{b}
