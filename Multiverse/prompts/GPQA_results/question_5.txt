Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. It's about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator \(\vec{P}\) for a muon along an arbitrary direction \(\vec{n}\) in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue we're looking for is \(+\hbar/2\). The problem gives the matrix representations for the X, Y, and Z components of the operator \(P\). The answer choices are in terms of trigonometric functions with angles θ and φ, but wait, the options mention θ and φ, but the problem doesn't explicitly give angles θ or φ. Hmm, maybe since \(\vec{n}\) is in the x-z plane, the direction is specified by θ (polar angle) and φ (azimuthal angle), but since it's in x-z, φ might be zero or something. Wait, the x-z plane would typically have φ = 0 or π/2? Wait, in spherical coordinates, the x-z plane is when φ = 0, because φ is the azimuthal angle in the x-y plane from the x-axis. So if a vector is in the x-z plane, its φ is 0, because it has no y-component. So maybe φ is 0 here, but the problem states an arbitrary direction in x-z plane, so maybe φ is fixed at 0, and θ is the polar angle from the z-axis? Wait, in particle physics, sometimes the z-axis is taken as the direction of measurement, but in this case, the problem says an arbitrary direction in x-z plane. Let me confirm.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: Determine the relationship between the polar angle θ and the direction of the vector \(\vec{n}\) in the x-z plane.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: Identify the specific direction of the vector \(\vec{n}\) within the x-z plane.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The vector \(\vec{n}\) is positioned in the x-z plane, meaning its y-component is zero. The angle θ, the polar angle measured from the positive z-axis, defines the direction of \(\vec{n}\) within this plane.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The vector \(\vec{n}\) is situated within the x-z plane, implying it possesses no y-component.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The vector \(\vec{n}\) lies in the x-z plane, characterized by a zero y-component. Its direction is defined by the polar angle θ from the positive z-axis.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So in spherical coordinates, that would be (r, θ, 0), where φ = 0. So the direction is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but since it's a unit vector. Wait, wait, if φ = 0, then the x-component is sinθ, z-component is cosθ. Right, because in spherical coordinates, x = r sinθ cosφ, y = r sinθ sinφ, z = r cosθ. So if φ = 0, then x = r sinθ, z = r cosθ. So the unit vector in the x-z plane is (sinθ, 0, cosθ).
But in this problem, they just mention that the direction \(\vec{n}\) is in the x-z plane. So the operator \(\vec{P}\) along \(\vec{n}\) would be a combination of the Pauli matrices in the x and z directions, since the y-component is zero.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: Determine the general form of the operator \(\vec{P}\) for a direction in the x-z plane.

<Outline>
2: Identify the specific components of the operator \(\vec{P}\) for a direction in the x-z plane.

<Path>
1: The operator \(\vec{P}\) is constructed by combining the given \(P_x\), \(P_y\), and \(P_z\) components, weighted by the direction cosines of the unit vector \(\vec{n}\).
</Path>
<Path>
2: The operator \(\vec{P}\) is expressed as \(P_x \sin\theta + P_z \cos\theta\), which simplifies to \(\hbar/2 ( \sigma_x \sin\theta + \sigma_z \cos\theta )\), where \(\sigma_x\) and \(\sigma_z\) are Pauli matrices.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The operator \(\vec{P}\) for a direction in the x-z plane is formed by linearly combining its x and z components. Its explicit form is \(\hbar/2 ( \sigma_x \sin\theta + \sigma_z \cos\theta )\), utilizing the specified Pauli matrices.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
But the problem says "the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator \(\vec{P}\) for a muon along an arbitrary direction \(\vec{n}\) lying in the x-z plane". So the operator is \(\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}\), which would be \(P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z\). But since \(\vec{n}\) is in the x-z plane, \(n_y = 0\). So the operator simplifies to \(P_x n_x + P_z n_z\). Given that \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector, \(n_x = \sin\theta\), \(n_z = \cos\theta\) (assuming θ is from the z-axis). So then the operator becomes \(P_x \sin\theta + P_z \cos\theta\).
But let's confirm the Pauli matrices given. The problem states:
- \(P_x\) is \(\hbar/2\) times the matrix [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
- \(P_y\) is \(\hbar/2\) times the matrix [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
- \(P_z\) is \(\hbar/2\) times the matrix [[1, 0], [0, -1]]
So indeed, these are the standard Pauli matrices multiplied by \(\hbar/2\).
Therefore, the operator \(\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}\) would be:
\( \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z \)
Since \(n_y = 0\), this becomes \(P_x n_x + P_z n_z\).
Expressed in terms of matrices:
\( \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = (\hbar/2) \left( \sigma_x n_x + \sigma_z n_z \right ) \)
But since \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector in x-z plane, \(n_x = \sin\theta\), \(n_z = \cos\theta\). Therefore:
\( \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = (\hbar/2) \left( \sigma_x \sin\theta + \sigma_z \cos\theta \right ) \)
So we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\).
So let's set up the eigenvalue equation:
\( \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} |v\rangle = (\hbar/2) |v\rangle \)
Therefore, the operator \( \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} \) is:
\( (\hbar/2) \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{pmatrix} \)
Let's think in parallel.

1: The first component of the eigenvalue equation, \(\frac{\hbar}{2} ( \cos\theta \cdot a + \sin\theta \cdot b ) = \frac{\hbar}{2} a\), simplifies to \(\cos\theta \cdot a + \sin\theta \cdot b = a\).

<Path>
2: The second equation, derived from the eigenvalue equation's second component, is \(\sin\theta a - \cos\theta b = b\).
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The first equation, \(\cos\theta \cdot a + \sin\theta \cdot b = a\), and the second equation, \(\sin\theta \cdot a - \cos\theta \cdot b = b\), were derived from the eigenvalue equation.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Simplify both equations:
First equation:
\( \cosθ a + \sinθ b = a \)
Subtract cosθ a:
\( \sinθ b = a (1 - \cosθ ) \)
So:
\( a = \frac{\sinθ}{1 - \cosθ} b \)
But let's hold that expression.
Second equation:
\( \sinθ a - \cosθ b = b \)
Subtract -cosθ b:
\( \sinθ a = b (1 + \cosθ ) \)
So:
\( b = \frac{\sinθ}{1 + \cosθ} a \)
Hm, so we have two expressions relating a and b. Let's check consistency.
From the first equation: \( a = \frac{\sinθ}{1 - \cosθ} b \)
From the second equation: \( b = \frac{\sinθ}{1 + \cosθ} a \)
Let's substitute the expression of a from the first into the second equation:
\( b = \frac{\sinθ}{1 + \cosθ} \left( \frac{\sinθ}{1 - \cosθ} b \right ) \)
Simplify the right-hand side:
\( b = \frac{\sinθ \cdot \sinθ}{(1 + \cosθ)(1 - \cosθ)} b \)
Note that the denominator is (1 - cos2θ) = sin2θ, so:
\( b = \frac{\sin^2θ}{\sin^2θ} b = b \)
So this is consistent; the equation reduces to b = b. Therefore, the two equations are not independent, as expected for a 2x2 matrix. So we can choose one of them to express a in terms of b or vice versa.
Let's use the first equation: \( a = \frac{\sinθ}{1 - \cosθ} b \)
Let's let b = 1, then a = sinθ / (1 - cosθ )
But we need to normalize the vector. Let's compute the normalization.
The eigenvector is \( |v\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix} \)
Normalization requires \( |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1 \)
If we set b = 1, then:
\( |a|2 + |1|2 = 1 \implies |a|2 = 0 ⇒ a=0 \), but that's not possible if sinθ / (1 - cosθ). Wait, maybe we need to parameterize better.
Alternatively, let's express in terms of trigonometric identities.
Note that \( \frac{\sinθ}{1 - \cosθ} \) can be simplified using trigonometric identities.
Recall that \( 1 - \cosθ = 2 \sin2(θ/2) \), and \( \sinθ = 2 \sin(θ/2) \cos(θ/2) \).
So:
\( \frac{\sinθ}{1 - \cosθ} = \frac{2 \sin(θ/2) \cos(θ/2)}{2 \sin2(θ/2)} } = \frac{\cos(θ/2)}{\sin(θ/2)} = \cot(θ/2) \)
So \( a = \cot(θ/2) b \)
Alternatively, let's write:
From the first equation: a / b = sinθ / (1 - cosθ ) = cot(θ/2)
Therefore, if we set b = sin(θ/2), then a = cot(θ/2) sin(θ/2) = cos(θ/2).
Therefore, the components would be a = cos(θ/2), b = sin(θ/2), which automatically normalizes since cos2(θ/2) + sin2(θ/2) = 1.
Let's think in parallel.

The parameterization yields eigenvector components \(a = \cos(\theta/2)\) and \(b = \sin(\theta/2)\), which form a normalized eigenvector.

Wait, that seems to match option B: (\cos(θ/2), \sin(θ/2)). But wait, let's verify this.
Wait, if a = cos(θ/2), b = sin(θ/2), then the eigenvector is as in option B. But looking back at our earlier expression, if we set b = sin(θ/2), then a = cos(θ/2). But how did we get here?
Alternatively, from a = cot(θ/2) b. If we let b = sin(θ/2), then a = cot(θ/2) sin(θ/2) = [cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2)] sin(θ/2) = cos(θ/2). Hence, the components are (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)), which is normalized.
Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)), which is option B.
But wait, let's check the answer choices again.
The answer choices are:
A) (\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)
B) (\cos(\theta/2), \sin (\theta/2))
C) (\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin (\theta/2))
D) (\cos(\theta), e^{i\phi}\sin (\theta))
Hmm. Option B is exactly (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)). But wait, the problem says "the elements of the normalized eigenvector". Since in quantum mechanics, eigenvectors are defined up to a phase. However, the components here are real, so the eigenvector is given by B.
But let me check the other options. Option D has a phase factor e^{iφ}, but since the vector is in x-z plane, φ is 0, so that component would be real. But the answer D is (cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ). If φ =0, it's (cosθ, sinθ), but that's not the answer we got. We got (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)).
Wait, why not (cosθ, sinθ)? Let's verify.
Suppose θ is the angle from the z-axis. Let's test for θ = 0. If θ=0, then the direction is along the z-axis. The eigenvector for +\hbar/2 eigenvalue of P_z is (1,0), because P_z is diagonal. If θ=0, then according to option B, the eigenvector would be (cos0, sin0) = (1,0), which is correct.
If θ = π, then the operator points in the negative z-direction. Then the eigenvector should be (0,1). Let's see: cos(π/2) is 0, sin(π/2) is 1. So (0,1), correct. So that works.
What if θ = π/2, pointing in the x-direction. Then the operator is P_x. The eigenvector for +\hbar/2 should be (1,1)/sqrt(2). But according to option B, cos(π/4) = sqrt(2)/2, sin(π/4) = sqrt(2)/2, so (sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2), which is (1,1)/sqrt(2) when normalized, which is correct for P_x. So that matches.
Therefore, option B seems correct. But let me check the other options.
Let's think in parallel.

3: Determine the validity of option D by examining its structure, the given context, and consistency with the derived eigenvector.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: Option C proposes \(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2\), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin (\theta/2))\)). The normalization factor is \sqrt{2/3} and \sqrt{1/3}, which summing \sqrt{2/3} \cos^2 (\theta/2) + \sqrt{1/3} \sin^2 (\theta/2) is (2/3 \cos^2 (\theta/2) + (1/3)\hbar^2 \sin^2 (\theta/2) ) This expression further reduces to \hbar^2 (\theta/2) + \h^2 3 \sin^2 (\theta/2), which equals \h^2 ( \cos^2 (\theta/2) + \sin^2 (\theta/2) ) / 3. Applying the Pythagorean identity to (1 + \cos \theta) ) / 3. This expression is not equal to 1, so Option C is not normalized. Therefore, Option C is incorrect.
</Path>
<Path>
2: Option C proposes (\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2\), \sqrt{1/3}h\h \sin (\theta/2)\)). This form is a combination of the normalized eigenvector derived from B scaled by \hbar and involves \cos(\theta/2 and \sin\theta/2 terms. The components are scaled by \sqrt{2/3}\hbar and the sum is (2/3) hbar^2 \cos^2\theta/2 + (1/3) h^2 \sin^2\theta/2. This simplifies to \h^2 (\cos^2(\theta2) + 1/3 \sin^2 (\theta/2). The factor \h^2 (2 \cos^2 (\theta/2) + sin \sin^2 (\theta/2)) ) / 3. This further simplifies to \h^2 \cos \theta) ) / 3. This value is not consistently 1 for all theta. Consequently, option C is not normalized. This normalization confirms that option C is incorrect.
</Path>
<Path>
3: Option D proposes the eigenvector (\sqrt{2/3}\hbar\cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\h\sin (\theta/2) ) \sqrtvector's components are \sqrt{2/3}\hbar and \sqrt{1/3}\hbar terms. This form is inconsistent with the derived eigenvector structure. The normalization \ of this vector is also problematic, as its squared magnitude is (2/3) \h^2 \cos^2 (\theta/2 + (1/3) \h^2 \sin^2 (\theta/2. This sum is ((2/3) \cos^2 (\theta/2 + 1/3 \sin^2 \theta/2) ), which equals ( (2cos^2^2 (\theta/2) + \sin^2 \theta/2) ) / 3. This further simplifies to (2(1 + cos^2 (\theta)) ) / 3. This is not equal to unity, as it is not normalized. Option C is incorrect. Option D suggests (\cos(\theta), e^{i\phi} \sin (\theta)). This form appears related to spherical harmonics. However, the problem specifies the direction lies in the x-z plane, implying \phi = 0 or \pi. If \phi = 0, the vector becomes (\cos\theta, \sin\theta). This form does not match the derived eigenvector (cos(\theta/2), sin(\theta/2)). For example, if the operator points in the x-direction (\theta = \pi/2, \phi = 0), the eigenvector should be (cos(\pi/4), sin(\pi/4)) = (\sqrt{2}/2, \sqrt{2}/2). Option D for \theta = \pi/2, \phi = 0 would give (\cos(\pi/2), \sin(\pi/2)), which is (0, 1). This is incorrect, as the eigenvector should be (\sqrt{2}/2, \sqrt{2}/2). Therefore, Option D is incorrect.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
Option A is invalid due to its structure and lack of normalization. Option C is incorrect because its form is inconsistent with the derived eigenvector and it fails the normalization test. Option D is incorrect because its structure does not match the derived eigenvector and specific examples demonstrate its inaccuracy.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So after going through each option, the only one that matches is option B.
Therefore, the answer should be B.
**Final Answer**
\boxed{B}
</Think>

Answer: To solve the problem of finding the eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator \(\vec{P}\) for a muon along an arbitrary direction \(\vec{n}\) in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\), we start by understanding the given components of the operator \(\vec{P}\). The operator \(\vec{P}\) is a combination of the Pauli matrices scaled by \(\hbar/2\).

Given that \(\vec{n}\) lies in the x-z plane, the direction can be specified by the polar angle \(\theta\) with components \(n_x = \sin\theta\) and \(n_z = \cos\theta\). The operator \(\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}\) is then constructed as:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = (\hbar/2) \left( \sigma_x \sin\theta + \sigma_z \cos\theta \right)
\]
This results in the matrix:
\[
(\hbar/2) \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{pmatrix}
\]

We need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\). Setting up the eigenvalue equation, we solve for the eigenvector components \(a\) and \(b\) by solving the system of equations derived from the matrix equation. Through trigonometric identities and normalization, we find that the eigenvector components are:
\[
a = \cos(\theta/2) \quad \text{and} \quad b = \sin(\theta/2)
\]

This results in the normalized eigenvector \((\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))\), which matches option B. Verifying with specific cases (e.g., \(\theta = 0\), \(\theta = \pi\), and \(\theta = \pi/2\)) confirms the correctness of this eigenvector.

Thus, the correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]

so in spherical coordinates, that would be (r, θ, 0), where φ = 0. so the direction is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but since it's a unit vector. wait, wait, if φ = 0, then the x-component is sinθ, z-component is cosθ. right, because in spherical coordinates, x = r sinθ cosφ, y = r sinθ sinφ, z = r cosθ. so if φ = 0, then x = r sinθ, z = r cosθ. so the unit vector in the x-z plane is (sinθ, 0, cosθ).
but in this problem, they just mention that the direction \(\vec{n}\) is in the x-z plane. so the operator \(\vec{p}\) along \(\vec{n}\) would be a combination of the pauli matrices in the x and z directions, since the y-component is zero.

2: the operator \(\vec{p}\) is expressed as \(p_x \sin\theta + p_z \cos\theta\), which simplifies to \(\hbar/2 ( \sigma_x \sin\theta + \sigma_z \cos\theta )\), where \(\sigma_x\) and \(\sigma_z\) are pauli matrices.

the operator \(\vec{p}\) for a direction in the x-z plane is formed by linearly combining its x and z components. its explicit form is \(\hbar/2 ( \sigma_x \sin\theta + \sigma_z \cos\theta )\), utilizing the specified pauli matrices.

but the problem says "the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator \(\vec{p}\) for a muon along an arbitrary direction \(\vec{n}\) lying in the x-z plane". so the operator is \(\vec{p} \cdot \vec{n}\), which would be \(p_x n_x + p_y n_y + p_z n_z\). but since \(\vec{n}\) is in the x-z plane, \(n_y = 0\). so the operator simplifies to \(p_x n_x + p_z n_z\). given that \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector, \(n_x = \sin\theta\), \(n_z = \cos\theta\) (assuming θ is from the z-axis). so then the operator becomes \(p_x \sin\theta + p_z \cos\theta\).
but let's confirm the pauli matrices given. the problem states:
- \(p_x\) is \(\hbar/2\) times the matrix [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
- \(p_y\) is \(\hbar/2\) times the matrix [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
- \(p_z\) is \(\hbar/2\) times the matrix [[1, 0], [0, -1]]
so indeed, these are the standard pauli matrices multiplied by \(\hbar/2\).
therefore, the operator \(\vec{p} \cdot \vec{n}\) would be:
\( \vec{p} \cdot \vec{n} = p_x n_x + p_y n_y + p_z n_z \)
since \(n_y = 0\), this becomes \(p_x n_x + p_z n_z\).
expressed in terms of matrices:
\( \vec{p} \cdot \vec{n} = (\hbar/2) \left( \sigma_x n_x + \sigma_z n_z \right ) \)
but since \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector in x-z plane, \(n_x = \sin\theta\), \(n_z = \cos\theta\). therefore:
\( \vec{p} \cdot \vec{n} = (\hbar/2) \left( \sigma_x \sin\theta + \sigma_z \cos\theta \right ) \)
so we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\).
so let's set up the eigenvalue equation:
\( \vec{p} \cdot \vec{n} |v\rangle = (\hbar/2) |v\rangle \)
therefore, the operator \( \vec{p} \cdot \vec{n} \) is:
\( (\hbar/2) \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{pmatrix} \)

</conclusion>
</parallel>
simplify both equations:
first equation:
\( \cosθ a + \sinθ b = a \)
subtract cosθ a:
\( \sinθ b = a (1 - \cosθ ) \)
so:
\( a = \frac{\sinθ}{1 - \cosθ} b \)
but let's hold that expression.
second equation:
\( \sinθ a - \cosθ b = b \)
subtract -cosθ b:
\( \sinθ a = b (1 + \cosθ ) \)
so:
\( b = \frac{\sinθ}{1 + \cosθ} a \)
hm, so we have two expressions relating a and b. let's check consistency.
from the first equation: \( a = \frac{\sinθ}{1 - \cosθ} b \)
from the second equation: \( b = \frac{\sinθ}{1 + \cosθ} a \)
let's substitute the expression of a from the first into the second equation:
\( b = \frac{\sinθ}{1 + \cosθ} \left( \frac{\sinθ}{1 - \cosθ} b \right ) \)
simplify the right-hand side:
\( b = \frac{\sinθ \cdot \sinθ}{(1 + \cosθ)(1 - \cosθ)} b \)
note that the denominator is (1 - cos2θ) = sin2θ, so:
\( b = \frac{\sin^2θ}{\sin^2θ} b = b \)
so this is consistent; the equation reduces to b = b. therefore, the two equations are not independent, as expected for a 2x2 matrix. so we can choose one of them to express a in terms of b or vice versa.
let's use the first equation: \( a = \frac{\sinθ}{1 - \cosθ} b \)
let's let b = 1, then a = sinθ / (1 - cosθ )
but we need to normalize the vector. let's compute the normalization.
the eigenvector is \( |v\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix} \)
normalization requires \( |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1 \)
if we set b = 1, then:
\( |a|2 + |1|2 = 1 \implies |a|2 = 0 ⇒ a=0 \), but that's not possible if sinθ / (1 - cosθ). wait, maybe we need to parameterize better.
alternatively, let's express in terms of trigonometric identities.
note that \( \frac{\sinθ}{1 - \cosθ} \) can be simplified using trigonometric identities.
recall that \( 1 - \cosθ = 2 \sin2(θ/2) \), and \( \sinθ = 2 \sin(θ/2) \cos(θ/2) \).
so:
\( \frac{\sinθ}{1 - \cosθ} = \frac{2 \sin(θ/2) \cos(θ/2)}{2 \sin2(θ/2)} } = \frac{\cos(θ/2)}{\sin(θ/2)} = \cot(θ/2) \)
so \( a = \cot(θ/2) b \)
alternatively, let's write:
from the first equation: a / b = sinθ / (1 - cosθ ) = cot(θ/2)
therefore, if we set b = sin(θ/2), then a = cot(θ/2) sin(θ/2) = cos(θ/2).
therefore, the components would be a = cos(θ/2), b = sin(θ/2), which automatically normalizes since cos2(θ/2) + sin2(θ/2) = 1.
let's think in parallel.

<conclusion>
the parameterization yields eigenvector components \(a = \cos(\theta/2)\) and \(b = \sin(\theta/2)\), which form a normalized eigenvector.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
wait, that seems to match option b: (\cos(θ/2), \sin(θ/2)). but wait, let's verify this.
wait, if a = cos(θ/2), b = sin(θ/2), then the eigenvector is as in option b. but looking back at our earlier expression, if we set b = sin(θ/2), then a = cos(θ/2). but how did we get here?
alternatively, from a = cot(θ/2) b. if we let b = sin(θ/2), then a = cot(θ/2) sin(θ/2) = [cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2)] sin(θ/2) = cos(θ/2). hence, the components are (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)), which is normalized.
therefore, the normalized eigenvector is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)), which is option b.
but wait, let's check the answer choices again.
the answer choices are:
a) (\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)
b) (\cos(\theta/2), \sin (\theta/2))
c) (\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin (\theta/2))
d) (\cos(\theta), e^{i\phi}\sin (\theta))
hmm. option b is exactly (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)). but wait, the problem says "the elements of the normalized eigenvector". since in quantum mechanics, eigenvectors are defined up to a phase. however, the components here are real, so the eigenvector is given by b.
but let me check the other options. option d has a phase factor e^{iφ}, but since the vector is in x-z plane, φ is 0, so that component would be real. but the answer d is (cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ). if φ =0, it's (cosθ, sinθ), but that's not the answer we got. we got (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)).
wait, why not (cosθ, sinθ)? let's verify.
suppose θ is the angle from the z-axis. let's test for θ = 0. if θ=0, then the direction is along the z-axis. the eigenvector for +\hbar/2 eigenvalue of p_z is (1,0), because p_z is diagonal. if θ=0, then according to option b, the eigenvector would be (cos0, sin0) = (1,0), which is correct.
if θ = π, then the operator points in the negative z-direction. then the eigenvector should be (0,1). let's see: cos(π/2) is 0, sin(π/2) is 1. so (0,1), correct. so that works.
what if θ = π/2, pointing in the x-direction. then the operator is p_x. the eigenvector for +\hbar/2 should be (1,1)/sqrt(2). but according to option b, cos(π/4) = sqrt(2)/2, sin(π/4) = sqrt(2)/2, so (sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2), which is (1,1)/sqrt(2) when normalized, which is correct for p_x. so that matches.
therefore, option b seems correct. but let me check the other options.

<path>
1: option c proposes \(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2\), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin (\theta/2))\)). the normalization factor is \sqrt{2/3} and \sqrt{1/3}, which summing \sqrt{2/3} \cos^2 (\theta/2) + \sqrt{1/3} \sin^2 (\theta/2) is (2/3 \cos^2 (\theta/2) + (1/3)\hbar^2 \sin^2 (\theta/2) ) this expression further reduces to \hbar^2 (\theta/2) + \h^2 3 \sin^2 (\theta/2), which equals \h^2 ( \cos^2 (\theta/2) + \sin^2 (\theta/2) ) / 3. applying the pythagorean identity to (1 + \cos \theta) ) / 3. this expression is not equal to 1, so option c is not normalized. therefore, option c is incorrect.
</path>
<path>
2: option c proposes (\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2\), \sqrt{1/3}h\h \sin (\theta/2)\)). this form is a combination of the normalized eigenvector derived from b scaled by \hbar and involves \cos(\theta/2 and \sin\theta/2 terms. the components are scaled by \sqrt{2/3}\hbar and the sum is (2/3) hbar^2 \cos^2\theta/2 + (1/3) h^2 \sin^2\theta/2. this simplifies to \h^2 (\cos^2(\theta2) + 1/3 \sin^2 (\theta/2). the factor \h^2 (2 \cos^2 (\theta/2) + sin \sin^2 (\theta/2)) ) / 3. this further simplifies to \h^2 \cos \theta) ) / 3. this value is not consistently 1 for all theta. consequently, option c is not normalized. this normalization confirms that option c is incorrect.
</path>
<path>
3: option d proposes the eigenvector (\sqrt{2/3}\hbar\cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\h\sin (\theta/2) ) \sqrtvector's components are \sqrt{2/3}\hbar and \sqrt{1/3}\hbar terms. this form is inconsistent with the derived eigenvector structure. the normalization \ of this vector is also problematic, as its squared magnitude is (2/3) \h^2 \cos^2 (\theta/2 + (1/3) \h^2 \sin^2 (\theta/2. this sum is ((2/3) \cos^2 (\theta/2 + 1/3 \sin^2 \theta/2) ), which equals ( (2cos^2^2 (\theta/2) + \sin^2 \theta/2) ) / 3. this further simplifies to (2(1 + cos^2 (\theta)) ) / 3. this is not equal to unity, as it is not normalized. option c is incorrect. option d suggests (\cos(\theta), e^{i\phi} \sin (\theta)). this form appears related to spherical harmonics. however, the problem specifies the direction lies in the x-z plane, implying \phi = 0 or \pi. if \phi = 0, the vector becomes (\cos\theta, \sin\theta). this form does not match the derived eigenvector (cos(\theta/2), sin(\theta/2)). for example, if the operator points in the x-direction (\theta = \pi/2, \phi = 0), the eigenvector should be (cos(\pi/4), sin(\pi/4)) = (\sqrt{2}/2, \sqrt{2}/2). option d for \theta = \pi/2, \phi = 0 would give (\cos(\pi/2), \sin(\pi/2)), which is (0, 1). this is incorrect, as the eigenvector should be (\sqrt{2}/2, \sqrt{2}/2). therefore, option d is incorrect.
</path>
<conclusion>
option a is invalid due to its structure and lack of normalization. option c is incorrect because its form is inconsistent with the derived eigenvector and it fails the normalization test. option d is incorrect because its structure does not match the derived eigenvector and specific examples demonstrate its inaccuracy.
</conclusion>

so after going through each option, the only one that matches is option b.
therefore, the answer should be b.
**final answer**
\boxed{b}
</think>

answer: to solve the problem of finding the eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator \(\vec{p}\) for a muon along an arbitrary direction \(\vec{n}\) in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\), we start by understanding the given components of the operator \(\vec{p}\). the operator \(\vec{p}\) is a combination of the pauli matrices scaled by \(\hbar/2\).

given that \(\vec{n}\) lies in the x-z plane, the direction can be specified by the polar angle \(\theta\) with components \(n_x = \sin\theta\) and \(n_z = \cos\theta\). the operator \(\vec{p} \cdot \vec{n}\) is then constructed as:
\[
\vec{p} \cdot \vec{n} = (\hbar/2) \left( \sigma_x \sin\theta + \sigma_z \cos\theta \right)
\]
this results in the matrix:
\[
(\hbar/2) \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{pmatrix}
\]

we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\). setting up the eigenvalue equation, we solve for the eigenvector components \(a\) and \(b\) by solving the system of equations derived from the matrix equation. through trigonometric identities and normalization, we find that the eigenvector components are:
\[
a = \cos(\theta/2) \quad \text{and} \quad b = \sin(\theta/2)
\]

this results in the normalized eigenvector \((\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))\), which matches option b. verifying with specific cases (e.g., \(\theta = 0\), \(\theta = \pi\), and \(\theta = \pi/2\)) confirms the correctness of this eigenvector.

thus, the correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{b}
\]
