Okay, let's tackle this NMR problem. I need to identify the unknown compound based on the given 1H NMR data. The options are between cis-propenyl acetate, trans-propenyl acetate, cis-butenyl acetate, or trans-butenyl acetate. The NMR data provided is:

7.0 ppm (1H, doublet, J = 16.0 Hz)
5.5 ppm (1H, doublet of quartets)
2.1 ppm (3H, singlet)
1.6 ppm (3H, doublet)

First, let me recall what each type of acetate would look like structurally. Acetate is a common group, CH3COO-, so the structure should have a ester group. The difference between propenyl and butenyl is the number of carbons: propenyl would have a 3-carbon chain with a double bond, and butenyl would have a 4-carbon chain with a double bond. The cis and trans refer to the configuration around the double bond, whether the substituents are on the same side (cis) or opposite sides (trans).

Looking at the NMR peaks, let's start with the downfield region. The 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with a coupling constant of 16.0 Hz. High chemical shifts around 7.0 ppm usually indicate a proton near an electron-withdrawing group, like an ester. The doublet suggests it's coupled only to one other proton. A coupling constant of 16 Hz is typical for a vinyl proton; the C=C double bond causes coupling between adjacent protons. So this likely belongs to a double bond.

Next, the 5.5 ppm peak is a doublet of quartets (dq). This chemical shift is also in the aromatic/allylic region. A doublet of quartets implies coupling with two different neighboring protons. Let's think about the possible structures. If there's a double bond, the protons adjacent to the carbonyl group in the ester might show coupling with each other and possibly with other protons.

The 2.1 ppm singlet integrating for 3H must be a methyl group (CH3) that's likely attached to an electronegative atom, like oxygen in the acetate. The singlet tells us it's not adjacent to any other protons, so it's probably at the end of a chain, maybe the acetate's methyl group.

Then the 1.6 ppm doublet for 3H. A doublet usually means coupling with one other proton. This could be a methyl group attached to a carbon that's next to another proton. Alternatively, maybe a CH3 group attached to a carbon adjacent to the double bond.

Let me try to piece this together. Let's consider the structures of propenyl and butenyl acetates.

Starting with propenyl acetate: structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-OAc (maybe). Wait, no. Actually, propenyl acetate would be more like CH2=CHCOOCH3, but wait, no. Wait, acetate is CH3COO- attached to a propenyl group (which is a 3-carbon chain with a double bond). Let me draw it out.

Propenyl group is CH2=CH-CH2-; attaching acetate to that. So possible structures:

1. CH2=CH-CH2-OAc (all trans)
2. CH2=CHCOOCH3? Wait, no. Wait, acetate is CH3COO-, so if it's propenyl acetate, the propenyl group is attached to the carbonyl. Wait, maybe I'm confused here. Let's clarify.

The structure of propenyl acetate should be CH2=CH-CH2-CO-OCH3? No, wait, no. Wait, acetate is CH3COO-; the propenyl group would be a substituent on the ester. So perhaps the structure is OAc-CH2-CH=CH2? Or OAc-C(CH3)=CH2? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetate is attached to one end of the propenyl group. So the propenyl acetate would have the structure CH2=CH-CH2-OAc. Then, depending on the configuration, the double bond could be between C1 and C2 (if it's propenyl), so for trans, the groups would be opposite, and cis would have them on the same side. Wait, but propenyl group is three carbons with a double bond. So possible structures:

Propenyl acetate: the double bond could be between C1 and C2 (CH2=CH-CH2-OAc) or between C2 and C3 (CH2-CH=CH-OAc). But perhaps the acetate is on the end. Hmm, maybe I need to think in another way.

Alternatively, butenyl acetate would have a four-carbon chain. For example, CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-OAc (but that would be butenyl), but depending on the position of the double bond. Butenyl would have the double bond between C2 and C3 in something like CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, but butenyl can have double bonds in different positions (like between C1-C2 or C2-C3). But given the options are cis or trans butenyl or propenyl, maybe the butenyl is between C2 and C3 of a four-carbon chain.

But maybe the key is in the NMR data. Let's look at the splitting patterns.

The 7.0 ppm signal is a doublet (J=16 Hz). Since coupling constants over 10 Hz are typical for vinyl protons (adjacent protons on a double bond), this suggests that the proton in question is part of a double bond. The fact that it's a doublet means it's coupled only to one other proton. So this proton has one adjacent proton on the double bond. That would mean the double bond is at the end of a chain, so that there's only one neighboring proton. For example, if the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc, the proton at the end (CH2-OAc) would be a doublet because it's only coupled to the CH proton. Wait, but maybe the 7.0 ppm is the CH proton in CH2=CH-?

Wait, in the structure CH2=CH-CH2-OAc, the double bond is between positions 1 and 2. The CH2 group attached to oxygen would be next. The protons on the double bond would have coupling. Let me break it down.

In such a structure, the CH2 group next to the ester would be -CH2-OAc. The CH group in the double bond would be CH2=CH-; each CH in the double bond has two protons. Wait, no. For CH2=CH-CH2-OAc, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The C2 (CH2=CH-) has two protons, and the C1 (CH2=) also has two protons. Then C3 is CH2-OAc, with two protons. But the OAc is -O-CH2-CO-.

But maybe I need to consider coupling between the protons in the double bond. Wait, in a trans-configuration, the protons on the double bond are equivalent if the substituents are the same. Hmm, but if the substituents are different (like one side has a CH2-OAc group and the other is hydrogen), then the protons may not be equivalent.

Alternatively, if the structure is something like CH2=CHCOOCH3 (acrylic acid methyl ester?), but acetate is CH3COO-, so that would be different.

Wait, the problem is about propenyl or butenyl acetate. Let's think about propenyl acetate. The propenyl group is a three-carbon chain with a double bond. If the acetate is attached to one end, then the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-OAc (if the double bond is between C1 and C2), or CH2-CH=CH-OAc (double bond between C2 and C3). The position of the double bond can affect the NMR.

Similarly, butenyl acetate would have a four-carbon chain. The double bond position would again affect the splitting.

Given the NMR data:

- 7.0 ppm, doublet, J=16 Hz: This is likely a proton adjacent to an ester group, probably in a conjugated system. But 7.0 ppm is a bit low for a benzene ring, so more likely an ester or possibly a conjugated double bond.

- 5.5 ppm, dq: This signal is downfield of the 7.0 ppm, which is unusual unless there are electron-withdrawing groups. Alternatively, maybe this is an allylic proton. Allylic protons (next to a double bond) can have splitting patterns based on coupling with adjacent protons.

Let me think about possible structures. Suppose we have a butenyl acetate. Let's consider cis vs. trans. For example, if the butenyl group is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2- and the acetate is attached to the end, but that would be a four-carbon chain. Wait, but acetate is a separate group. Wait, the structure would be:

If it's butenyl acetate, the butenyl group (four carbons with a double bond) is esterified to the acetate. So the structure would be something like CH2=CH-CH2-CO-OCH3? No, wait, acetate is CH3COO-, so the butenyl group would be attached to the carbonyl. For example, if the acetate is OAc-(butenyl). Alternatively, the butenyl group is a substituent on the acetate. Let me clarify:

The general structure of an ester is RCOOR’. If the unknown is butenyl acetate, then the acyl group is acetyl (from acetate), and the ester group is attached to a butenyl group. So the structure would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc? But butenyl is a four-carbon group with a double bond. The position of the double bond can vary. For example, if it's cis-butenyl acetate, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc with the double bond between C2 and C3 (if cis), but depending on configuration. Wait, but butenyl can refer to the double bond between C2 and C3 in a four-carbon chain. So butenyl acetate would have the structure CH2CH=CHCH2-OOC-CH3? Not sure. Maybe I need to approach this differently.

Alternatively, let's look at the NMR signals again. Let's try to match the signals to possible structures.

The 7.0 ppm doublet could be a proton next to a carbonyl group. In an ester, the ester carbonyl could cause deshielding of adjacent protons. If the structure is a trans-butenyl acetate, perhaps the proton at the end of the chain is deshielded. For example, in trans-CH2=CH-CH2-CO-OCH3, the proton on the CH2 at the end (CO-OCH3) might be deshielded and give a signal around 7.0 ppm. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the 7.0 ppm is from the CH group in the double bond.

Wait, in a trans double bond, the adjacent protons could have different neighbors, leading to splitting. Let's consider a structure like CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-OAc. If the double bond is between C2 and C3 (but that would make it a different structure). Wait, maybe this is getting confusing. Let's try specific options.

The choices are:

A) Cis-propenyl acetate

B) Trans-butenyl acetate

C) Cis-butenyl acetate

D) Trans-propenyl acetate

First, propenyl is a three-carbon group, butenyl is four. Let's think about the number of carbons and how that affects the NMR.

For acetate esters, the acetate itself has a carbonyl group (around 1700 cm-1 in IR, but here we have NMR). The 1H NMR of acetate usually has a singlet for the methyl group around 2.1 ppm (which we see here). So that's the CH3 of the acetate.

The other protons in the molecule would be from the propenyl or butenyl group.

Looking at the 7.0 ppm doublet: in a propenyl group (three carbons), if the double bond is between C1 and C2, then the structure is CH2=CH-CH2- and then the acetate is attached somewhere. If attached to the C2, then maybe the structure is CH2=CH-OOC-CH3-CH2? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the propenyl group is CH2=CH-CH2- and the acetate OOC-CH3 is attached to one of these carbons.

Wait, in propenyl acetate, the ester group (acetate) would be attached to one of the carbons in the propenyl chain. For example, if attached to the middle carbon (CH2=CH-CH2-OOC-CH3), but that would be vinyl acetate if the double bond is between C1 and C2. Wait, propenyl is a three-carbon chain with a double bond. So possible structures:

1. CH2=CH-CH2-OOC-CH3 (the acetate is attached to the third carbon, a propenyl group with the double bond between C1 and C2).

2. CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-OOC-CH3? No, that would be butenyl.

Wait, no. Propenyl is three carbons. So structure 1 above is possible. Then, depending on the configuration (cis or trans), the spatial arrangement would differ, but how would that affect the NMR?

In structure 1, CH2=CH-CH2-OOC-CH3, the protons on the CH2 groups would have various environments.

The proton at the end (OOC-CH3) would be next to an oxygen, so likely deshielded. But 7.0 ppm is quite high for a CH2 next to an ester. Maybe there's conjugation.

Alternatively, perhaps the 7.0 ppm is a proton in the double bond. Wait, in a conjugated system. For example, if the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OOC-CH3, the CH2=CH- group has protons. The CH2= would have two protons (trans or cis). If in the trans configuration, the protons on the double bond could be deshielded. Wait, but typically, vinyl protons are around 5-6 ppm. A shift to 7.0 might indicate electron withdrawal, like an adjacent carbonyl. But in this case, the ester is a few carbons away. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the acetate is attached directly to the double bond. For example, OOC-CH2-CH=CH2. In this structure, the double bond is between C2 and C3, and the acetate is on C2. Then the CH2 next to the ester would have protons deshielded. Let's see:

If the structure is OOC-CH2-CH=CH2, that would be similar to allyl acetate. The CH2 next to the ester would have protons that are allylic (next to the double bond), which could lead to coupling with the double bond protons. But in this case, the CH=CH2 group's protons would be around 5 ppm, and the CH2 adjacent to the ester might be around 4-5 ppm. The 7.0 ppm signal doesn't fit here.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is trans-butenyl acetate. Let's consider that. If it's butenyl (four carbons), say CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-OOC-CH3 (trans configuration). In this structure, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the CH2-CH2-OOC-CH3 is the remaining carbons. The proton at the end (CH2-OOC-CH3) might be shifted upfield or downfield. Alternatively, maybe the CH2=CH group's protons would be around 5-6 ppm. The 5.5 ppm dq signal could be an allylic proton. For example, the CH2 next to the double bond (in trans configuration) could have protons that are deshielded and coupled to both protons in the double bond.

Wait, let's model a possible structure. Let's say it's trans-butenyl acetate: CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-OOC-CH3. The double bond is between C1 and C2 (trans). The protons on C2 (CH2=) would be next to the double bond and adjacent to the CH2 chain. The CH2-CH2-OOC-CH3 would have protons further down the chain. The acetate is at the end.

In this case, the protons on the CH2= (trans to each other) would be around 5-6 ppm. The CH2 next to them (CH2-CH2-OOC-) might have protons integrated around 1.5-2.0 ppm. The CH3 of the acetate would be a singlet at ~2.1 ppm.

But where would the 7.0 ppm signal come from? That seems too high for this structure. Maybe another arrangement.

Alternatively, if the acetate is attached directly to the double bond. For example, CH2=CH-CH2-OOC-CH3. In this structure, the CH2=CH- has protons, the CH2-OOC- is next. The OOC-CH3 would deshield the protons next to it. The CH2=CH might have protons around 5-6 ppm. The CH2-OOC-CH3 protons might be upfield or downfield.

Alternatively, maybe there's a conjugated system. If the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OOC-CH3, the CH2-OOC-CH3 group's protons would be next to an ester, which could cause deshielding. But how would that affect the shift?

Alternatively, the 7.0 ppm doublet could be from the CH2= group in a trans configuration. If the trans double bond has protons that are more deshielded due to electron withdrawal from the adjacent group. For example, if the acetate is attached in such a way that the carbonyl is conjugated with the double bond, causing the protons to be shifted downfield (higher ppm). But I'm not sure about conjugation here.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a trans-propenyl acetate. Propenyl is three carbons, so the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-OOC-CH3. If it's trans, but with three carbons, so the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the acetate is attached to C3. Then, the CH2-OOC-CH3 would have protons next to the ester. Let's imagine the structure:

CH2=CH-CH2-OOC-CH3 (trans configuration). In this case, the CH2=CH protons would be around 5-6 ppm. The CH2-OOC-CH3 protons would be next to the ester, causing some deshielding, perhaps up to 7.0 ppm. The dq at 5.5 ppm could be from a proton next to the double bond. Let me think.

In the structure CH2=CH-CH2-OOC-CH3 (trans), the protons on the CH2= are adjacent to the double bond and would likely be split as a doublet due to coupling with each other. Then, the CH2 in the middle (between double bond and ester) would have protons that are split due to coupling with adjacent protons. The CH2-OOC-CH3 group's protons would be next to the ester and might have a singlet (if no adjacent protons) or a multiplet. Wait, but in this structure, the CH2-OOC-CH3 would have two protons, each coupled to the two protons in the adjacent CH2 (from the middle). So maybe a quartet. But I need to draw this out.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's look at the possible answer choices and see which structure would fit the NMR data.

Option B: Trans-butenyl acetate. If butenyl is four carbons, then the structure would be something like CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-OOC-CH3. In a trans configuration, the double bond would have the CH2 groups on either side. The acetate is at the end. The protons on the CH2 next to the double bond could be around 5.5 ppm (dq), and the CH2 next to the ester (CH2-OOC-CH3) might have protons at 7.0 ppm (doublet), but that seems high. Alternatively, maybe the trans configuration leads to more deshielding.

Alternatively, if the acetate is attached to one of the double bond carbons. For example, CH2=CH-CH2-OOC-CH3. But this is a propenyl group, not butenyl. Therefore, option B is trans-butenyl, so the structure would need to have four carbons. For example, CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-OOC-CH3 (trans). In this structure, the CH2=CH- protons would be around 5-6 ppm. The CH2-CH2-OOC-CH3 part would have protons in the 1-2 ppm range. The acetate methyl is at 2.1. So where would 7.0 and 5.5 ppm come from? Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the key is the splitting patterns. The 5.5 ppm signal is a doublet of quartets (dq), which implies coupling with two different neighbors. This is often seen for allylic protons. Allylic protons (next to a double bond) couple with both ends of the double bond, leading to a dq or similar multiplet.

If the compound is trans-butenyl acetate, say (E)-CH2=CHCH2CH2OOCCH3, then the protons on the CH2 next to the double bond (the third carbon) would couple with the protons on the CH2= (first carbon) and the next CH2 ( fifth carbon, which is part of the acetate). But that might not lead to a dq.

Alternatively, if the structure is (E)-CH2=CH-OOC-CH2-CH3. Wait, but this would be a divinyl acetate or something similar. The acetate is attached directly to the double bond. Then, the CH2=CH-OOC- groups would have protons that are deshielded. The CH2 next to the ester (CH2-CH2-OOC-) would have protons that could be split as a dq. Alternatively, the CH2=CH group's protons could be the doublet at 7.0 ppm, and the allylic protons (next to the double bond) at 5.5 ppm.

Wait, if the structure is (E)-CH2=CH-OOC-CH2-CH3, then the CH2= has protons that would be adjacent to the ester, causing them to be deshielded to around 7.0 ppm (doublet). The CH-OOC-CH2-CH3 group would have the CH next to the ester, whose protons could be a dq at 5.5 ppm. The CH3 at the end would be a singlet at 2.1 ppm (but that's the acetate's methyl). Wait, the acetate is OOC-CH2-CH3. So the acetate's methyl would be a singlet at around 2.1 ppm, which matches the given data.

In this structure, (E)-CH2=CH-OOC-CH2-CH3:

- The CH3 would be a singlet at ~2.1 ppm.

- The CH2=CH protons would be a doublet at ~7.0 ppm, coupling with each other.

- The CH-OOC-CH2-CH3 would have the CH2 next to the ester. These protons would be deshielded and could appear around 5.5 ppm. If they are allylic (next to a double bond), they would couple with the double bond protons, leading to a dq.

So, if the CH2 next to the ester is adjacent to the double bond, its protons would be split as a dq due to coupling with both sides of the double bond. This would fit the 5.5 ppm dq. The CH2=CH protons would be a doublet at 7.0 ppm. This structure would be (E)-CH2=CH-OOC-CH2-CH3, which is trans-2-butenyl acetate? Not sure about the numbering.

But in this case, the structure would have the double bond between C1 and C2, and the ester group attached to C2. However, I'm not certain about the exact structure. But assuming such a structure, the NMR data would fit.

Alternatively, if the structure is (E)-CH2=CHCH2OOCCH2CH3, but this would be a different structure with the ester group on the third carbon, which might not lead to the same NMR.

Given the options, B is trans-butenyl acetate, which would align with this proposed structure. Therefore, the answer would be B.

But let's check the other options.

Option A: Cis-propenyl acetate. If it's cis, the structure would have adjacent groups that could deshield protons. For example, CH2=CH-CH2-OOC-CH3 (cis). However, in cis configuration, the ester group and perhaps other groups are on the same side, which could lead to different shielding. But how would that produce the signals? The 7.0 ppm doublet could be from a proton next to the ester, but in cis, there might be more splitting due to coupling with neighboring protons.

Option D: Trans-propenyl acetate. This would be similar to the earlier example, say CH2=CH-CH2-OOC-CH3 in trans configuration. In this case, the CH2=CH protons would be a doublet around 7.0 ppm, and the CH2 next to the ester would have protons that could be a dq at 5.5 ppm. This structure would fit the data as well. However, the question is about propenyl vs butenyl.

The problem states butenyl is four carbons, propenyl is three. However, in option D, propenyl is three carbons. So the ester would be on a three-carbon chain. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-OOC-CH3 (assuming the acetate is on a different carbon). But if propenyl is three carbons and the acetate is attached, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OOC-CH3, which is actually butyl? Wait, no. Propenyl is a three-carbon chain with a double bond. So CH2=CH-CH2- is a propenyl group. Attaching acetate to the end would make it CH2=CH-CH2-OOC-CH3. This is correct. So this would be a three-carbon propenyl group with acetate attached. In trans configuration, the CH2=CH would have their protons as a doublet at 7.0 ppm, and the CH2-OOC-CH3 group's protons might be split as a dq at 5.5 ppm. But wait, the CH2-OOC-CH3 would have protons attached. Each CH2 group adjacent would have protons. For example, in the structure CH2=CH-CH2-OOC-CH3 (trans), the CH2=CH- would have protons as a doublet at 7.0 ppm. The CH2-OOC-CH3 group would have two CH2 groups: the CH2 between the double bond and the ester, and the OOC-CH2-CH3. Wait, the ester is OOC-CH3. Therefore, the chain is CH2=CH-CH2-OOCH3? No, that wouldn't be correct. The correct structure for propenyl acetate would be CH2=CH-CH2-CO-OCH3, but that's vinyl acetate if it's CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. Hmm, perhaps I'm confused here.

Alternatively, maybe the propenyl group is CH2=CH-CH2- and the acetate is attached via an ester linkage to the propenyl group. For example, CH2=CH-CH2-O-CO-CH2-CH3, but that's not acetate. Acetate is O-CO-CH2-CH3. Wait, no. Acetate is the CH3COO- group. So if the propenyl group is esterified to the carbonyl carbon. For example, the structure would be:

If the propenyl group is CH2=CH-CH2- and the acetate is attached to the third carbon, then the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-OOC-CH3. But that's CH2=CH-CH2-COOCH3, which is propyl acetate. But the acetate is CH3COO-, so perhaps the correct structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-OCH2-CO-CH3? No, that's not correct. Maybe the confusion is arising from the structure. Let me clarify:

Acyl groups are in the form RCO-, and the ester is formed by linking the acyl group to an OR' group. So, for acetate, the acyl group is acetyl (CH3CO-) and the ester is formed by attaching it to an alcohol. If the propenyl group is the alcohol, then the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-O-CH2-CO-CH3? No, that's not correct. Alternatively, if the ester is between the acetyl group and the propenyl alcohol, then it would be CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2. This would be acetyl propenyl ester. In this case, the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2. If it's trans, the double bond is between the second and third carbons (CH2=CH-CH2-O-CH2COOCH3). Hmm, this is getting too complicated.

Given that the problem might not require knowing the exact structure, but rather understanding the NMR signals.

The key points are:

- A singlet at 2.1 ppm, which is the acetate methyl group.

- A doublet at 7.0 ppm, likely a proton next to a conjugated system or near the ester group.

- A dq at 5.5 ppm, which is likely an allylic proton (next to a double bond).

If the compound is trans-butenyl acetate, meaning a four-carbon chain with a double bond and the acetate group at the end, then the structure would allow for an allylic proton (CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-OOC-CH3), where the CH2 next to the double bond has protons that are allylic and would give a dq signal. The trans configuration would keep the groups opposed, possibly deshielding the terminal proton to give the 7.0 ppm signal.

Alternatively, if the compound is (E)-CH2=CH-OOC-CH2-CH3, which would be a butenyl acetate (since the chain from the ester would be four carbons: CH2=CH-OOC-CH2-CH3, but that's a four-carbon chain starting from the double bond), then this would fit option B.

Given that, and since the options specify propenyl (three carbons) or butenyl (four carbons), and given the signals, the butenyl (four carbons) with trans configuration would better explain the allylic proton signal (5.5 ppm dq) and the more distant proton at 7.0 ppm. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{B}.
</Think>

Answer: To solve this problem, we need to determine the structure of the compound based on the given NMR signals. The key signals are a singlet at 2.1 ppm, a doublet at 7.0 ppm, and a doublet of quartets (dq) at 5.5 ppm. 

1. **Identifying the Acetate Methyl Group**:
   - The singlet at 2.1 ppm is characteristic of the methyl group (CH3) in the acetate ester (CH3COO-). This confirms the presence of an acetate group in the compound.

2. **Analyzing the Doublet at 7.0 ppm**:
   - This signal is likely from a proton adjacent to a conjugated system or near the ester group. In a trans configuration, protons on a double bond can be deshielded, leading to higher ppm values. 

3. **Analyzing the dq at 5.5 ppm**:
   - A doublet of quartets is typical for an allylic proton (a proton adjacent to a double bond). This suggests the presence of a double bond in the structure, with the neighboring proton coupling to both ends of the double bond.

4. **Considering the Structures**:
   - **Propenyl (three carbons)** vs. **Butenyl (four carbons)**: The dq signal at 5.5 ppm is consistent with an allylic proton in a four-carbon chain (butenyl) rather than a three-carbon chain (propenyl). In a four-carbon chain, the trans configuration allows for a proton distant enough to experience a higher chemical shift (7.0 ppm) due to conjugation or electron withdrawal effects.

5. **Evaluating the Options**:
   - **Option A (Cis-propenyl acetate)**: Cis configuration would not provide the necessary distance for a 7.0 ppm signal, and a three-carbon chain is less likely to produce the dq signal.
   - **Option B (Trans-butenyl acetate)**: A four-carbon chain with trans configuration explains the allylic proton (5.5 ppm dq) and the more distant proton (7.0 ppm doublet).
   - **Option C (Cis-butenyl acetate)**: Cis configuration would not provide the required spatial arrangement for the observed chemical shifts.
   - **Option D (Trans-propenyl acetate)**: A three-carbon chain is less likely to produce the specific dq signal observed.

After careful consideration of the NMR data and the structural implications, the most plausible structure is trans-butenyl acetate (Option B), which aligns with the given signals.

okay, let's tackle this nmr problem. i need to identify the unknown compound based on the given 1h nmr data. the options are between cis-propenyl acetate, trans-propenyl acetate, cis-butenyl acetate, or trans-butenyl acetate. the nmr data provided is:

7.0 ppm (1h, doublet, j = 16.0 hz)
5.5 ppm (1h, doublet of quartets)
2.1 ppm (3h, singlet)
1.6 ppm (3h, doublet)

first, let me recall what each type of acetate would look like structurally. acetate is a common group, ch3coo-, so the structure should have a ester group. the difference between propenyl and butenyl is the number of carbons: propenyl would have a 3-carbon chain with a double bond, and butenyl would have a 4-carbon chain with a double bond. the cis and trans refer to the configuration around the double bond, whether the substituents are on the same side (cis) or opposite sides (trans).

looking at the nmr peaks, let's start with the downfield region. the 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with a coupling constant of 16.0 hz. high chemical shifts around 7.0 ppm usually indicate a proton near an electron-withdrawing group, like an ester. the doublet suggests it's coupled only to one other proton. a coupling constant of 16 hz is typical for a vinyl proton; the c=c double bond causes coupling between adjacent protons. so this likely belongs to a double bond.

next, the 5.5 ppm peak is a doublet of quartets (dq). this chemical shift is also in the aromatic/allylic region. a doublet of quartets implies coupling with two different neighboring protons. let's think about the possible structures. if there's a double bond, the protons adjacent to the carbonyl group in the ester might show coupling with each other and possibly with other protons.

the 2.1 ppm singlet integrating for 3h must be a methyl group (ch3) that's likely attached to an electronegative atom, like oxygen in the acetate. the singlet tells us it's not adjacent to any other protons, so it's probably at the end of a chain, maybe the acetate's methyl group.

then the 1.6 ppm doublet for 3h. a doublet usually means coupling with one other proton. this could be a methyl group attached to a carbon that's next to another proton. alternatively, maybe a ch3 group attached to a carbon adjacent to the double bond.

let me try to piece this together. let's consider the structures of propenyl and butenyl acetates.

starting with propenyl acetate: structure would be ch2=ch-ch2-oac (maybe). wait, no. actually, propenyl acetate would be more like ch2=chcooch3, but wait, no. wait, acetate is ch3coo- attached to a propenyl group (which is a 3-carbon chain with a double bond). let me draw it out.

propenyl group is ch2=ch-ch2-; attaching acetate to that. so possible structures:

1. ch2=ch-ch2-oac (all trans)
2. ch2=chcooch3? wait, no. wait, acetate is ch3coo-, so if it's propenyl acetate, the propenyl group is attached to the carbonyl. wait, maybe i'm confused here. let's clarify.

the structure of propenyl acetate should be ch2=ch-ch2-co-och3? no, wait, no. wait, acetate is ch3coo-; the propenyl group would be a substituent on the ester. so perhaps the structure is oac-ch2-ch=ch2? or oac-c(ch3)=ch2? hmm.

alternatively, perhaps the acetate is attached to one end of the propenyl group. so the propenyl acetate would have the structure ch2=ch-ch2-oac. then, depending on the configuration, the double bond could be between c1 and c2 (if it's propenyl), so for trans, the groups would be opposite, and cis would have them on the same side. wait, but propenyl group is three carbons with a double bond. so possible structures:

propenyl acetate: the double bond could be between c1 and c2 (ch2=ch-ch2-oac) or between c2 and c3 (ch2-ch=ch-oac). but perhaps the acetate is on the end. hmm, maybe i need to think in another way.

alternatively, butenyl acetate would have a four-carbon chain. for example, ch2=ch-ch2-ch2-oac (but that would be butenyl), but depending on the position of the double bond. butenyl would have the double bond between c2 and c3 in something like ch2=chch2ch2-oac, but butenyl can have double bonds in different positions (like between c1-c2 or c2-c3). but given the options are cis or trans butenyl or propenyl, maybe the butenyl is between c2 and c3 of a four-carbon chain.

but maybe the key is in the nmr data. let's look at the splitting patterns.

the 7.0 ppm signal is a doublet (j=16 hz). since coupling constants over 10 hz are typical for vinyl protons (adjacent protons on a double bond), this suggests that the proton in question is part of a double bond. the fact that it's a doublet means it's coupled only to one other proton. so this proton has one adjacent proton on the double bond. that would mean the double bond is at the end of a chain, so that there's only one neighboring proton. for example, if the structure is ch2=ch-ch2-oac, the proton at the end (ch2-oac) would be a doublet because it's only coupled to the ch proton. wait, but maybe the 7.0 ppm is the ch proton in ch2=ch-?

wait, in the structure ch2=ch-ch2-oac, the double bond is between positions 1 and 2. the ch2 group attached to oxygen would be next. the protons on the double bond would have coupling. let me break it down.

in such a structure, the ch2 group next to the ester would be -ch2-oac. the ch group in the double bond would be ch2=ch-; each ch in the double bond has two protons. wait, no. for ch2=ch-ch2-oac, the double bond is between c1 and c2. the c2 (ch2=ch-) has two protons, and the c1 (ch2=) also has two protons. then c3 is ch2-oac, with two protons. but the oac is -o-ch2-co-.

but maybe i need to consider coupling between the protons in the double bond. wait, in a trans-configuration, the protons on the double bond are equivalent if the substituents are the same. hmm, but if the substituents are different (like one side has a ch2-oac group and the other is hydrogen), then the protons may not be equivalent.

alternatively, if the structure is something like ch2=chcooch3 (acrylic acid methyl ester?), but acetate is ch3coo-, so that would be different.

wait, the problem is about propenyl or butenyl acetate. let's think about propenyl acetate. the propenyl group is a three-carbon chain with a double bond. if the acetate is attached to one end, then the structure would be ch2=ch-ch2-oac (if the double bond is between c1 and c2), or ch2-ch=ch-oac (double bond between c2 and c3). the position of the double bond can affect the nmr.

similarly, butenyl acetate would have a four-carbon chain. the double bond position would again affect the splitting.

given the nmr data:

- 7.0 ppm, doublet, j=16 hz: this is likely a proton adjacent to an ester group, probably in a conjugated system. but 7.0 ppm is a bit low for a benzene ring, so more likely an ester or possibly a conjugated double bond.

- 5.5 ppm, dq: this signal is downfield of the 7.0 ppm, which is unusual unless there are electron-withdrawing groups. alternatively, maybe this is an allylic proton. allylic protons (next to a double bond) can have splitting patterns based on coupling with adjacent protons.

let me think about possible structures. suppose we have a butenyl acetate. let's consider cis vs. trans. for example, if the butenyl group is ch2=ch-ch2-ch2- and the acetate is attached to the end, but that would be a four-carbon chain. wait, but acetate is a separate group. wait, the structure would be:

if it's butenyl acetate, the butenyl group (four carbons with a double bond) is esterified to the acetate. so the structure would be something like ch2=ch-ch2-co-och3? no, wait, acetate is ch3coo-, so the butenyl group would be attached to the carbonyl. for example, if the acetate is oac-(butenyl). alternatively, the butenyl group is a substituent on the acetate. let me clarify:

the general structure of an ester is rcoor’. if the unknown is butenyl acetate, then the acyl group is acetyl (from acetate), and the ester group is attached to a butenyl group. so the structure would be ch2=chch2ch2-oac? but butenyl is a four-carbon group with a double bond. the position of the double bond can vary. for example, if it's cis-butenyl acetate, perhaps the structure is ch2=chch2ch2-oac with the double bond between c2 and c3 (if cis), but depending on configuration. wait, but butenyl can refer to the double bond between c2 and c3 in a four-carbon chain. so butenyl acetate would have the structure ch2ch=chch2-ooc-ch3? not sure. maybe i need to approach this differently.

alternatively, let's look at the nmr signals again. let's try to match the signals to possible structures.

the 7.0 ppm doublet could be a proton next to a carbonyl group. in an ester, the ester carbonyl could cause deshielding of adjacent protons. if the structure is a trans-butenyl acetate, perhaps the proton at the end of the chain is deshielded. for example, in trans-ch2=ch-ch2-co-och3, the proton on the ch2 at the end (co-och3) might be deshielded and give a signal around 7.0 ppm. but i'm not sure. alternatively, maybe the 7.0 ppm is from the ch group in the double bond.

wait, in a trans double bond, the adjacent protons could have different neighbors, leading to splitting. let's consider a structure like ch2=ch-ch2-ch2-oac. if the double bond is between c2 and c3 (but that would make it a different structure). wait, maybe this is getting confusing. let's try specific options.

the choices are:

a) cis-propenyl acetate

b) trans-butenyl acetate

c) cis-butenyl acetate

d) trans-propenyl acetate

first, propenyl is a three-carbon group, butenyl is four. let's think about the number of carbons and how that affects the nmr.

for acetate esters, the acetate itself has a carbonyl group (around 1700 cm-1 in ir, but here we have nmr). the 1h nmr of acetate usually has a singlet for the methyl group around 2.1 ppm (which we see here). so that's the ch3 of the acetate.

the other protons in the molecule would be from the propenyl or butenyl group.

looking at the 7.0 ppm doublet: in a propenyl group (three carbons), if the double bond is between c1 and c2, then the structure is ch2=ch-ch2- and then the acetate is attached somewhere. if attached to the c2, then maybe the structure is ch2=ch-ooc-ch3-ch2? no, that doesn't make sense. wait, maybe the propenyl group is ch2=ch-ch2- and the acetate ooc-ch3 is attached to one of these carbons.

wait, in propenyl acetate, the ester group (acetate) would be attached to one of the carbons in the propenyl chain. for example, if attached to the middle carbon (ch2=ch-ch2-ooc-ch3), but that would be vinyl acetate if the double bond is between c1 and c2. wait, propenyl is a three-carbon chain with a double bond. so possible structures:

1. ch2=ch-ch2-ooc-ch3 (the acetate is attached to the third carbon, a propenyl group with the double bond between c1 and c2).

2. ch2=ch-ch2-ch2-ooc-ch3? no, that would be butenyl.

wait, no. propenyl is three carbons. so structure 1 above is possible. then, depending on the configuration (cis or trans), the spatial arrangement would differ, but how would that affect the nmr?

in structure 1, ch2=ch-ch2-ooc-ch3, the protons on the ch2 groups would have various environments.

the proton at the end (ooc-ch3) would be next to an oxygen, so likely deshielded. but 7.0 ppm is quite high for a ch2 next to an ester. maybe there's conjugation.

alternatively, perhaps the 7.0 ppm is a proton in the double bond. wait, in a conjugated system. for example, if the structure is ch2=ch-ch2-ooc-ch3, the ch2=ch- group has protons. the ch2= would have two protons (trans or cis). if in the trans configuration, the protons on the double bond could be deshielded. wait, but typically, vinyl protons are around 5-6 ppm. a shift to 7.0 might indicate electron withdrawal, like an adjacent carbonyl. but in this case, the ester is a few carbons away. hmm.

alternatively, maybe the acetate is attached directly to the double bond. for example, ooc-ch2-ch=ch2. in this structure, the double bond is between c2 and c3, and the acetate is on c2. then the ch2 next to the ester would have protons deshielded. let's see:

if the structure is ooc-ch2-ch=ch2, that would be similar to allyl acetate. the ch2 next to the ester would have protons that are allylic (next to the double bond), which could lead to coupling with the double bond protons. but in this case, the ch=ch2 group's protons would be around 5 ppm, and the ch2 adjacent to the ester might be around 4-5 ppm. the 7.0 ppm signal doesn't fit here.

alternatively, maybe the compound is trans-butenyl acetate. let's consider that. if it's butenyl (four carbons), say ch2=ch-ch2-ch2-ooc-ch3 (trans configuration). in this structure, the double bond is between c1 and c2, and the ch2-ch2-ooc-ch3 is the remaining carbons. the proton at the end (ch2-ooc-ch3) might be shifted upfield or downfield. alternatively, maybe the ch2=ch group's protons would be around 5-6 ppm. the 5.5 ppm dq signal could be an allylic proton. for example, the ch2 next to the double bond (in trans configuration) could have protons that are deshielded and coupled to both protons in the double bond.

wait, let's model a possible structure. let's say it's trans-butenyl acetate: ch2=ch-ch2-ch2-ooc-ch3. the double bond is between c1 and c2 (trans). the protons on c2 (ch2=) would be next to the double bond and adjacent to the ch2 chain. the ch2-ch2-ooc-ch3 would have protons further down the chain. the acetate is at the end.

in this case, the protons on the ch2= (trans to each other) would be around 5-6 ppm. the ch2 next to them (ch2-ch2-ooc-) might have protons integrated around 1.5-2.0 ppm. the ch3 of the acetate would be a singlet at ~2.1 ppm.

but where would the 7.0 ppm signal come from? that seems too high for this structure. maybe another arrangement.

alternatively, if the acetate is attached directly to the double bond. for example, ch2=ch-ch2-ooc-ch3. in this structure, the ch2=ch- has protons, the ch2-ooc- is next. the ooc-ch3 would deshield the protons next to it. the ch2=ch might have protons around 5-6 ppm. the ch2-ooc-ch3 protons might be upfield or downfield.

alternatively, maybe there's a conjugated system. if the structure is ch2=ch-ch2-ooc-ch3, the ch2-ooc-ch3 group's protons would be next to an ester, which could cause deshielding. but how would that affect the shift?

alternatively, the 7.0 ppm doublet could be from the ch2= group in a trans configuration. if the trans double bond has protons that are more deshielded due to electron withdrawal from the adjacent group. for example, if the acetate is attached in such a way that the carbonyl is conjugated with the double bond, causing the protons to be shifted downfield (higher ppm). but i'm not sure about conjugation here.

alternatively, perhaps the compound is a trans-propenyl acetate. propenyl is three carbons, so the structure would be ch2=ch-ch2-ooc-ch3. if it's trans, but with three carbons, so the double bond is between c1 and c2, and the acetate is attached to c3. then, the ch2-ooc-ch3 would have protons next to the ester. let's imagine the structure:

ch2=ch-ch2-ooc-ch3 (trans configuration). in this case, the ch2=ch protons would be around 5-6 ppm. the ch2-ooc-ch3 protons would be next to the ester, causing some deshielding, perhaps up to 7.0 ppm. the dq at 5.5 ppm could be from a proton next to the double bond. let me think.

in the structure ch2=ch-ch2-ooc-ch3 (trans), the protons on the ch2= are adjacent to the double bond and would likely be split as a doublet due to coupling with each other. then, the ch2 in the middle (between double bond and ester) would have protons that are split due to coupling with adjacent protons. the ch2-ooc-ch3 group's protons would be next to the ester and might have a singlet (if no adjacent protons) or a multiplet. wait, but in this structure, the ch2-ooc-ch3 would have two protons, each coupled to the two protons in the adjacent ch2 (from the middle). so maybe a quartet. but i need to draw this out.

alternatively, maybe i'm overcomplicating. let's look at the possible answer choices and see which structure would fit the nmr data.

option b: trans-butenyl acetate. if butenyl is four carbons, then the structure would be something like ch2=ch-ch2-ch2-ooc-ch3. in a trans configuration, the double bond would have the ch2 groups on either side. the acetate is at the end. the protons on the ch2 next to the double bond could be around 5.5 ppm (dq), and the ch2 next to the ester (ch2-ooc-ch3) might have protons at 7.0 ppm (doublet), but that seems high. alternatively, maybe the trans configuration leads to more deshielding.

alternatively, if the acetate is attached to one of the double bond carbons. for example, ch2=ch-ch2-ooc-ch3. but this is a propenyl group, not butenyl. therefore, option b is trans-butenyl, so the structure would need to have four carbons. for example, ch2=ch-ch2-ch2-ooc-ch3 (trans). in this structure, the ch2=ch- protons would be around 5-6 ppm. the ch2-ch2-ooc-ch3 part would have protons in the 1-2 ppm range. the acetate methyl is at 2.1. so where would 7.0 and 5.5 ppm come from? maybe i'm missing something.

wait, maybe the key is the splitting patterns. the 5.5 ppm signal is a doublet of quartets (dq), which implies coupling with two different neighbors. this is often seen for allylic protons. allylic protons (next to a double bond) couple with both ends of the double bond, leading to a dq or similar multiplet.

if the compound is trans-butenyl acetate, say (e)-ch2=chch2ch2oocch3, then the protons on the ch2 next to the double bond (the third carbon) would couple with the protons on the ch2= (first carbon) and the next ch2 ( fifth carbon, which is part of the acetate). but that might not lead to a dq.

alternatively, if the structure is (e)-ch2=ch-ooc-ch2-ch3. wait, but this would be a divinyl acetate or something similar. the acetate is attached directly to the double bond. then, the ch2=ch-ooc- groups would have protons that are deshielded. the ch2 next to the ester (ch2-ch2-ooc-) would have protons that could be split as a dq. alternatively, the ch2=ch group's protons could be the doublet at 7.0 ppm, and the allylic protons (next to the double bond) at 5.5 ppm.

wait, if the structure is (e)-ch2=ch-ooc-ch2-ch3, then the ch2= has protons that would be adjacent to the ester, causing them to be deshielded to around 7.0 ppm (doublet). the ch-ooc-ch2-ch3 group would have the ch next to the ester, whose protons could be a dq at 5.5 ppm. the ch3 at the end would be a singlet at 2.1 ppm (but that's the acetate's methyl). wait, the acetate is ooc-ch2-ch3. so the acetate's methyl would be a singlet at around 2.1 ppm, which matches the given data.

in this structure, (e)-ch2=ch-ooc-ch2-ch3:

- the ch3 would be a singlet at ~2.1 ppm.

- the ch2=ch protons would be a doublet at ~7.0 ppm, coupling with each other.

- the ch-ooc-ch2-ch3 would have the ch2 next to the ester. these protons would be deshielded and could appear around 5.5 ppm. if they are allylic (next to a double bond), they would couple with the double bond protons, leading to a dq.

so, if the ch2 next to the ester is adjacent to the double bond, its protons would be split as a dq due to coupling with both sides of the double bond. this would fit the 5.5 ppm dq. the ch2=ch protons would be a doublet at 7.0 ppm. this structure would be (e)-ch2=ch-ooc-ch2-ch3, which is trans-2-butenyl acetate? not sure about the numbering.

but in this case, the structure would have the double bond between c1 and c2, and the ester group attached to c2. however, i'm not certain about the exact structure. but assuming such a structure, the nmr data would fit.

alternatively, if the structure is (e)-ch2=chch2oocch2ch3, but this would be a different structure with the ester group on the third carbon, which might not lead to the same nmr.

given the options, b is trans-butenyl acetate, which would align with this proposed structure. therefore, the answer would be b.

but let's check the other options.

option a: cis-propenyl acetate. if it's cis, the structure would have adjacent groups that could deshield protons. for example, ch2=ch-ch2-ooc-ch3 (cis). however, in cis configuration, the ester group and perhaps other groups are on the same side, which could lead to different shielding. but how would that produce the signals? the 7.0 ppm doublet could be from a proton next to the ester, but in cis, there might be more splitting due to coupling with neighboring protons.

option d: trans-propenyl acetate. this would be similar to the earlier example, say ch2=ch-ch2-ooc-ch3 in trans configuration. in this case, the ch2=ch protons would be a doublet around 7.0 ppm, and the ch2 next to the ester would have protons that could be a dq at 5.5 ppm. this structure would fit the data as well. however, the question is about propenyl vs butenyl.

the problem states butenyl is four carbons, propenyl is three. however, in option d, propenyl is three carbons. so the ester would be on a three-carbon chain. so the structure would be ch2=ch-ch2-ooc-ch3 (assuming the acetate is on a different carbon). but if propenyl is three carbons and the acetate is attached, perhaps the structure is ch2=ch-ch2-ooc-ch3, which is actually butyl? wait, no. propenyl is a three-carbon chain with a double bond. so ch2=ch-ch2- is a propenyl group. attaching acetate to the end would make it ch2=ch-ch2-ooc-ch3. this is correct. so this would be a three-carbon propenyl group with acetate attached. in trans configuration, the ch2=ch would have their protons as a doublet at 7.0 ppm, and the ch2-ooc-ch3 group's protons might be split as a dq at 5.5 ppm. but wait, the ch2-ooc-ch3 would have protons attached. each ch2 group adjacent would have protons. for example, in the structure ch2=ch-ch2-ooc-ch3 (trans), the ch2=ch- would have protons as a doublet at 7.0 ppm. the ch2-ooc-ch3 group would have two ch2 groups: the ch2 between the double bond and the ester, and the ooc-ch2-ch3. wait, the ester is ooc-ch3. therefore, the chain is ch2=ch-ch2-ooch3? no, that wouldn't be correct. the correct structure for propenyl acetate would be ch2=ch-ch2-co-och3, but that's vinyl acetate if it's ch2=ch-co-och3. hmm, perhaps i'm confused here.

alternatively, maybe the propenyl group is ch2=ch-ch2- and the acetate is attached via an ester linkage to the propenyl group. for example, ch2=ch-ch2-o-co-ch2-ch3, but that's not acetate. acetate is o-co-ch2-ch3. wait, no. acetate is the ch3coo- group. so if the propenyl group is esterified to the carbonyl carbon. for example, the structure would be:

if the propenyl group is ch2=ch-ch2- and the acetate is attached to the third carbon, then the structure would be ch2=ch-ch2-ooc-ch3. but that's ch2=ch-ch2-cooch3, which is propyl acetate. but the acetate is ch3coo-, so perhaps the correct structure would be ch2=ch-ch2-och2-co-ch3? no, that's not correct. maybe the confusion is arising from the structure. let me clarify:

acyl groups are in the form rco-, and the ester is formed by linking the acyl group to an or' group. so, for acetate, the acyl group is acetyl (ch3co-) and the ester is formed by attaching it to an alcohol. if the propenyl group is the alcohol, then the structure would be ch2=ch-ch2-o-ch2-co-ch3? no, that's not correct. alternatively, if the ester is between the acetyl group and the propenyl alcohol, then it would be ch3co-o-ch2-ch=ch2. this would be acetyl propenyl ester. in this case, the structure is ch3co-o-ch2-ch=ch2. if it's trans, the double bond is between the second and third carbons (ch2=ch-ch2-o-ch2cooch3). hmm, this is getting too complicated.

given that the problem might not require knowing the exact structure, but rather understanding the nmr signals.

the key points are:

- a singlet at 2.1 ppm, which is the acetate methyl group.

- a doublet at 7.0 ppm, likely a proton next to a conjugated system or near the ester group.

- a dq at 5.5 ppm, which is likely an allylic proton (next to a double bond).

if the compound is trans-butenyl acetate, meaning a four-carbon chain with a double bond and the acetate group at the end, then the structure would allow for an allylic proton (ch2=ch-ch2-ch2-ooc-ch3), where the ch2 next to the double bond has protons that are allylic and would give a dq signal. the trans configuration would keep the groups opposed, possibly deshielding the terminal proton to give the 7.0 ppm signal.

alternatively, if the compound is (e)-ch2=ch-ooc-ch2-ch3, which would be a butenyl acetate (since the chain from the ester would be four carbons: ch2=ch-ooc-ch2-ch3, but that's a four-carbon chain starting from the double bond), then this would fit option b.

given that, and since the options specify propenyl (three carbons) or butenyl (four carbons), and given the signals, the butenyl (four carbons) with trans configuration would better explain the allylic proton signal (5.5 ppm dq) and the more distant proton at 7.0 ppm. therefore, the answer is \boxed{b}.
</think>

answer: to solve this problem, we need to determine the structure of the compound based on the given nmr signals. the key signals are a singlet at 2.1 ppm, a doublet at 7.0 ppm, and a doublet of quartets (dq) at 5.5 ppm. 

1. **identifying the acetate methyl group**:
   - the singlet at 2.1 ppm is characteristic of the methyl group (ch3) in the acetate ester (ch3coo-). this confirms the presence of an acetate group in the compound.

2. **analyzing the doublet at 7.0 ppm**:
   - this signal is likely from a proton adjacent to a conjugated system or near the ester group. in a trans configuration, protons on a double bond can be deshielded, leading to higher ppm values. 

3. **analyzing the dq at 5.5 ppm**:
   - a doublet of quartets is typical for an allylic proton (a proton adjacent to a double bond). this suggests the presence of a double bond in the structure, with the neighboring proton coupling to both ends of the double bond.

4. **considering the structures**:
   - **propenyl (three carbons)** vs. **butenyl (four carbons)**: the dq signal at 5.5 ppm is consistent with an allylic proton in a four-carbon chain (butenyl) rather than a three-carbon chain (propenyl). in a four-carbon chain, the trans configuration allows for a proton distant enough to experience a higher chemical shift (7.0 ppm) due to conjugation or electron withdrawal effects.

5. **evaluating the options**:
   - **option a (cis-propenyl acetate)**: cis configuration would not provide the necessary distance for a 7.0 ppm signal, and a three-carbon chain is less likely to produce the dq signal.
   - **option b (trans-butenyl acetate)**: a four-carbon chain with trans configuration explains the allylic proton (5.5 ppm dq) and the more distant proton (7.0 ppm doublet).
   - **option c (cis-butenyl acetate)**: cis configuration would not provide the required spatial arrangement for the observed chemical shifts.
   - **option d (trans-propenyl acetate)**: a three-carbon chain is less likely to produce the specific dq signal observed.

after careful consideration of the nmr data and the structural implications, the most plausible structure is trans-butenyl acetate (option b), which aligns with the given signals.

\boxed{b}
