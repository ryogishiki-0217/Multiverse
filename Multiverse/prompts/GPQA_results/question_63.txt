Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about a diatomic molecule transitioning from the fundamental state to the next lowest energy state when it absorbs a photon. I need to find the momentum of that photon. Let me try to break this down step by step.
First, the problem mentions the quantum rotation-vibration model, also called the non-rigid rotor model. That means the molecule can both rotate and vibrate, and these motions have quantized energy levels. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which I think would be the ground state for both rotation and vibration. The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the first excited state, but whether that's a vibrational or rotational transition depends on the energy differences. But how do I determine which transition requires less energy here?
The question is asking for the momentum of the photon absorbed when switching to the next lowest energy state. So, the photon energy should match the energy difference between the ground state and the first excited state. But maybe there are two possible transitions: a vibrational one or a rotational one. Which one has a smaller energy gap?
Wait, typically, vibrational energies are higher than rotational energies. For example, in infrared spectroscopy, vibrational transitions are in the infrared region, while rotational transitions are in the microwave region. So, maybe the rotational transitions are lower in energy? But then again, the problem says "fundamental state" – maybe that's the ground state for both rotation and vibration. So the next lowest energy state could be either the first vibrational excited state or the first rotational excited state. Which one has lower energy?
The angular frequency of vibration is given as \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \). Let me recall the energy levels for quantum harmonic oscillator (vibrational) and rigid rotor (rotational).
For a quantum harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are \( E_v = \left(v + \frac{1}{2}\right) \hbar \omega \), where \( v = 0, 1, 2, \ldots \). So the energy difference between the ground state \( v=0 \) and first excited state \( v=1 \) is \( \hbar \omega \).
For a rigid rotor, the energy levels are \( E_J = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I} J(J+1) \), where \( J = 0, 1, 2, \ldots \) and \( I \) is the moment of inertia. The transition from \( J=0 \) to \( J=1 \) would have energy \( \frac{\hbar^2}{2I} (2) = \frac{\hbar^2}{I} \). So the energy of the rotational transition depends on the moment of inertia.
But without knowing the moment of inertia, how can we compare? Hmm, maybe the problem assumes that the vibrational energy is higher? Or perhaps the given \( \omega \) is for vibration, so maybe the vibrational energy difference is \( \hbar \omega \), while the rotational energy difference is smaller? But since they didn't provide the moment of inertia, maybe they only need us to consider the vibrational transition? Or maybe the problem is combining both?
Wait, but the answer choices are given in momentum \( p \), so the photon's momentum. The energy of the photon is \( E = \hbar k \), where \( k \) is the wave number. But momentum is \( p = \hbar k \), so \( E = pc \) for photons in vacuum. Wait, but if the problem is about the momentum transferred to the molecule, maybe it's the recoil momentum? But that's usually a very small effect. Alternatively, maybe they are using the relation \( E = \hbar \omega = pc \), so \( p = \hbar \omega / c \). But wait, the given \( \omega \) is the vibrational frequency? Let me check the units.
Wait, the angular frequency \( \omega \) is given in rad/s. If the photon's energy is \( \hbar \omega \), then the \( \omega \) here would be the angular frequency of the photon. But the problem mentions the molecule's vibration angular frequency. Maybe that's separate. Wait, perhaps this is a vibrational transition, and the photon's energy matches the vibrational energy difference. So the angular frequency \( \omega \) given is that of the vibration, so the energy difference between \( v=0 \) and \( v=1 \) is \( \hbar \omega \). Then the photon's energy is \( \hbar \omega \), so momentum would be \( p = \hbar k \). But for a photon, \( E = \hbar \omega = pc \), so \( p = \hbar \omega / c \). Wait, but do they give the speed of light? Let me check the problem again.
Wait, the problem gives the angular frequency of vibration, \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \). So if the transition is a vibrational one, the energy difference is \( \hbar \omega \). Then, assuming the photon's energy is \( \hbar \omega \), then its momentum is \( p = \hbar \omega / c \). But the answer choices are on the order of \( 10^{-27} \) or \( 10^{-28} \) N·s. Let me check the numbers.
First, let's compute \( \hbar \): \( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \). The speed of light \( c \approx 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). So, substituting in \( p = \hbar \omega / c \):
\( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \).
So:
\( p = (1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}) \times (4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s}) / (3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}) \).
First, multiply numerator:
\( 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \times 4 \times 10^{14} = 4.2182872 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J·s·rad/s} \).
Then divide by \( c \):
\( 4.2182872 \times 10^{-20} / (3 \times 10^8) = 1.4060957 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{J·s/m} \).
But \( 1 \, \text{J·s/m} = 1 \, \text{N·s} \), because \( 1 \, \text{J} = 1 \, \text{N·m} \), so \( 1 \, \text{J·s/m} = 1 \, \text{N·m·s/m} = 1 \, \text{N·s} \).
So the momentum \( p \approx 1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \). Looking at the answer choices, option C is \( 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \). So that's answer C.
But wait, let's check if this is correct. The problem states "the last line of your response should be of the following format: '\boxed{$LETTER}' where LETTER is one of A, B, C, and D." But first, let's verify.
Wait, but why is the energy difference \( \hbar \omega \)? In the quantum harmonic oscillator, the energy difference between adjacent levels (v=0 to v=1) is \( \hbar \omega \). So if the molecule is in the ground state of vibration and it absorbs a photon of energy \( \hbar \omega \), that would excite it to the first vibrational excited state. Therefore, the photon's energy is \( \hbar \omega \), and thus its momentum is \( \hbar \omega / c \). So, given that calculation, 1.4 times 10^-28 N·s, so answer C.
But let's check the calculation again. Maybe I made a mistake in the arithmetic.
Compute numerator:
\( 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \times 4 \times 10^{14} = 1.0545718 \times 4 = 4.2182872 \), exponents: 10^{-34 + 14} = 10^{-20}. So 4.2182872e-20 J·s·rad/s.
Then divide by c, which is 3e8 m/s:
4.2182872e-20 / 3e8 = (4.2182872 / 3) × 10^{-20 - 8} = 1.4060957 × 10^{-28}.
Yes, exactly. So 1.406 × 10^{-28} N·s, which is approximately 1.4 × 10^{-28} N·s, so answer C.
But wait, let's make sure there isn't a different consideration here. For example, maybe they need to account for rotational transitions instead? Let's think: if the transition was a rotational one, we would need the moment of inertia. But since the problem didn't provide the moment of inertia or any rotational constants, maybe we can't calculate the rotational transition energy. Therefore, the only possible calculation is the vibrational transition. So that leads us to answer C.
Alternatively, maybe the question is about the momentum transferred to the molecule upon absorption, rather than the photon's momentum? Wait, no, the question says "the momentum of the photon". If the molecule absorbs a photon, the photon's momentum is p = E/c, where E is the energy. If the transition is E = ħω, then p = ħω/c, which is what we calculated. So this seems correct.
Alternatively, maybe there's an error in assuming the transition is vibrational. Maybe it's a rotational transition? But without the moment of inertia, how would we calculate it? Also, the problem gives the vibration angular frequency, which might imply that the transition is vibrational. So perhaps the correct answer is C.

Answer: To determine the momentum of the photon absorbed by the diatomic molecule, we consider the transition from the fundamental state (ground state) to the next lowest energy state. 

The given angular frequency of vibration is \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \). For a quantum harmonic oscillator, the energy difference between the ground state (\( v = 0 \)) and the first excited state (\( v = 1 \)) is \( \hbar \omega \). 

The energy of the photon is \( \hbar \omega \), and its momentum \( p \) is related to its energy by \( E = pc \). Therefore, the momentum of the photon is calculated as:

\[
p = \frac{\hbar \omega}{c}
\]

Substituting the given values:
- \( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)
- \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \)
- \( c \approx 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)

\[
p = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}) \times (4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s})}{3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}}
\]

Calculating the numerator:
\[
1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \times 4 \times 10^{14} = 4.2182872 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J·s·rad/s}
\]

Dividing by the speed of light:
\[
\frac{4.2182872 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} = 1.4060957 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}
\]

This value approximates to \( 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \), which corresponds to option C.

\[
\boxed{C}
\]

answer: to determine the momentum of the photon absorbed by the diatomic molecule, we consider the transition from the fundamental state (ground state) to the next lowest energy state. 

the given angular frequency of vibration is \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \). for a quantum harmonic oscillator, the energy difference between the ground state (\( v = 0 \)) and the first excited state (\( v = 1 \)) is \( \hbar \omega \). 

the energy of the photon is \( \hbar \omega \), and its momentum \( p \) is related to its energy by \( e = pc \). therefore, the momentum of the photon is calculated as:

\[
p = \frac{\hbar \omega}{c}
\]

substituting the given values:
- \( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{j·s} \)
- \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \)
- \( c \approx 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)

\[
p = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{j·s}) \times (4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s})}{3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}}
\]

calculating the numerator:
\[
1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \times 4 \times 10^{14} = 4.2182872 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{j·s·rad/s}
\]

dividing by the speed of light:
\[
\frac{4.2182872 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} = 1.4060957 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{n·s}
\]

this value approximates to \( 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{n·s} \), which corresponds to option c.
