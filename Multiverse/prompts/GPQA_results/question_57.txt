So first, I need to compute k.
Wait, the electrons are 50 MeV.
Let's make sure I use the correct formula.
Since 50 MeV is pretty energetic, but maybe the non-relativistic approximation is still okay?
The rest mass energy of an electron is about 0.511 MeV, so 50 MeV is more than 100 times that, which suggests relativistic effects might be significant.
However, the problem might expect us to use the non-relativistic formula.
Hmm.
But I need to check.
Wait, in scattering experiments at high energies, even with relativistic particles, the scattering amplitude is often analyzed in terms of non-relativistic formulas for simplicity, unless specifically stated otherwise.
But perhaps the problem gives a hint?
Wait, the answer choices are in femtometers (fm), which is 10^-15 m.
So the answer is expected to be in fm.
Let's proceed with non-relativistic and see.
If my answer is way off, maybe I'll need to adjust.
But let's start with non-relativistic.
So, first, compute the wavelength k.
Electron energy E = 50 MeV.
First, convert E to joules.
1 eV = 1.60218e-19 J.
So 50 MeV = 50 * 1e6 * 1.60218e-19 J = 50 * 1e6 * 1.60218e-19 = 50 * 1.60218e-13 = 8.0109e-12 J.
But maybe it's easier to use electron mass in eV terms.
The rest mass of electron is about 0.511 MeV/c2.
So perhaps better to use the non-relativistic relation E = p2/(2m), so p = sqrt(2mE).
Then, wavelength k = p/ħ.
Let's do that.

Alternatively, in natural units where ħ = 1, so k = p.
But I need to compute k in 1/meters.
Wait, this might be getting complicated.
Let me try step by step.
First, compute the momentum p of a 50 MeV electron.
Since E = 50 MeV, and the electron mass is about 0.511 MeV/c2.
So the total energy squared is E2 = (pc)^2 + (m c2)^2.
Therefore, (pc)^2 = E2 - (m c2)^2.
So pc = sqrt(E2 - m2c^4).
Then, p = (sqrt(E2 - m2c^4))/c.

So, given E = 50 MeV, m = 0.511 MeV/c2.
Therefore, (pc)^2 = (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 = 2500 - 0.261 = 2499.738 (in MeV2/c^4).
Then pc = sqrt(2499.738) MeV/c.
Which is approximately sqrt(2499.738) ≈ 49.997 MeV/c.
So p = (49.997 MeV/c) / c.
Wait, that gives momentum p in MeV/c units.
Hmm.
But I need to convert this into kg m/s.
Wait, perhaps it's easier to keep track in natural units where ħ = 1, c = 1, but maybe I need to compute k in 1/m.
Wait, the definition of k is 2π/λ, where λ is the wavelength.
From de Broglie relation, λ = h/p, so k = 2π p / ħ, since p = ħ k / 2π.
Wait, but with ħ = h/(2π), so k = p / ħ.
So if p is in MeV/c, and ħ has units of J s, then k would have units of 1/m.
But let's compute this step by step.
First, p in MeV/c units: approximately 49.997 MeV/c.
So we need to convert this to kg m/s.
1 MeV = 1e6 eV = 1e6 * 1.60218e-19 J = 1.60218e-13 J.
So p (in kg m/s) = (49.997 MeV/c) * (1.60218e-13 J / (3e8 m/s)).
Wait, because 1 MeV = 1.60218e-13 J, and c = 3e8 m/s.
So, p = 49.997 * 1.60218e-13 / (3e8) kg m/s.
Let's compute that:
49.997 * 1.60218e-13 = 49.997 * 1.60218e-13 ≈ 8.0107e-12 J s/m.
Then divide by c = 3e8 m/s:
p = 8.0107e-12 / 3e8 ≈ 2.6702e-20 kg m/s.
Now, k = p / ħ.
ħ is approximately 1.05457e-34 J s.
So k = 2.6702e-20 kg m/s / 1.05457e-34 J s.
Recall that 1 J = 1 kg m2/s2, so units work out: [k] = (kg m/s) / (kg m2/s2) ) = 1/m, which is reciprocal meters.
Calculating k: 2.6702e-20 / 1.05457e-34 ≈ 2.532e14 m^-1.
But the reduced wavelength k̄ is defined as 1/k.
So k̄ = 1 / (2.532e14 m^-1) ≈ 3.949e-15 m.
Convert that to femtometers (fm), since 1 fm = 1e-15 m.
So k̄ ≈ 3.949 fm.
So k̄ ≈ 3.949 fm^-1?
Wait, no.
Wait, k̄ is 1/k, so k is in m^-1, so 1/k is in m.
So k̄ is actually the wavelength divided by 2π.
Wait, I might have confused k and k̄.
Let me check.
In some literature, k is the wave number, which is 2π/λ, and the reduced wave number k̄ is 1/λ.
But in scattering theory, sometimes k is used as the magnitude of the wave vector, so k = |k| = |p|/ħ.
So maybe in this context, k̄ is just 1/k.
But according to the formula, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is f(0) = (1/k̄) sum_{l} (2l+1) sin δ_l.
Wait, but k̄ here is the reduced wave number.
But perhaps in the formula, k̄ is actually hbar/k, or something like that?
Wait, maybe I need to verify the exact definition.
Wait, the scattering amplitude in the forward direction (θ=0) is given by f(0) = (1/k) * sum_{l} (2l +1 ) sin δ_l / k̄.
Wait, maybe there's confusion in notation.
Alternatively, sometimes the reduced wave number k̄ is defined as k̄ = k/2π, where k is the wave number.
But I need to check the formula.
Alternatively, if the scattering amplitude is given by f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) sin δ_l P_l(cosθ), so at θ=0, f(0) = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) sin δ_l P_l(1).
Since P_l(1) = 1, so f(0) = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) sin δ_l.
But here, is k the wave number?
If so, k = p/ħ.
But in our previous calculation, k is about 2.532e14 m^-1.
Then f(0) would have units of (m^2).
Wait, but the answer choices are in femtometers (fm), which is a unit of length.
So that suggests that the question is asking about the product of f(0) and some other term, or perhaps they are using a different definition?
Wait, maybe they are using a different normalization.
Let me check.
Wait, another possibility: in potential scattering, the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is given by f_im(0) = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) sin δ_l.
But if so, then the units would be [f_im(0)] = [1/k] = meters.
But since they are given in femtometers, which is 1e-15 meters, this could be possible.
Wait, but let's compute and see.
Given that k ≈ 2.532e14 m^-1, then 1/k ≈ 3.949e-15 m = 3.949 fm.
Now, compute the sum Σ (2l +1) sin δ_l.
The given phase shifts are:
l=0: δ0=90°, so (2*0 +1) sin90° = 1*1 = 1
l=1: δ1=67°, (2*1 +1)=3, sin67°≈0.9205, so 3*0.9205≈2.7615
l=2: δ2=55°, (2*2 +1)=5, sin55≈0.8192, 5*0.8192≈4.096
l=3: δ3=30°, (2*3 +1)=7, sin30=0.5, 7*0.5=3.5
l=4: δ4=13°, (2*4 +1)=9, sin13≈0.225, 9*0.225≈2.025
Now, sum these up: 1 + 2.7615 + 4.096 +3.5 +2.025 = 1 + 2.7615 = 3.7615; 3.7615 +4.096=7.8575; 7.8575 +3.5=11.3575; 11.3575 +2.025≈13.3825.
So total sum ≈13.3825.
Then f_im(0) = (1/k) * 13.3825 ≈3.949e-15 m *13.3825 ≈3.949e-15 *13.3825 ≈5.293e-14 m.
Convert meters to femtometers: 1 m = 1e15 fm.
So 5.293e-14 m =5.293e-14 *1e15 fm=52.93 fm.
Wait, but none of the answer choices are around 50 fm.
The options are 251.271, 177.675, 355.351, 87163.4.
Hmm.
So clearly, my answer is not among the choices, which means I must have made a mistake.
Let's check.
Wait, first, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of k.
Let's re-express the energy in terms of momentum.
Total energy E = 50 MeV.
Rest mass energy mc2=0.511 MeV.
So, relativistic energy: E2 = (pc)2 + (mc2)2.
So (pc)^2 = E2 - (mc2)^2 = (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 = 2500 - 0.261 = 2499.738 (MeV2).
So pc = sqrt(2499.738)≈49.997 MeV.
Thus, momentum p = 49.997 MeV/c.
Then, how to convert p to kg m/s.

But perhaps another way.
Since E is much larger than mc2, the non-relativistic approximation would have p2/(2m) = E.
Let's compute that and see the difference.
Non-rel: p = sqrt(2mE).
Relativistic: p = sqrt(E2 - m2c^4)/c.
Let's compute both.
First, non-rel: E = 50 MeV.

Wait, but in non-rel terms, E is in Joules, m in kg.
So 50 MeV = 50 *1e6 *1.602e-19 J = 8.01e-12 J.
So p = sqrt(2 *9.109e-31 kg *8.01e-12 J) = sqrt(1.46e-41)≈1.208e-20 kg m/s.
In relativistic terms, pc=49.997 MeV.
Convert that to kg m/s.
pc =49.997 MeV =49.997e6 *1.602e-19 J =8.01e-12 J.
Then, since pc has units of J, and p has units of kg m/s, c is m/s.
So p = (pc)/c =8.01e-12 J /3e8 m/s=2.67e-20 kg m/s.
Wait, so relativistic momentum is 2.67e-20 kg m/s, while non-rel is 1.208e-20 kg m/s.
So there's a factor of ~2.2 difference.
So using relativistic momentum gives a higher p, which would affect k.
Since k = p/ħ, using relativistic p, k =2.67e-20 /1.05457e-34 ≈2.53e14 m^-1, as before.
But if I used non-rel p, k=1.208e-20 /1.05457e-34≈1.145e14 m^-1.
Then 1/k would be ~8.73e-15 m =87.3 fm.
So using non-rel p, my previous calculation would have 1/k ≈87.3 fm, and sum was ~13.38, so f(0)≈87.3*13.38≈1167 fm.
Still not matching options.
But given answer options are much smaller, maybe they used a different formula?
Alternatively, perhaps they are using k in units of 1/cm?
Wait, but no, the answer units are in fm, which is 10^-15 m.
Alternatively, maybe they are using a different definition of the scattering amplitude?
Wait, another approach.
In some treatments, the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is given by Im f(0) = (1/(k2)) Σ (2l +1) sin δ_l.
Wait, if that's the case, then we have an extra 1/k.
Let's see.
Original calculation: I had f(0) = (1/k) * sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.
With k=2.53e14 m^-1, 1/k=3.949e-15 m=3.949 fm.
Multiply by sum=13.38 gives 3.949*13.38≈52.95 fm.
Still not matching.
But the answer choices are an order of magnitude higher.
Wait, perhaps the problem is in cm^-1 or something?
No, the answer is in fm.
Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the "reduced" scattering amplitude, where they absorb the 1/k factor into the definition?
Wait, but no, the standard formula has the 1/k.
Alternatively, maybe the phase shifts are in radians?
Wait, the problem says δ0=90o, δ1=67o, etc.
So they are in degrees.
I converted them to radians for sine.
So sin90°=1, sin67°≈0.9205 (which is in radians?), wait no.
Wait, sin(67 degrees) is approximately 0.9205.
Yes, that's correct.
Let's confirm:
sin(67°)=sin(π*67/180 radians)≈sin(1.169 rad)≈0.920.
Yes, correct.
So that part is okay.
Wait, another thought.
Maybe the formula is actually f(0) = (2/k) sum (2l +1) sin δ_l.
But then it would be double, 2*52.95≈105.9 fm, still not matching.
Alternatively, perhaps the sum over l is only up to the maximum l given?
The problem gives phase shifts up to l=4.
So maybe they assume those are the only non-zero phase shifts.
Which I already included.
Wait, but in my calculation, sum is 13.38.
Let's check the sum again:
l=0: (1) * sin90°=1*1=1
l=1: 3 * sin67°≈3*0.9205≈2.7615
l=2:5*sin55°≈5*0.8192≈4.096
l=3:7*sin30°=7*(0.5)=3.5
l=4:9*sin13°≈9*0.225≈2.025
Adding these up:1 +2.7615=3.7615; +4.096=7.8575; +3.5=11.3575; +2.025=13.38

so first, i need to compute k.
wait, the electrons are 50 mev.
let's make sure i use the correct formula.
since 50 mev is pretty energetic, but maybe the non-relativistic approximation is still okay?
the rest mass energy of an electron is about 0.511 mev, so 50 mev is more than 100 times that, which suggests relativistic effects might be significant.
however, the problem might expect us to use the non-relativistic formula.
hmm.
but i need to check.
wait, in scattering experiments at high energies, even with relativistic particles, the scattering amplitude is often analyzed in terms of non-relativistic formulas for simplicity, unless specifically stated otherwise.
but perhaps the problem gives a hint?
wait, the answer choices are in femtometers (fm), which is 10^-15 m.
so the answer is expected to be in fm.
let's proceed with non-relativistic and see.
if my answer is way off, maybe i'll need to adjust.
but let's start with non-relativistic.
so, first, compute the wavelength k.
electron energy e = 50 mev.
first, convert e to joules.
1 ev = 1.60218e-19 j.
so 50 mev = 50 * 1e6 * 1.60218e-19 j = 50 * 1e6 * 1.60218e-19 = 50 * 1.60218e-13 = 8.0109e-12 j.
but maybe it's easier to use electron mass in ev terms.
the rest mass of electron is about 0.511 mev/c2.
so perhaps better to use the non-relativistic relation e = p2/(2m), so p = sqrt(2me).
then, wavelength k = p/ħ.
let's do that.

alternatively, in natural units where ħ = 1, so k = p.
but i need to compute k in 1/meters.
wait, this might be getting complicated.
let me try step by step.
first, compute the momentum p of a 50 mev electron.
since e = 50 mev, and the electron mass is about 0.511 mev/c2.
so the total energy squared is e2 = (pc)^2 + (m c2)^2.
therefore, (pc)^2 = e2 - (m c2)^2.
so pc = sqrt(e2 - m2c^4).
then, p = (sqrt(e2 - m2c^4))/c.

so, given e = 50 mev, m = 0.511 mev/c2.
therefore, (pc)^2 = (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 = 2500 - 0.261 = 2499.738 (in mev2/c^4).
then pc = sqrt(2499.738) mev/c.
which is approximately sqrt(2499.738) ≈ 49.997 mev/c.
so p = (49.997 mev/c) / c.
wait, that gives momentum p in mev/c units.
hmm.
but i need to convert this into kg m/s.
wait, perhaps it's easier to keep track in natural units where ħ = 1, c = 1, but maybe i need to compute k in 1/m.
wait, the definition of k is 2π/λ, where λ is the wavelength.
from de broglie relation, λ = h/p, so k = 2π p / ħ, since p = ħ k / 2π.
wait, but with ħ = h/(2π), so k = p / ħ.
so if p is in mev/c, and ħ has units of j s, then k would have units of 1/m.
but let's compute this step by step.
first, p in mev/c units: approximately 49.997 mev/c.
so we need to convert this to kg m/s.
1 mev = 1e6 ev = 1e6 * 1.60218e-19 j = 1.60218e-13 j.
so p (in kg m/s) = (49.997 mev/c) * (1.60218e-13 j / (3e8 m/s)).
wait, because 1 mev = 1.60218e-13 j, and c = 3e8 m/s.
so, p = 49.997 * 1.60218e-13 / (3e8) kg m/s.
let's compute that:
49.997 * 1.60218e-13 = 49.997 * 1.60218e-13 ≈ 8.0107e-12 j s/m.
then divide by c = 3e8 m/s:
p = 8.0107e-12 / 3e8 ≈ 2.6702e-20 kg m/s.
now, k = p / ħ.
ħ is approximately 1.05457e-34 j s.
so k = 2.6702e-20 kg m/s / 1.05457e-34 j s.
recall that 1 j = 1 kg m2/s2, so units work out: [k] = (kg m/s) / (kg m2/s2) ) = 1/m, which is reciprocal meters.
calculating k: 2.6702e-20 / 1.05457e-34 ≈ 2.532e14 m^-1.
but the reduced wavelength k̄ is defined as 1/k.
so k̄ = 1 / (2.532e14 m^-1) ≈ 3.949e-15 m.
convert that to femtometers (fm), since 1 fm = 1e-15 m.
so k̄ ≈ 3.949 fm.
so k̄ ≈ 3.949 fm^-1?
wait, no.
wait, k̄ is 1/k, so k is in m^-1, so 1/k is in m.
so k̄ is actually the wavelength divided by 2π.
wait, i might have confused k and k̄.
let me check.
in some literature, k is the wave number, which is 2π/λ, and the reduced wave number k̄ is 1/λ.
but in scattering theory, sometimes k is used as the magnitude of the wave vector, so k = |k| = |p|/ħ.
so maybe in this context, k̄ is just 1/k.
but according to the formula, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is f(0) = (1/k̄) sum_{l} (2l+1) sin δ_l.
wait, but k̄ here is the reduced wave number.
but perhaps in the formula, k̄ is actually hbar/k, or something like that?
wait, maybe i need to verify the exact definition.
wait, the scattering amplitude in the forward direction (θ=0) is given by f(0) = (1/k) * sum_{l} (2l +1 ) sin δ_l / k̄.
wait, maybe there's confusion in notation.
alternatively, sometimes the reduced wave number k̄ is defined as k̄ = k/2π, where k is the wave number.
but i need to check the formula.
alternatively, if the scattering amplitude is given by f(θ) = (1/k) σ (2l +1) sin δ_l p_l(cosθ), so at θ=0, f(0) = (1/k) σ (2l +1) sin δ_l p_l(1).
since p_l(1) = 1, so f(0) = (1/k) σ (2l +1) sin δ_l.
but here, is k the wave number?
if so, k = p/ħ.
but in our previous calculation, k is about 2.532e14 m^-1.
then f(0) would have units of (m^2).
wait, but the answer choices are in femtometers (fm), which is a unit of length.
so that suggests that the question is asking about the product of f(0) and some other term, or perhaps they are using a different definition?
wait, maybe they are using a different normalization.
let me check.
wait, another possibility: in potential scattering, the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is given by f_im(0) = (1/k) σ (2l +1) sin δ_l.
but if so, then the units would be [f_im(0)] = [1/k] = meters.
but since they are given in femtometers, which is 1e-15 meters, this could be possible.
wait, but let's compute and see.
given that k ≈ 2.532e14 m^-1, then 1/k ≈ 3.949e-15 m = 3.949 fm.
now, compute the sum σ (2l +1) sin δ_l.
the given phase shifts are:
l=0: δ0=90°, so (2*0 +1) sin90° = 1*1 = 1
l=1: δ1=67°, (2*1 +1)=3, sin67°≈0.9205, so 3*0.9205≈2.7615
l=2: δ2=55°, (2*2 +1)=5, sin55≈0.8192, 5*0.8192≈4.096
l=3: δ3=30°, (2*3 +1)=7, sin30=0.5, 7*0.5=3.5
l=4: δ4=13°, (2*4 +1)=9, sin13≈0.225, 9*0.225≈2.025
now, sum these up: 1 + 2.7615 + 4.096 +3.5 +2.025 = 1 + 2.7615 = 3.7615; 3.7615 +4.096=7.8575; 7.8575 +3.5=11.3575; 11.3575 +2.025≈13.3825.
so total sum ≈13.3825.
then f_im(0) = (1/k) * 13.3825 ≈3.949e-15 m *13.3825 ≈3.949e-15 *13.3825 ≈5.293e-14 m.
convert meters to femtometers: 1 m = 1e15 fm.
so 5.293e-14 m =5.293e-14 *1e15 fm=52.93 fm.
wait, but none of the answer choices are around 50 fm.
the options are 251.271, 177.675, 355.351, 87163.4.
hmm.
so clearly, my answer is not among the choices, which means i must have made a mistake.
let's check.
wait, first, maybe i made a mistake in the calculation of k.
let's re-express the energy in terms of momentum.
total energy e = 50 mev.
rest mass energy mc2=0.511 mev.
so, relativistic energy: e2 = (pc)2 + (mc2)2.
so (pc)^2 = e2 - (mc2)^2 = (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 = 2500 - 0.261 = 2499.738 (mev2).
so pc = sqrt(2499.738)≈49.997 mev.
thus, momentum p = 49.997 mev/c.
then, how to convert p to kg m/s.

but perhaps another way.
since e is much larger than mc2, the non-relativistic approximation would have p2/(2m) = e.
let's compute that and see the difference.
non-rel: p = sqrt(2me).
relativistic: p = sqrt(e2 - m2c^4)/c.
let's compute both.
first, non-rel: e = 50 mev.

wait, but in non-rel terms, e is in joules, m in kg.
so 50 mev = 50 *1e6 *1.602e-19 j = 8.01e-12 j.
so p = sqrt(2 *9.109e-31 kg *8.01e-12 j) = sqrt(1.46e-41)≈1.208e-20 kg m/s.
in relativistic terms, pc=49.997 mev.
convert that to kg m/s.
pc =49.997 mev =49.997e6 *1.602e-19 j =8.01e-12 j.
then, since pc has units of j, and p has units of kg m/s, c is m/s.
so p = (pc)/c =8.01e-12 j /3e8 m/s=2.67e-20 kg m/s.
wait, so relativistic momentum is 2.67e-20 kg m/s, while non-rel is 1.208e-20 kg m/s.
so there's a factor of ~2.2 difference.
so using relativistic momentum gives a higher p, which would affect k.
since k = p/ħ, using relativistic p, k =2.67e-20 /1.05457e-34 ≈2.53e14 m^-1, as before.
but if i used non-rel p, k=1.208e-20 /1.05457e-34≈1.145e14 m^-1.
then 1/k would be ~8.73e-15 m =87.3 fm.
so using non-rel p, my previous calculation would have 1/k ≈87.3 fm, and sum was ~13.38, so f(0)≈87.3*13.38≈1167 fm.
still not matching options.
but given answer options are much smaller, maybe they used a different formula?
alternatively, perhaps they are using k in units of 1/cm?
wait, but no, the answer units are in fm, which is 10^-15 m.
alternatively, maybe they are using a different definition of the scattering amplitude?
wait, another approach.
in some treatments, the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is given by im f(0) = (1/(k2)) σ (2l +1) sin δ_l.
wait, if that's the case, then we have an extra 1/k.
let's see.
original calculation: i had f(0) = (1/k) * sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.
with k=2.53e14 m^-1, 1/k=3.949e-15 m=3.949 fm.
multiply by sum=13.38 gives 3.949*13.38≈52.95 fm.
still not matching.
but the answer choices are an order of magnitude higher.
wait, perhaps the problem is in cm^-1 or something?
no, the answer is in fm.
alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the "reduced" scattering amplitude, where they absorb the 1/k factor into the definition?
wait, but no, the standard formula has the 1/k.
alternatively, maybe the phase shifts are in radians?
wait, the problem says δ0=90o, δ1=67o, etc.
so they are in degrees.
i converted them to radians for sine.
so sin90°=1, sin67°≈0.9205 (which is in radians?), wait no.
wait, sin(67 degrees) is approximately 0.9205.
yes, that's correct.
let's confirm:
sin(67°)=sin(π*67/180 radians)≈sin(1.169 rad)≈0.920.
yes, correct.
so that part is okay.
wait, another thought.
maybe the formula is actually f(0) = (2/k) sum (2l +1) sin δ_l.
but then it would be double, 2*52.95≈105.9 fm, still not matching.
alternatively, perhaps the sum over l is only up to the maximum l given?
the problem gives phase shifts up to l=4.
so maybe they assume those are the only non-zero phase shifts.
which i already included.
wait, but in my calculation, sum is 13.38.
let's check the sum again:
l=0: (1) * sin90°=1*1=1
l=1: 3 * sin67°≈3*0.9205≈2.7615
l=2:5*sin55°≈5*0.8192≈4.096
l=3:7*sin30°=7*(0.5)=3.5
l=4:9*sin13°≈9*0.225≈2.025
adding these up:1 +2.7615=3.7615; +4.096=7.8575; +3.5=11.3575; +2.025=13.38
