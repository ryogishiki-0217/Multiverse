Okay, so I need to find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron in the spin state (3i, 4). The possible answers are given, so I need to calculate the correct one. First, I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated by taking the bra vector (the conjugate transpose of the ket vector) multiplied by the operator, then multiplied by the ket vector. The spin state given is (3i, 4). Let me write that as a ket vector: |ψ⟩ = [3i; 4]. So, the first step is to write down the formula for the expectation value.
Let's think in parallel.

The product of the second element of ⟨ψ|, 4, with the second element of the column, 0, is 4 * 0 = 0. The sum of these products is -3i² + 0 = -3(-1) = 3. This result is the second element of the intermediate row vector after the first matrix multiplication step.

<Conclusion>
Multiplying ⟨ψ| with the first column of σ_y yields 4i, and multiplying ⟨ψ| with the second column of σ_y yields 3.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So, ⟨ψ|σ_y is the row vector [4i, 3]. Now, we need to multiply this by the ket vector |ψ⟩, which is the column vector [3i; 4]. Multiplying the row vector [4i, 3] by the column vector [3i; 4] gives: 4i * 3i + 3 * 4. Let's compute each term: First term: 4i * 3i = 12i^2 = 12*(-1) = -12. Second term: 3 * 4 = 12. Adding them together: -12 + 12 = 0. Wait, so the expectation value is 0? But that's not one of the options. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check the problem again. The problem says the spin state is (3i, 4). But in quantum mechanics, spin states are usually normalized. Let me check if this state is normalized. The norm squared is |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = (9) + (16) = 25. So the norm is 5. Therefore, the given state is 5 times the normalized state. Wait, so if the state is not normalized, we need to normalize it before calculating the expectation value. Is that right? Wait, actually, the expectation value is calculated as ⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩ divided by ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ if the state is not normalized. But wait, sometimes the state is given as a ket, and even if it's not normalized, the expectation value is still ⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩, but divided by ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ to get the average. Wait, but in some contexts, people use the state vector without normalization. I need to check. So here, the spin state is given as (3i, 4). The norm is sqrt( (3i)(-3i) + 4*4 ) = sqrt(9 + 16) = sqrt(25) = 5. So the norm is 5, so the normalized state would be (3i, 4)/5. But the problem doesn't specify whether the state is normalized or not. Hmm. But in the problem statement, when they say "the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4)", usually that would be a normalized state. But given that (3i, 4) has a norm of 5, unless they normalized it. Wait, maybe they meant the components are 3i and 4, but not necessarily normalized. So perhaps I need to compute the expectation value without normalization, then divide by the norm squared. Wait, let's recall the definition. Expectation value is ⟨A⟩ = ⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩ / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ if the vector is not normalized. If the state is given as (3i, 4), then ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = 25. So we need to compute ⟨ψ|σ_y|ψ⟩ / 25. But in my previous calculation, ⟨ψ|σ_y|ψ⟩ was 0. So then the expectation value would be 0/25 = 0. But 0 is not one of the options. But the options are fractions of hbar with 25 in the denominator. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation. Let's double-check. First, the state is |ψ⟩ = [3i; 4]. The conjugate transpose is ⟨ψ| = [-3i, 4]. The σ_y matrix is [0, -i; i, 0]. So to compute ⟨ψ|σ_y|ψ⟩, we can do it step by step. First, compute σ_y|ψ⟩, then take the inner product with ⟨ψ|. Wait, maybe an alternative way is to first multiply σ_y by |ψ⟩, then take ⟨ψ| times that. Let me try that. First, compute σ_y multiplied by |ψ⟩: σ_y = [0, -i; i, 0]. |ψ⟩ = [3i; 4]. Multiply: First component: 0*(3i) + (-i)*4 = -4i. Second component: i*(3i) + 0*4 = 3i^2 = 3*(-1) = -3. So σ_y|ψ⟩ = [-4i; -3]. Now, take the inner product with ⟨ψ|, which is [-3i, 4]. So ⟨ψ|σ_y|ψ⟩ = [-3i, 4] * [-4i; -3]. Compute component-wise: (-3i)*(-4i) + 4*(-3). First term: (-3i)*(-4i) = 12i^2 = 12*(-1) = -12. Second term: 4*(-3) = -12. Adding them together: -12 + (-12) = -24. Wait, so ⟨ψ|σ_y|ψ⟩ = -24. Then, the norm squared of |ψ⟩ is ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-3i)*(3i) + 4*4 = 9 + 16 = 25. Therefore, the expectation value is -24 / 25. But the expectation value of spin is usually in units of hbar/2. Wait, σ matrices are dimensionless, so S_y = ħ/2 σ_y. Wait, the problem is about spin, so the actual spin operator is S_y = ħ/2 σ_y. Therefore, when calculating the expectation value of S_y, it's ħ/2 times the expectation value of σ_y. Wait, now I need to recall if the given matrix is σ_y or S_y. The problem states "the spin along the y-direction", and gives the matrix as σ_y. But in the question stem it says "the last line of your response should be of the following format: 'boxed{$LETTER}' where LETTER is one of A, B, C, and D". The options are in terms of hbar/2 multiples. So perhaps the expectation value is (ħ/2) * (-24)/25 = -24ħ/(25*2) = -12ħ/25. But the answer option D is -12*hbar/25. So that would be answer D. But wait, let me confirm. First, compute the expectation value of σ_y, then multiply by ħ/2 to get the expectation value of S_y. But in the problem statement, the matrix given is σ_y. However, the actual spin operator is S_y = ħ/2 σ_y. Therefore, when calculating expectation value, we have: ⟨S_y⟩ = ħ/2 ⟨σ_y⟩. But in my calculation, ⟨σ_y⟩ = (-24)/25. Therefore, ⟨S_y⟩ = ħ/2 * (-24/25) = -12ħ/25. Therefore, the answer is D. But earlier, when the state wasn't normalized, we have to divide by the norm squared. So let me check again. The state is |ψ⟩ = [3i; 4], with norm sqrt( (3i)^2*(-3i)^2 + 4^2 )? Wait, hold on, no. Wait, the norm is computed as sqrt( (|3i|^2 ) + (|4|^2 ) ) = sqrt(9 + 16) = 5. So yes, the norm is 5. Therefore, the expectation value is (-24)/25. But then multiplied by ħ/2, so the expectation value of S_y is (-12/25)ħ. So the answer is D) -12*hbar/25. Wait, but now I'm confused because initially I thought maybe the options are given in terms of σ_y, but the question is about the spin along the y-direction, which is an operator with eigenvalues ±ħ/2. Therefore, the expectation value must be in units of ħ. Thus, the answer must include ħ. Therefore, the answer is D. But let me confirm once again. First, the calculation of ⟨σ_y⟩. Given |ψ⟩ = [3i, 4], not normalized. First, compute σ_y |ψ⟩ = [-4i, -3]. Then ⟨ψ|σ_y |ψ⟩ = [-3i, 4] * [-4i, -3]^T. Compute the first term: (-3i)*(-4i) + 4*(-3). First term: (-3i)*(-4i) = 12i^2 = -12. Second term: 4*(-3) = -12. So total is -12 + (-12) = -24. Then, ⟨σ_y⟩ = ⟨ψ|σ_y|ψ⟩ / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = -24 / 25. Therefore, the expectation value of S_y is ħ/2 * (-24/25) = -12ħ/25. So the answer is D. Therefore, the correct answer is D. But before finalizing, let me check if there's any mistake in calculation. Compute σ_y |ψ⟩: σ_y is [0, -i; i, 0]. Multiply by |ψ⟩ = [3i; 4]. First component: 0*(3i) + (-i)*4 = -4i. Second component: i*(3i) + 0*4 = 3i^2 = -3. So σ_y |ψ⟩ = [-4i; -3]. Then ⟨σ_y⟩ product: ⟨ψ| σ_y |ψ⟩ = [-3i, 4] * [-4i, -3]. First term: (-3i)*(-4i) = 12i^2 = -12. Second term: 4*(-3) = -12. So sum is -24. The norm squared is 25, so normalized expectation value is -24/25. Multiply by ħ/2: -12ħ/25. Yes, that seems correct. So the answer is D. Wait, but option A is 12ħ/2 - but that's positive, and the answer is negative. So D is the only negative option with 12, which matches. So yes, D is correct. So the final answer is D. Therefore, I need to box D at the end. But let me think once again. Because sometimes in different sources, the definition of the spin matrix could be different. But the problem explicitly gives the σ_y matrix as [0, -i; i, 0], which is standard. So that's correct. Also, in the problem statement, it's the spin along the y-direction, so S_y operator. So yes, the calculation is right. So, conclusion: the expectation value is -12ħ/25, so answer D. So the final answer is \boxed{D}.

Answer: To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron in the spin state \((3i, 4)\), we need to compute \(\langle S_y \rangle\). The spin state is given as a vector \(\lvert \psi \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}\), which is not normalized. The Pauli matrix \(\sigma_y\) is given by:

\[
\sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}
\]

First, compute the bra vector \(\langle \psi \lvert = (-3i, 4)\).

Next, calculate \(\sigma_y \lvert \psi \rangle\):

\[
\sigma_y \lvert \psi \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -i \cdot 4 \\ i \cdot 3i \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Then, compute the inner product \(\langle \psi \lvert \sigma_y \lvert \psi \rangle\):

\[
\langle \psi \lvert \sigma_y \lvert \psi \rangle = (-3i)(-4i) + 4(-3) = 12i^2 - 12 = 12(-1) - 12 = -12 - 12 = -24
\]

The norm squared of \(\lvert \psi \rangle\) is:

\[
\langle \psi \lvert \psi \rangle = (-3i)(3i) + 4 \cdot 4 = 9 + 16 = 25
\]

The expectation value of \(\sigma_y\) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_y \rangle = \frac{\langle \psi \lvert \sigma_y \lvert \psi \rangle}{\langle \psi \lvert \psi \rangle} = \frac{-24}{25}
\]

Since \(S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y\), the expectation value of \(S_y\) is:

\[
\langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \sigma_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( -\frac{24}{25} \right) = -\frac{12\hbar}{25}
\]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{D}\).

so, ⟨ψ|σ_y is the row vector [4i, 3]. now, we need to multiply this by the ket vector |ψ⟩, which is the column vector [3i; 4]. multiplying the row vector [4i, 3] by the column vector [3i; 4] gives: 4i * 3i + 3 * 4. let's compute each term: first term: 4i * 3i = 12i^2 = 12*(-1) = -12. second term: 3 * 4 = 12. adding them together: -12 + 12 = 0. wait, so the expectation value is 0? but that's not one of the options. wait, that can't be right. let me check the problem again. the problem says the spin state is (3i, 4). but in quantum mechanics, spin states are usually normalized. let me check if this state is normalized. the norm squared is |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = (9) + (16) = 25. so the norm is 5. therefore, the given state is 5 times the normalized state. wait, so if the state is not normalized, we need to normalize it before calculating the expectation value. is that right? wait, actually, the expectation value is calculated as ⟨ψ|a|ψ⟩ divided by ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ if the state is not normalized. but wait, sometimes the state is given as a ket, and even if it's not normalized, the expectation value is still ⟨ψ|a|ψ⟩, but divided by ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ to get the average. wait, but in some contexts, people use the state vector without normalization. i need to check. so here, the spin state is given as (3i, 4). the norm is sqrt( (3i)(-3i) + 4*4 ) = sqrt(9 + 16) = sqrt(25) = 5. so the norm is 5, so the normalized state would be (3i, 4)/5. but the problem doesn't specify whether the state is normalized or not. hmm. but in the problem statement, when they say "the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4)", usually that would be a normalized state. but given that (3i, 4) has a norm of 5, unless they normalized it. wait, maybe they meant the components are 3i and 4, but not necessarily normalized. so perhaps i need to compute the expectation value without normalization, then divide by the norm squared. wait, let's recall the definition. expectation value is ⟨a⟩ = ⟨ψ|a|ψ⟩ / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ if the vector is not normalized. if the state is given as (3i, 4), then ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = 25. so we need to compute ⟨ψ|σ_y|ψ⟩ / 25. but in my previous calculation, ⟨ψ|σ_y|ψ⟩ was 0. so then the expectation value would be 0/25 = 0. but 0 is not one of the options. but the options are fractions of hbar with 25 in the denominator. wait, perhaps i made a mistake in my calculation. let's double-check. first, the state is |ψ⟩ = [3i; 4]. the conjugate transpose is ⟨ψ| = [-3i, 4]. the σ_y matrix is [0, -i; i, 0]. so to compute ⟨ψ|σ_y|ψ⟩, we can do it step by step. first, compute σ_y|ψ⟩, then take the inner product with ⟨ψ|. wait, maybe an alternative way is to first multiply σ_y by |ψ⟩, then take ⟨ψ| times that. let me try that. first, compute σ_y multiplied by |ψ⟩: σ_y = [0, -i; i, 0]. |ψ⟩ = [3i; 4]. multiply: first component: 0*(3i) + (-i)*4 = -4i. second component: i*(3i) + 0*4 = 3i^2 = 3*(-1) = -3. so σ_y|ψ⟩ = [-4i; -3]. now, take the inner product with ⟨ψ|, which is [-3i, 4]. so ⟨ψ|σ_y|ψ⟩ = [-3i, 4] * [-4i; -3]. compute component-wise: (-3i)*(-4i) + 4*(-3). first term: (-3i)*(-4i) = 12i^2 = 12*(-1) = -12. second term: 4*(-3) = -12. adding them together: -12 + (-12) = -24. wait, so ⟨ψ|σ_y|ψ⟩ = -24. then, the norm squared of |ψ⟩ is ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-3i)*(3i) + 4*4 = 9 + 16 = 25. therefore, the expectation value is -24 / 25. but the expectation value of spin is usually in units of hbar/2. wait, σ matrices are dimensionless, so s_y = ħ/2 σ_y. wait, the problem is about spin, so the actual spin operator is s_y = ħ/2 σ_y. therefore, when calculating the expectation value of s_y, it's ħ/2 times the expectation value of σ_y. wait, now i need to recall if the given matrix is σ_y or s_y. the problem states "the spin along the y-direction", and gives the matrix as σ_y. but in the question stem it says "the last line of your response should be of the following format: 'boxed{$letter}' where letter is one of a, b, c, and d". the options are in terms of hbar/2 multiples. so perhaps the expectation value is (ħ/2) * (-24)/25 = -24ħ/(25*2) = -12ħ/25. but the answer option d is -12*hbar/25. so that would be answer d. but wait, let me confirm. first, compute the expectation value of σ_y, then multiply by ħ/2 to get the expectation value of s_y. but in the problem statement, the matrix given is σ_y. however, the actual spin operator is s_y = ħ/2 σ_y. therefore, when calculating expectation value, we have: ⟨s_y⟩ = ħ/2 ⟨σ_y⟩. but in my calculation, ⟨σ_y⟩ = (-24)/25. therefore, ⟨s_y⟩ = ħ/2 * (-24/25) = -12ħ/25. therefore, the answer is d. but earlier, when the state wasn't normalized, we have to divide by the norm squared. so let me check again. the state is |ψ⟩ = [3i; 4], with norm sqrt( (3i)^2*(-3i)^2 + 4^2 )? wait, hold on, no. wait, the norm is computed as sqrt( (|3i|^2 ) + (|4|^2 ) ) = sqrt(9 + 16) = 5. so yes, the norm is 5. therefore, the expectation value is (-24)/25. but then multiplied by ħ/2, so the expectation value of s_y is (-12/25)ħ. so the answer is d) -12*hbar/25. wait, but now i'm confused because initially i thought maybe the options are given in terms of σ_y, but the question is about the spin along the y-direction, which is an operator with eigenvalues ±ħ/2. therefore, the expectation value must be in units of ħ. thus, the answer must include ħ. therefore, the answer is d. but let me confirm once again. first, the calculation of ⟨σ_y⟩. given |ψ⟩ = [3i, 4], not normalized. first, compute σ_y |ψ⟩ = [-4i, -3]. then ⟨ψ|σ_y |ψ⟩ = [-3i, 4] * [-4i, -3]^t. compute the first term: (-3i)*(-4i) + 4*(-3). first term: (-3i)*(-4i) = 12i^2 = -12. second term: 4*(-3) = -12. so total is -12 + (-12) = -24. then, ⟨σ_y⟩ = ⟨ψ|σ_y|ψ⟩ / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = -24 / 25. therefore, the expectation value of s_y is ħ/2 * (-24/25) = -12ħ/25. so the answer is d. therefore, the correct answer is d. but before finalizing, let me check if there's any mistake in calculation. compute σ_y |ψ⟩: σ_y is [0, -i; i, 0]. multiply by |ψ⟩ = [3i; 4]. first component: 0*(3i) + (-i)*4 = -4i. second component: i*(3i) + 0*4 = 3i^2 = -3. so σ_y |ψ⟩ = [-4i; -3]. then ⟨σ_y⟩ product: ⟨ψ| σ_y |ψ⟩ = [-3i, 4] * [-4i, -3]. first term: (-3i)*(-4i) = 12i^2 = -12. second term: 4*(-3) = -12. so sum is -24. the norm squared is 25, so normalized expectation value is -24/25. multiply by ħ/2: -12ħ/25. yes, that seems correct. so the answer is d. wait, but option a is 12ħ/2 - but that's positive, and the answer is negative. so d is the only negative option with 12, which matches. so yes, d is correct. so the final answer is d. therefore, i need to box d at the end. but let me think once again. because sometimes in different sources, the definition of the spin matrix could be different. but the problem explicitly gives the σ_y matrix as [0, -i; i, 0], which is standard. so that's correct. also, in the problem statement, it's the spin along the y-direction, so s_y operator. so yes, the calculation is right. so, conclusion: the expectation value is -12ħ/25, so answer d. so the final answer is \boxed{d}.

answer: to find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron in the spin state \((3i, 4)\), we need to compute \(\langle s_y \rangle\). the spin state is given as a vector \(\lvert \psi \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}\), which is not normalized. the pauli matrix \(\sigma_y\) is given by:

\[
\sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}
\]

first, compute the bra vector \(\langle \psi \lvert = (-3i, 4)\).

next, calculate \(\sigma_y \lvert \psi \rangle\):

\[
\sigma_y \lvert \psi \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -i \cdot 4 \\ i \cdot 3i \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}
\]

then, compute the inner product \(\langle \psi \lvert \sigma_y \lvert \psi \rangle\):

\[
\langle \psi \lvert \sigma_y \lvert \psi \rangle = (-3i)(-4i) + 4(-3) = 12i^2 - 12 = 12(-1) - 12 = -12 - 12 = -24
\]

the norm squared of \(\lvert \psi \rangle\) is:

\[
\langle \psi \lvert \psi \rangle = (-3i)(3i) + 4 \cdot 4 = 9 + 16 = 25
\]

the expectation value of \(\sigma_y\) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_y \rangle = \frac{\langle \psi \lvert \sigma_y \lvert \psi \rangle}{\langle \psi \lvert \psi \rangle} = \frac{-24}{25}
\]

since \(s_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y\), the expectation value of \(s_y\) is:

\[
\langle s_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \sigma_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( -\frac{24}{25} \right) = -\frac{12\hbar}{25}
\]

thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{d}\)
