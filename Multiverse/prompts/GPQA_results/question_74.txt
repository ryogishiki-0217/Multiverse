Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step.
So, the question is about the probability of a single atom decaying within a certain time frame.
We know that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed without decay, and we need to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes.
First, I need to recall how radioactive decay works.
Radioactive decay follows exponential decay, which means the probability of decay is constant over time.
The key concept here is the survival probability, which is the probability that the atom hasn't decayed by a certain time.
The survival probability S(t) at time t is given by S(t) = e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant.
The decay probability P(t) up to time t is then P(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - e^(-λt).
From the problem, we know that P(100) = 0.32.
So, we can use this information to find λ.
Let me write that down:
1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32
Therefore, e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
Taking the natural logarithm on both sides:
-100λ = ln(0.68)
So, λ = -ln(0.68) / 100
Let me calculate that value.
First, compute ln(0.68).
Since 0.68 is less than 1, the natural log will be negative.
I know that ln(0.68) ≈ -0.4009 (I might need to double-check this with a calculator step).
Wait, natural log of 0.68. Let me recall that ln(0.68) is the same as -ln(1/0.68) = -ln(1.470588...).
ln(1.470588) ≈ 0.3856, so ln(0.68) ≈ -0.3856.
Wait, that seems inconsistent with my first thought.
Maybe I should approximate more accurately.
Let me think: ln(0.7) is approximately -0.3567, ln(0.6) is approximately -0.5108.
Since 0.68 is between 0.6 and 0.7, so ln(0.68) should be between -0.5108 and -0.3567.
Let's see:
Using the Taylor series approximation for ln(x) around 1, but x = 0.68 is quite a bit away from 1, so maybe another approach.
Alternatively, use the fact that ln(0.68) = ln(68/100) = ln(17/25).
Not sure if that helps.
Alternatively, recall that ln(0.68) can be calculated using change of base: ln(0.68) = ln(68/100) = ln(68) - ln(100).
ln(68) is approximately 4.2195, ln(100) is 4.6052.
Therefore, ln(68/100) = 4.2195 - 4.6052 = -0.3857.
So, more accurately, ln(0.68) ≈ -0.3857.
Therefore, λ = -(-0.3857)/100 = 0.3857 / 100 ≈ 0.003857 per minute.
Okay, so the decay constant λ is approximately 0.003857 per minute.
Now, the problem states that 50 minutes have already passed without decay.
We need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes.
So, the time frame we're considering now is from t = 50 minutes to t = 50 + 150 = 200 minutes.
However, radioactive decay is a memoryless process.
That means that the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived 50 minutes, is the same as the probability of decay in any 150-minute interval starting from any point.
Therefore, the fact that 50 minutes have already passed without decay doesn't affect the probability for the next 150 minutes.
Wait, no, that's not exactly right.
Let me clarify.
The memoryless property of the exponential distribution means that the probability of surviving an additional time period, given that it has already survived some time, is the same as the survival probability for that additional time period starting from time zero.
So, in other words, the probability that the atom decays between t = 50 and t = 200 minutes, given that it has not decayed by t = 50, is equal to the probability that it decays between t = 0 and t = 150 minutes.
Therefore, the probability we need to compute is actually the probability that the atom decays within 150 minutes, starting from t = 50.
But because of memorylessness, this is the same as the probability that it decays within 150 minutes starting from t = 0.
Therefore, we can calculate the probability as 1 - e^(-λ * 150).
Wait, is that correct?
Let me make sure.
The survival function for an exponential distribution is S(t) = e^(-λt).
The probability that the atom decays between time t1 and t2 is S(t1) - S(t2) = e^(-λt1) - e^(-λt2).
In this case, t1 = 50 minutes and t2 = 200 minutes.
Therefore, the probability of decay between 50 and 200 minutes is e^(-50λ) - e^(-200λ).
Alternatively, since we are given that it has already survived 50 minutes, the conditional probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is [e^(-50λ) - e^(-200λ)] / e^(-50λ) = 1 - e^(-150λ).
Ah, that makes sense.
Because conditional on surviving 50 minutes, we need to compute the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, which is equivalent to the probability of decay within 150 minutes starting from t = 0.
Therefore, the formula is 1 - e^(-150λ).
Alternatively, using conditional probability:
P(50 < T ≤ 200) = P(T ≤ 200) - P(T ≤ 50)
But the conditional probability given that T > 50 is:
P(50 < T ≤ 200 | T > 50) = [P(T ≤ 200) - P(T ≤ 50)] / P(T > 50)
But since P(T > 50) = 1 - P(T ≤ 50), so substituting:
= [ (1 - e^(-200λ) ) - (1 - e^(-50λ)) ] / e^(-50λ)
Simplify numerator:
= [ - e^(-200λ) + e^(-50λ) ] / e^(-50λ)
= e^(-50λ) [1 - e^(-150λ)] / e^(-50λ)
= 1 - e^(-150λ)
Yes, that's correct.
Therefore, the probability is 1 - e^(-150λ).
Therefore, we can compute this value.
So, λ is approximately 0.003857 per minute.
Let me calculate -150 * λ:
-150 * 0.003857 ≈ -0.57855
Now, e^(-0.57855).
Let me approximate this.
I know that e^(-0.5) is approximately 0.6065, and e^(-0.6) is approximately 0.5488.
Since -0.57855 is between -0.5 and -0.6, so e^(-0.57855) would be between 0.5488 and 0.6065.
Let me compute this more accurately.
First, let's compute the exponent:
-0.57855
Let me use the Taylor series expansion for e^x around 0?
But maybe it's easier to use a calculator-like approach.
Alternatively, recall that ln(2) ≈ 0.6931, so e^(-0.57855) is e^(0.57855) in the denominator.
e^0.57855: e^0.5 = 1.6487, e^0.57855 is higher.
0.57855 - 0.5 = 0.07855.
So, e^0.57855 = e^0.5 * e^0.07855 ≈ 1.6487 * 1.0814 (since e^0.07855 ≈ 1 + 0.07855 + (0.07855)^2/2 + ... ≈ 1.07855 + 0.0034 ≈ 1.0819).
Therefore, e^0.57855 ≈ 1.6487 * 1.0819 ≈ 1.6487 * 1.08 = 1.781 + 1.6487*0.0019 ≈ 1.781 + 0.0031 ≈ 1.784.
Therefore, e^(-0.57855) ≈ 1 / 1.784 ≈ 0.5604.
Therefore, 1 - e^(-150λ) ≈ 1 - 0.5604 ≈ 0.4396, which is approximately 44%.
Looking at the options, choice C is 44%, so that would be the answer.
But let me verify my calculation steps again to be careful.
Given that P(100) = 0.32, so 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32, therefore e^(-100λ) = 0.68.
Then ln(0.68) = -100λ.
So λ = -ln(0.68)/100.
So the value of ln(0.68) is key here.
Earlier calculation gives ln(0.68) ≈ -0.3857.
So λ ≈ 0.003857 per minute.
Then, -150 * λ = -150 * 0.003857 ≈ -0.57855.
Then e^(-0.57855) ≈ 0.5604 as before.
Thus, 1 - 0.5604 ≈ 0.4396, which is 43.96%, so approximately 44%.
Checking the options provided: C) 44%
Therefore, the answer should be C.
Wait, but let me check another approach.
Alternatively, use the formula for the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes given it survived 50 minutes.
As per the exponential distribution, the conditional probability is equal to the integral from 50 to 200 of λ e^(-λ t) dt.
Which is equal to e^(-50λ) - e^(-200λ).
Then, compute that:
First, compute e^(-50λ):
λ = -ln(0.68)/100, so 50λ = -50/100 * ln(0.68) = -0.5 * ln(0.68) = ln(0.68^(-0.5)) = ln(1 / 0.68^0.5) = ln(1 / sqrt(0.68)).
sqrt(0.68) is approximately 0.8246, so 1 / 0.8246 ≈ 1.2125.
Therefore, e^(-50λ) ≈ 1.2125?
Wait, but e^(-50λ) should be e^{(ln(0.68) * 50 / 100)} = e^{(ln(0.68) * 0.5)} = (e^{ln(0.68)})^0.5 = 0.68^0.5 = sqrt(0.68) ≈ 0.8246.
Wait, that seems conflicting.
Let me recast:
Since e^(-50λ) = e^{(-50 * (-ln(0.68)/100))} = e^{(50/100) ln(0.68)} } = e^{(0.5 ln(0.68))} } = [e^{ln(0.68)}]^{0.5} } = 0.68^{0.5} = sqrt(0.68) ≈ 0.8246.
Similarly, e^(-200λ) = e^{(-200 * (-ln(0.68)/100))} = e^{2*ln(0.68)} = (e^{ln(0.68)})^2 = 0.68^2 = 0.4624.
Therefore, the probability is e^(-50λ) - e^(-200λ) ≈ 0.8246 - 0.4624 ≈ 0.3622, which is 36.22%.
Wait, but that conflicts with the previous result.
So which is correct?
Wait, here lies the confusion.
If we consider the conditional probability P(50 < T <= 200 | T > 50) = P(T <= 200 -50 | T >50) by memorylessness?
Wait, no.
The memoryless property says that P(T > t + s | T > s) = P(T > t).
But in our case, we need P(50 < T <= 200 | T > 50) = P(T <= 200 -50 | T >50) by memorylessness.
But 200 -50 is 150.
So that would be equal to P(T <= 150).
Which is 1 - e^(-150λ).
But according to this, using the parameter λ, we calculate 1 - e^(-150λ).
But when we calculated e^(-50λ) - e^(-200λ) = 0.8246 - 0.4624 = 0.3622, that was the joint probability of P(50 < T <= 200) without conditioning.
However, the question says: "So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?"
So this is the conditional probability P(decay in next 150 minutes | no decay in first 50 minutes), which is P(50 < T <= 200 | T > 50) = P(T <= 200 -50 | T >50) = P(T <= 150) by memorylessness.
But P(T <= 150) is 1 - e^(-150λ).
But when we compute 1 - e^(-150λ), using λ = -ln(0.68)/100.
Let me compute 150λ = 150 * (-ln(0.68)/100) = 1.5 * (-ln(0.68)).
Thus, e^(-150λ) = e^(1.5 * ln(0.68)) = (e^{ln(0.68)})^1.5 = 0.68^1.5.
Compute 0.68^1.5.
0.68^1.5 is 0.68 * sqrt(0.68).
sqrt(0.68) ≈ 0.8246, so 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.5605.
Thus, 1 - e^(-150λ) ≈ 1 - 0.5605 ≈ 0.4395, which is about 44%.
So that aligns with the previous calculation.
However, when we computed e^(-50λ) - e^(-200λ), which is approximately 0.8246 - 0.4624 ≈ 0.3622, that is the joint probability without conditioning.
But the question is asking for the conditional probability, so we need to divide the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes by the probability that it survives past 50 minutes.
Which is exactly what we did when we got 0.3622 / 0.8246 ≈ 0.439, same as 1 - e^(-150λ).
Indeed:
0.3622 / 0.8246 ≈ 0.439.
Therefore, both methods confirm the probability is approximately 44%.
Therefore, the answer should be C) 44%.
**Final Answer**
\boxed{C}
</Think>

Answer: Given the problem of determining the probability that an atom will decay within the next 150 minutes, given that it has not decayed in the first 50 minutes, we start by using the known decay probability of 32% within 100 minutes to find the decay constant \(\lambda\).

1. **Calculate the decay constant \(\lambda\):**
   \[
   1 - e^{-100\lambda} } = 0.32 \implies e^{-100\lambda} = 0.68
   \]
   Taking the natural logarithm on both sides:
   \[
   -100\lambda = \ln(0.68) \implies \lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100}
   \]
   Using \(\ln(0.68) \approx -0.3857\):
   \[
   \lambda \approx \frac{0.3857}{100} \approx 0.003857 \text{ per minute}
   \]

2. **Use the memoryless property of exponential decay:**
   The probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given it has survived 50 minutes, is the same as the probability of decay within 150 minutes starting from time zero:
   \[
   P(\text{decay in next 150 minutes}) = 1 - e^{-150\lambda}
   \]

3. **Calculate the probability:**
   \[
   150\lambda = 150 \times 0.003857 \approx 0.57855
   \]
   \[
   e^{-0.57855} \approx 0.5605 \implies 1 - 0.5605 \approx 0.4395
   \]

Thus, the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 44%.

The final answer is \(\boxed{C}\).

okay, let's tackle this problem step by step.
so, the question is about the probability of a single atom decaying within a certain time frame.
we know that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
so far, 50 minutes have passed without decay, and we need to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes.
first, i need to recall how radioactive decay works.
radioactive decay follows exponential decay, which means the probability of decay is constant over time.
the key concept here is the survival probability, which is the probability that the atom hasn't decayed by a certain time.
the survival probability s(t) at time t is given by s(t) = e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant.
the decay probability p(t) up to time t is then p(t) = 1 - s(t) = 1 - e^(-λt).
from the problem, we know that p(100) = 0.32.
so, we can use this information to find λ.
let me write that down:
1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32
therefore, e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
taking the natural logarithm on both sides:
-100λ = ln(0.68)
so, λ = -ln(0.68) / 100
let me calculate that value.
first, compute ln(0.68).
since 0.68 is less than 1, the natural log will be negative.
i know that ln(0.68) ≈ -0.4009 (i might need to double-check this with a calculator step).
wait, natural log of 0.68. let me recall that ln(0.68) is the same as -ln(1/0.68) = -ln(1.470588...).
ln(1.470588) ≈ 0.3856, so ln(0.68) ≈ -0.3856.
wait, that seems inconsistent with my first thought.
maybe i should approximate more accurately.
let me think: ln(0.7) is approximately -0.3567, ln(0.6) is approximately -0.5108.
since 0.68 is between 0.6 and 0.7, so ln(0.68) should be between -0.5108 and -0.3567.
let's see:
using the taylor series approximation for ln(x) around 1, but x = 0.68 is quite a bit away from 1, so maybe another approach.
alternatively, use the fact that ln(0.68) = ln(68/100) = ln(17/25).
not sure if that helps.
alternatively, recall that ln(0.68) can be calculated using change of base: ln(0.68) = ln(68/100) = ln(68) - ln(100).
ln(68) is approximately 4.2195, ln(100) is 4.6052.
therefore, ln(68/100) = 4.2195 - 4.6052 = -0.3857.
so, more accurately, ln(0.68) ≈ -0.3857.
therefore, λ = -(-0.3857)/100 = 0.3857 / 100 ≈ 0.003857 per minute.
okay, so the decay constant λ is approximately 0.003857 per minute.
now, the problem states that 50 minutes have already passed without decay.
we need to find the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes.
so, the time frame we're considering now is from t = 50 minutes to t = 50 + 150 = 200 minutes.
however, radioactive decay is a memoryless process.
that means that the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived 50 minutes, is the same as the probability of decay in any 150-minute interval starting from any point.
therefore, the fact that 50 minutes have already passed without decay doesn't affect the probability for the next 150 minutes.
wait, no, that's not exactly right.
let me clarify.
the memoryless property of the exponential distribution means that the probability of surviving an additional time period, given that it has already survived some time, is the same as the survival probability for that additional time period starting from time zero.
so, in other words, the probability that the atom decays between t = 50 and t = 200 minutes, given that it has not decayed by t = 50, is equal to the probability that it decays between t = 0 and t = 150 minutes.
therefore, the probability we need to compute is actually the probability that the atom decays within 150 minutes, starting from t = 50.
but because of memorylessness, this is the same as the probability that it decays within 150 minutes starting from t = 0.
therefore, we can calculate the probability as 1 - e^(-λ * 150).
wait, is that correct?
let me make sure.
the survival function for an exponential distribution is s(t) = e^(-λt).
the probability that the atom decays between time t1 and t2 is s(t1) - s(t2) = e^(-λt1) - e^(-λt2).
in this case, t1 = 50 minutes and t2 = 200 minutes.
therefore, the probability of decay between 50 and 200 minutes is e^(-50λ) - e^(-200λ).
alternatively, since we are given that it has already survived 50 minutes, the conditional probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is [e^(-50λ) - e^(-200λ)] / e^(-50λ) = 1 - e^(-150λ).
ah, that makes sense.
because conditional on surviving 50 minutes, we need to compute the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, which is equivalent to the probability of decay within 150 minutes starting from t = 0.
therefore, the formula is 1 - e^(-150λ).
alternatively, using conditional probability:
p(50 < t ≤ 200) = p(t ≤ 200) - p(t ≤ 50)
but the conditional probability given that t > 50 is:
p(50 < t ≤ 200 | t > 50) = [p(t ≤ 200) - p(t ≤ 50)] / p(t > 50)
but since p(t > 50) = 1 - p(t ≤ 50), so substituting:
= [ (1 - e^(-200λ) ) - (1 - e^(-50λ)) ] / e^(-50λ)
simplify numerator:
= [ - e^(-200λ) + e^(-50λ) ] / e^(-50λ)
= e^(-50λ) [1 - e^(-150λ)] / e^(-50λ)
= 1 - e^(-150λ)
yes, that's correct.
therefore, the probability is 1 - e^(-150λ).
therefore, we can compute this value.
so, λ is approximately 0.003857 per minute.
let me calculate -150 * λ:
-150 * 0.003857 ≈ -0.57855
now, e^(-0.57855).
let me approximate this.
i know that e^(-0.5) is approximately 0.6065, and e^(-0.6) is approximately 0.5488.
since -0.57855 is between -0.5 and -0.6, so e^(-0.57855) would be between 0.5488 and 0.6065.
let me compute this more accurately.
first, let's compute the exponent:
-0.57855
let me use the taylor series expansion for e^x around 0?
but maybe it's easier to use a calculator-like approach.
alternatively, recall that ln(2) ≈ 0.6931, so e^(-0.57855) is e^(0.57855) in the denominator.
e^0.57855: e^0.5 = 1.6487, e^0.57855 is higher.
0.57855 - 0.5 = 0.07855.
so, e^0.57855 = e^0.5 * e^0.07855 ≈ 1.6487 * 1.0814 (since e^0.07855 ≈ 1 + 0.07855 + (0.07855)^2/2 + ... ≈ 1.07855 + 0.0034 ≈ 1.0819).
therefore, e^0.57855 ≈ 1.6487 * 1.0819 ≈ 1.6487 * 1.08 = 1.781 + 1.6487*0.0019 ≈ 1.781 + 0.0031 ≈ 1.784.
therefore, e^(-0.57855) ≈ 1 / 1.784 ≈ 0.5604.
therefore, 1 - e^(-150λ) ≈ 1 - 0.5604 ≈ 0.4396, which is approximately 44%.
looking at the options, choice c is 44%, so that would be the answer.
but let me verify my calculation steps again to be careful.
given that p(100) = 0.32, so 1 - e^(-100λ) = 0.32, therefore e^(-100λ) = 0.68.
then ln(0.68) = -100λ.
so λ = -ln(0.68)/100.
so the value of ln(0.68) is key here.
earlier calculation gives ln(0.68) ≈ -0.3857.
so λ ≈ 0.003857 per minute.
then, -150 * λ = -150 * 0.003857 ≈ -0.57855.
then e^(-0.57855) ≈ 0.5604 as before.
thus, 1 - 0.5604 ≈ 0.4396, which is 43.96%, so approximately 44%.
checking the options provided: c) 44%
therefore, the answer should be c.
wait, but let me check another approach.
alternatively, use the formula for the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes given it survived 50 minutes.
as per the exponential distribution, the conditional probability is equal to the integral from 50 to 200 of λ e^(-λ t) dt.
which is equal to e^(-50λ) - e^(-200λ).
then, compute that:
first, compute e^(-50λ):
λ = -ln(0.68)/100, so 50λ = -50/100 * ln(0.68) = -0.5 * ln(0.68) = ln(0.68^(-0.5)) = ln(1 / 0.68^0.5) = ln(1 / sqrt(0.68)).
sqrt(0.68) is approximately 0.8246, so 1 / 0.8246 ≈ 1.2125.
therefore, e^(-50λ) ≈ 1.2125?
wait, but e^(-50λ) should be e^{(ln(0.68) * 50 / 100)} = e^{(ln(0.68) * 0.5)} = (e^{ln(0.68)})^0.5 = 0.68^0.5 = sqrt(0.68) ≈ 0.8246.
wait, that seems conflicting.
let me recast:
since e^(-50λ) = e^{(-50 * (-ln(0.68)/100))} = e^{(50/100) ln(0.68)} } = e^{(0.5 ln(0.68))} } = [e^{ln(0.68)}]^{0.5} } = 0.68^{0.5} = sqrt(0.68) ≈ 0.8246.
similarly, e^(-200λ) = e^{(-200 * (-ln(0.68)/100))} = e^{2*ln(0.68)} = (e^{ln(0.68)})^2 = 0.68^2 = 0.4624.
therefore, the probability is e^(-50λ) - e^(-200λ) ≈ 0.8246 - 0.4624 ≈ 0.3622, which is 36.22%.
wait, but that conflicts with the previous result.
so which is correct?
wait, here lies the confusion.
if we consider the conditional probability p(50 < t <= 200 | t > 50) = p(t <= 200 -50 | t >50) by memorylessness?
wait, no.
the memoryless property says that p(t > t + s | t > s) = p(t > t).
but in our case, we need p(50 < t <= 200 | t > 50) = p(t <= 200 -50 | t >50) by memorylessness.
but 200 -50 is 150.
so that would be equal to p(t <= 150).
which is 1 - e^(-150λ).
but according to this, using the parameter λ, we calculate 1 - e^(-150λ).
but when we calculated e^(-50λ) - e^(-200λ) = 0.8246 - 0.4624 = 0.3622, that was the joint probability of p(50 < t <= 200) without conditioning.
however, the question says: "so far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. what is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?"
so this is the conditional probability p(decay in next 150 minutes | no decay in first 50 minutes), which is p(50 < t <= 200 | t > 50) = p(t <= 200 -50 | t >50) = p(t <= 150) by memorylessness.
but p(t <= 150) is 1 - e^(-150λ).
but when we compute 1 - e^(-150λ), using λ = -ln(0.68)/100.
let me compute 150λ = 150 * (-ln(0.68)/100) = 1.5 * (-ln(0.68)).
thus, e^(-150λ) = e^(1.5 * ln(0.68)) = (e^{ln(0.68)})^1.5 = 0.68^1.5.
compute 0.68^1.5.
0.68^1.5 is 0.68 * sqrt(0.68).
sqrt(0.68) ≈ 0.8246, so 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.5605.
thus, 1 - e^(-150λ) ≈ 1 - 0.5605 ≈ 0.4395, which is about 44%.
so that aligns with the previous calculation.
however, when we computed e^(-50λ) - e^(-200λ), which is approximately 0.8246 - 0.4624 ≈ 0.3622, that is the joint probability without conditioning.
but the question is asking for the conditional probability, so we need to divide the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes by the probability that it survives past 50 minutes.
which is exactly what we did when we got 0.3622 / 0.8246 ≈ 0.439, same as 1 - e^(-150λ).
indeed:
0.3622 / 0.8246 ≈ 0.439.
therefore, both methods confirm the probability is approximately 44%.
therefore, the answer should be c) 44%.
**final answer**
\boxed{c}
</think>

answer: given the problem of determining the probability that an atom will decay within the next 150 minutes, given that it has not decayed in the first 50 minutes, we start by using the known decay probability of 32% within 100 minutes to find the decay constant \(\lambda\).

1. **calculate the decay constant \(\lambda\):**
   \[
   1 - e^{-100\lambda} } = 0.32 \implies e^{-100\lambda} = 0.68
   \]
   taking the natural logarithm on both sides:
   \[
   -100\lambda = \ln(0.68) \implies \lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100}
   \]
   using \(\ln(0.68) \approx -0.3857\):
   \[
   \lambda \approx \frac{0.3857}{100} \approx 0.003857 \text{ per minute}
   \]

2. **use the memoryless property of exponential decay:**
   the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given it has survived 50 minutes, is the same as the probability of decay within 150 minutes starting from time zero:
   \[
   p(\text{decay in next 150 minutes}) = 1 - e^{-150\lambda}
   \]

3. **calculate the probability:**
   \[
   150\lambda = 150 \times 0.003857 \approx 0.57855
   \]
   \[
   e^{-0.57855} \approx 0.5605 \implies 1 - 0.5605 \approx 0.4395
   \]

thus, the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 44%.

the final answer is \(\boxed{c}\)
