Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a spin-half particle in a linear superposition of spin-up and spin-down states. The question is asking for the expectation value of the operator 10σ_z + 5σ_x. The possible answers are given as A) 0.85, B) -1.4, C) -0.7, D) 1.65. I need to calculate the expectation value up to one decimal place and choose the correct answer. Let me think through this step by step.
First, I recall that the expectation value of an operator Â for a state |ψ⟩ is given by ⟨ψ|Â|ψ⟩. So here, the operator is 10σ_z + 5σ_x, and the state is 0.5|↑⟩ + √3/2|↓⟩. Let me write that state again: |ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + √3/2|↓⟩. I need to compute ⟨ψ| (the dual vector) multiplied by (10σ_z + 5σ_x) multiplied by |ψ⟩.
Let's think in parallel.

<Outline>
1: The dual vector (bra) corresponding to the state vector |ψ⟩.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: The matrix representations of the Pauli matrices σ_z and σ_x, and the operator 10σ_z + 5σ_x.

<Path>
1: The dual vector ⟨ψ| is the Hermitian conjugate of |ψ⟩. For a spin state |ψ⟩ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, the dual vector is ⟨ψ| = a*⟨↑| + b*⟨↓|, where * denotes complex conjugation. The coefficients a and b in |ψ⟩ are 0.5 and √3/2, respectively. Assuming these coefficients are real, their complex conjugates are the same as the original values. The dual vector is thus ⟨ψ| = 0.5⟨↑| + (√3/2)⟨↓|.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The Pauli matrices σ_z and σ_x are recalled. The σ_z matrix is [[1, 0], [0, -1]], and the σ_x matrix is [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. The operator 10σ_z + 5σ_x is therefore [[10*1 + 5*0, 10*0 + 5*1], [10*0 + 5*1, 10*(-1) + 5*0]], which simplifies to [[10, 5], [5, -10]].
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The dual vector is ⟨ψ| = 0.5⟨↑| + (√3/2)⟨↓|. The operator 10σ_z + 5σ_x is represented by the matrix [[10, 5], [5, -10]].
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Let me verify that. σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]], so 10σ_z is [[10,0],[0,-10]]. σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so 5σ_x is [[0,5],[5,0]]. Adding them together gives [[10+0, 0+5],[0+5, -10+0]] = [[10,5],[5,-10]]. Yep, that's correct.
Now, to compute ⟨ψ|(10σ_z + 5σ_x)|ψ⟩, I can either do this in matrix form or using bra-ket notation. Let me use bra-ket notation to expand the terms.
First, let's write out |ψ⟩ and ⟨ψ|: |ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩, so ⟨ψ| = 0.5⟨↑| + (√3/2)⟨↓|.
Therefore, ⟨ψ|(10σ_z + 5σ_x)|ψ⟩ = [0.5⟨↑| + (√3/2)⟨↓|] * [10σ_z + 5σ_x] * [0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩].
This looks a bit messy, but I can expand it step by step.
First, let's compute the action of the operator 10σ_z + 5σ_x on the state |ψ⟩.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: The result of the operator (10σ_z + 5σ_x) acting on the state |ψ⟩.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: The inner product of the dual vector ⟨ψ| with the resulting vector from the operator acting on |ψ⟩.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The operator (10σ_z + 5σ_x) acts on the state |ψ⟩, which is 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩. The state |ψ⟩ is expanded and multiplied by the operator, yielding 0.5*(10σ_z + 5σ_x)|↑⟩ + (√3/2)*(10σ_z + 5σ_x)|↓⟩. The action of 10σ_z + 5σ_x on |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ is considered. The Pauli matrix σ_z has eigenvalues +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩, while σ_x has eigenvalues +1 for |↓⟩ when acting on |↑⟩ and for |↑⟩ when acting on |↓⟩.
The action of σ_z on |↑⟩ is |↑⟩, and on |↓⟩ is -|↓⟩.
The action of σ_x on |↑⟩ is |↓⟩, and on |↓⟩ is |↑⟩.
Consequently, (10σ_z + 5σ_x)|↑⟩ is 10*|↑⟩ + 5*σ_x|↑⟩, which is 10|↑⟩ + 5|↓⟩.
Similarly, (10σ_z + 5σ_x)|↓⟩ is 10*(-1)*|↓⟩ + 5*σ_x|↓⟩, which is -10|↓⟩ + 5|↑⟩.
Therefore, the operator acting on |ψ⟩ yields 0.5*(10|↑⟩ + 5|↓⟩) + (√3/2)*(-10|↓⟩ + 5|↑⟩).
This expression is further expanded.
The first term, 0.5*(10|↑⟩ + 5|↓⟩), becomes 5|↑⟩ + (5/2)|↓⟩.
The second term, (√3/2)*(-10|↓⟩ + 5|↑⟩), becomes -5√3|↓⟩ + (5√3/2)|↑⟩.
The results from the two terms are combined.
The coefficients of |↑⟩ are 5 and (5√3)/2.
The coefficients of |↓⟩ are 5/2 and -5√3.
The final expression for the operator acting on |ψ⟩ is (5 + (5√3)/2)|↑⟩ + (5/2 - 5√3)|↓⟩.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The inner product is calculated by combining the terms from the dual vector with the corresponding terms from the operator-acted vector.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The operator (10σ_z + 5σ_x) acting on |ψ⟩ yields the state (5 + (5√3)/2)|↑⟩ + (5/2 - 5√3)|↓⟩. The inner product ⟨ψ| ... is set up using the dual vector ⟨ψ| = 0.5⟨↑| + (√3/2)⟨↓|.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Therefore, the inner product becomes: 0.5⟨↑| applied to (5 + 5√3/2)|↑⟩ + (5/2 -5√3)|↓⟩, plus √3/2 ⟨↓| applied to the same vector.
Breaking this down further: First term: 0.5 [ ⟨↑| (5 + 5√3/2)|↑⟩ + (5/2 -5√3)⟨↑|↓⟩ ] Second term: √3/2 [ ⟨↓| (5 +5√3/2)|↑⟩ + (5/2 -5√3)|↓⟩ ]
Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are orthonormal, ⟨↑|↑⟩ = 1, ⟨↓|↓⟩=1, and ⟨↑|↓⟩=⟨↓|↑⟩=0.
Therefore, simplifying: First term: 0.5 [ (5 +5√3/2)*1 + (5/2 -5√3)*0 ] = 0.5*(5 +5√3/2) Second term: √3/2 [ (5 +5√3/2)*0 + (5/2 -5√3)*1 ] = √3/2*(5/2 -5√3)
Now compute these two terms separately.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: The value of the first term, 0.5*(5 + 5√3/2).
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: The value of the second term, √3/2*(5/2 - 5√3).
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The first term is 0.5*(5 + 5√3/2). This expression is simplified by factoring out the common factor of 5/2, yielding 0.5 * (5/2)(2 + √3) is (5/2) * (1 + √3), which is (5/4)(1 + √3) expands to 5√3)/2, which is (5*3)/2, or 15/2. A corrected simplification is 0.5 )*(5√3/2 ) is (5√3/4) * 5/2) - (√3/2 *5√3).
The first part of this expansion is (5√3)/4.
The second part of this expansion is - (5*3)/4, which is -15/4.
The sum of these parts is 5√3/4 - 15/4.
The first term calculation is 0.5*(5 + 5√3/2) = 5/2 + 5√3/4.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The second term is √3/2 multiplied by (5/2 - 5√3). This is equivalent to (√3/2)*(5/2) - (√3/2)*(5√3). The first part of the second term, (√3/2)*(5/2), simplifies to (5√3)/4). The second part, (√3/2)*(5√3), simplifies to (5*3)/6, then to 15/2.
The term (√3/2)*(5/2 - 5√3) is expanded to (√3/2)*(5/2) - (√3/2)*(5√3).
This expands to (5√3)/4).
The second part expands to - (5*3)/ 5*3)/2*2, which is -15/2.
The second term overall is (5√3)/4 - 15/2.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The value of the first term is 5/2 + 5√3/4. The value of the second term is (5√3)/4 - 15/2.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Now, combining the two terms: First term: 5/2 +5√3/4 Second term:5√3/4 -15/2 Total expectation value: (5/2 +5√3/4) + (5√3/4 -15/2) = (5/2 -15/2) + (5√3/4 +5√3/4) = (-10/2) + (10√3/4) = -5 + (5√3)/2
So the expectation value simplifies to -5 + (5√3)/2.
Let me compute that numerically. First, √3 is approximately 1.732. So 5√3 /2 is (5*1.732)/2 ≈8.66/2≈4.33. Then, -5 +4.33≈-0.67.
Wait, but let's check the exact expression again to make sure.
Wait, expectation value is -5 + (5√3)/2. So let's calculate (5√3)/2 first: 5/2 *√3 ≈2.5 *1.732≈4.33. Then subtract 5: 4.33 -5≈-0.67.
However, the answer choices are A) 0.85, B)-1.4, C)-0.7, D)1.65.
So -0.67 is approximately -0.7. So answer C) -0.7.
Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check each step.
First, let's recap the steps:
1. The state |ψ⟩ is 0.5|↑⟩ + √3/2 |↓⟩. The dual vector is ⟨ψ| =0.5⟨↑| + √3 /2 ⟨↓|.
2. The operator is 10σ_z +5σ_x, which we first applied to |ψ⟩, then took the inner product with ⟨ψ|.
3. When applying the operator to |ψ⟩, we got: (5 +5√3/2)|↑⟩ + (5/2 -5√3)|↓⟩.
4. Then, the inner product with ⟨ψ| gives: 0.5*(5 +5√3/2) + √3 /2*(5/2 -5√3).
5. Calculating these terms: First term:0.5*(5 +5√3/2)= 5/2 +5√3/4≈2.5 +2.165≈4.665 Second term: √3 /2*(5/2 -5√3)= (√3 /2)*(5/2) - (√3 /2)*(5√3)= (5√3)/4 - (5*3)/2=5√3/4 -15/2≈2.165 -7.5≈-5.335
Adding the two terms:4.665 +(-5.335)= -0.67≈-0.67, which is -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place. So answer C) -0.7.
Wait, but let me check if I perhaps made an error in applying the operator.
Let me re-derive the action of 10σ_z +5σ_x on |↑⟩ and |↓⟩.
For |↑⟩: σ_z |↑⟩=|↑⟩, so 10σ_z |↑⟩=10|↑⟩. σ_x |↑⟩=|↓⟩, so 5σ_x |↑⟩=5|↓⟩. Therefore, (10σ_z +5σ_x)|↑⟩=10|↑⟩ +5|↓⟩.
Similarly, for |↓⟩: σ_z |↓⟩=-|↓⟩, so 10σ_z |↓⟩=-10|↓⟩. σ_x |↓⟩=|↑⟩, so 5σ_x |↓⟩=5|↑⟩. Therefore, (10σ_z +5σ_x)|↓⟩= -10|↓⟩ +5|↑⟩. Correct.
So applying the operator to |ψ⟩ which is 0.5|↑⟩ +√3/2 |↓⟩ gives: 0.5*(10|↑⟩ +5|↓⟩) +√3/2*(5|↑⟩ -10|↓⟩).
Wait, hold on: In the previous steps, when applying to |↓⟩, the operator gives 5|↑⟩ -10|↓⟩, so multiplying by √3/2 gives √3/2*(5|↑⟩ -10|↓⟩)= (5√3/2)|↑⟩ -10√3/2 |↓⟩. Then combining terms: The coefficient for |↑⟩ is 0.5*10 +5√3/2=5 +5√3/2. The coefficient for |↓⟩ is 0.5*5 + (-10√3/2)=5/2 -5√3. So yes, the result is (5 +5√3/2)|↑⟩ + (5/2 -5√3)|↓⟩.
Therefore, proceeding with the inner product: 0.5*(5 +5√3/2) +√3/2*(5/2 -5√3). Correct. Then expanding these terms. Let me recompute them step by step.
First term:0.5*(5 +5√3/2) =0.5*5 +0.5*(5√3/2)=2.5 + (5√3)/4. Second term:√3/2*(5/2 -5√3)= (√3/2)*(5/2) - (√3 /2)*(5√3)= (5√3)/4 - (5*3)/2= (5√3)/4 -15/2≈(5*1.732)/4 -7.5≈8.66/4 -7.5≈2.165 -7.5≈-5.335. Adding the two terms: First term:2.5 +2.165=4.665. Second term:-5.335. Total:4.665 -5.335≈-0.67.
Rounded to one decimal place, -0.7. So answer is C) -0.7.
Let me cross-verify this by another method: Since the expectation value of σ_z is ⟨σ_z⟩= |a|^2 - |b|^2 where |↑⟩=a and |↓⟩=b. Here, a=0.5, b=√3/2. So |a|^2=0.25, |b|^2=0.75. Thus, ⟨σ_z⟩=0.25 -0.75= -0.5.
The expectation value of σ_x: for spin-1/2 particles, the expectation value of σ_x is 2*Re⟨↑|ψ⟩⟨ψ|↓⟩. Wait, actually, generally ⟨σ_x⟩=⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩. Since σ_x is |↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|. So ⟨σ_x⟩=⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩= (0.5⟨↑| + √3/2⟨↓|) σ_x (0.5|↑⟩ +√3/2|↓⟩). Applying σ_x to |↑⟩ gives |↓⟩, and to |↓⟩ gives |↑⟩. Therefore: ⟨σ_x⟩=0.5*√3/2 * ⟨↑|σ_x|↑⟩ + other terms. Wait, no. Let's expand properly: ⟨ψ| σ_x |ψ⟩= (0.5⟨↑| + √3/2 ⟨↓|) σ_x (0.5|↑⟩ + √3/2 |↓⟩). =0.5*0.5 ⟨↑|σ_x|↑⟩ +0.5*(√3/2)⟨↑|σ_x|↓⟩ + (√3/2)*0.5 ⟨↓|σ_x|↑⟩ + (√3/2)*(√3/2)⟨↓|σ_x|↓⟩.
Now, σ_x |↑⟩=|↓⟩, so ⟨↑|σ_x|↑⟩=⟨↑|↓⟩=0; σ_x|↑⟩=|↓⟩, so ⟨↑|σ_x|↑⟩=⟨↑|↓⟩=0. σ_x|↑⟩=|↓⟩, so term 1:0.5*0.5 ⟨↑|σ_x|↑⟩=0.25*0=0. Term 2:0.5*(√3/2)*⟨↑|σ_x|↓⟩. σ_x|↓⟩=|↑⟩, so ⟨↑|σ_x|↓⟩=⟨↑|↑⟩=1. So term2=0.5*(√3/2)=√3/4≈0.433. Term3: (√3/2)*0.5*⟨↓|σ_x|↑⟩. σ_x|↑⟩=|↓⟩, so ⟨↓|σ_x|↑⟩=⟨↓|↓⟩=1. So term3=√3/4≈0.433. Term4:(√3/2)*(√3/2)*⟨↓|σ_x|↓⟩. σ_x|↓⟩=|↑⟩, so ⟨↓|σ_x|↓⟩=⟨↓|↑⟩=0. So term4=0. Therefore, total ⟨σ_x⟩= term2 + term3= √3/4 +√3/4= √3/2≈0.866.
Therefore, ⟨σ_x⟩≈0.866.
Now, the expectation value of 10σ_z +5σ_x is 10⟨σ_z⟩ +5⟨σ_x⟩.
We already have ⟨σ_z⟩= -0.5, ⟨σ_x⟩≈0.866.
Thus, 10*(-0.5) +5*(0.866)= -5 +4.33≈-0.67, which rounds to -0.7. So answer is C) -0.7.
Therefore, the final answer is \boxed{C}
</Think>

Answer: To find the expectation value of the operator \(10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x\) for the given state \(|\psi\rangle = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \sqrt{3}/2|\downarrow\rangle\), we follow these steps:

1. **Compute the expectation value of \(\sigma_z\)**:
   - The state coefficients are \(a = 0.5\) for \(|\uparrow\rangle\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}/2\) for \(|\downarrow\rangle\).
   - The expectation value \(\langle \sigma_z \rangle = |a|^2 - |b|^2 = (0.5)^2 - (\sqrt{3}/2)^2 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5\).

2. **Compute the expectation value of \(\sigma_x\)**:
   - Using the given state, we calculate \(\langle \sigma_x \rangle\) by expanding the terms:
     \[
     \langle \sigma_x \rangle = \left(0.5\langle\uparrow| + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\langle\downarrow|\right) \sigma_x \left(0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle\right)
     \]
   - The non-zero terms are:
     \[
     \langle\uparrow|\sigma_x|\downarrow\rangle = \langle\downarrow|\sigma_x|\uparrow\rangle = 1
     \]
   - Therefore:
     \[
     \langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \times \left(0.5 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866
     \]

3. **Combine the results**:
   - The expectation value of the operator \(10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x\) is:
     \[
     10 \langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5 \langle \sigma_x \rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     10(-0.5) + 5 \times 0.866 = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67
     \]
   - Rounded to one decimal place, this is \(-0.7\).

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{C}\).

okay, so i've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a spin-half particle in a linear superposition of spin-up and spin-down states. the question is asking for the expectation value of the operator 10σ_z + 5σ_x. the possible answers are given as a) 0.85, b) -1.4, c) -0.7, d) 1.65. i need to calculate the expectation value up to one decimal place and choose the correct answer. let me think through this step by step.

let me verify that. σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]], so 10σ_z is [[10,0],[0,-10]]. σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so 5σ_x is [[0,5],[5,0]]. adding them together gives [[10+0, 0+5],[0+5, -10+0]] = [[10,5],[5,-10]]. yep, that's correct.

1: the operator (10σ_z + 5σ_x) acts on the state |ψ⟩, which is 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩. the state |ψ⟩ is expanded and multiplied by the operator, yielding 0.5*(10σ_z + 5σ_x)|↑⟩ + (√3/2)*(10σ_z + 5σ_x)|↓⟩. the action of 10σ_z + 5σ_x on |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ is considered. the pauli matrix σ_z has eigenvalues +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩, while σ_x has eigenvalues +1 for |↓⟩ when acting on |↑⟩ and for |↑⟩ when acting on |↓⟩.
the action of σ_z on |↑⟩ is |↑⟩, and on |↓⟩ is -|↓⟩.
the action of σ_x on |↑⟩ is |↓⟩, and on |↓⟩ is |↑⟩.

similarly, (10σ_z + 5σ_x)|↓⟩ is 10*(-1)*|↓⟩ + 5*σ_x|↓⟩, which is -10|↓⟩ + 5|↑⟩.
therefore, the operator acting on |ψ⟩ yields 0.5*(10|↑⟩ + 5|↓⟩) + (√3/2)*(-10|↓⟩ + 5|↑⟩).
this expression is further expanded.
the first term, 0.5*(10|↑⟩ + 5|↓⟩), becomes 5|↑⟩ + (5/2)|↓⟩.
the second term, (√3/2)*(-10|↓⟩ + 5|↑⟩), becomes -5√3|↓⟩ + (5√3/2)|↑⟩.
the results from the two terms are combined.
the coefficients of |↑⟩ are 5 and (5√3)/2.
the coefficients of |↓⟩ are 5/2 and -5√3.
the final expression for the operator acting on |ψ⟩ is (5 + (5√3)/2)|↑⟩ + (5/2 - 5√3)|↓⟩.

<conclusion>
the operator (10σ_z + 5σ_x) acting on |ψ⟩ yields the state (5 + (5√3)/2)|↑⟩ + (5/2 - 5√3)|↓⟩. the inner product ⟨ψ| ... is set up using the dual vector ⟨ψ| = 0.5⟨↑| + (√3/2)⟨↓|.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
therefore, the inner product becomes: 0.5⟨↑| applied to (5 + 5√3/2)|↑⟩ + (5/2 -5√3)|↓⟩, plus √3/2 ⟨↓| applied to the same vector.
breaking this down further: first term: 0.5 [ ⟨↑| (5 + 5√3/2)|↑⟩ + (5/2 -5√3)⟨↑|↓⟩ ] second term: √3/2 [ ⟨↓| (5 +5√3/2)|↑⟩ + (5/2 -5√3)|↓⟩ ]
since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are orthonormal, ⟨↑|↑⟩ = 1, ⟨↓|↓⟩=1, and ⟨↑|↓⟩=⟨↓|↑⟩=0.
therefore, simplifying: first term: 0.5 [ (5 +5√3/2)*1 + (5/2 -5√3)*0 ] = 0.5*(5 +5√3/2) second term: √3/2 [ (5 +5√3/2)*0 + (5/2 -5√3)*1 ] = √3/2*(5/2 -5√3)
now compute these two terms separately.
let's think in parallel.

1: the first term is 0.5*(5 + 5√3/2). this expression is simplified by factoring out the common factor of 5/2, yielding 0.5 * (5/2)(2 + √3) is (5/2) * (1 + √3), which is (5/4)(1 + √3) expands to 5√3)/2, which is (5*3)/2, or 15/2. a corrected simplification is 0.5 )*(5√3/2 ) is (5√3/4) * 5/2) - (√3/2 *5√3).
the first part of this expansion is (5√3)/4.
the second part of this expansion is - (5*3)/4, which is -15/4.
the sum of these parts is 5√3/4 - 15/4.
the first term calculation is 0.5*(5 + 5√3/2) = 5/2 + 5√3/4.
</path>
<path>
2: the second term is √3/2 multiplied by (5/2 - 5√3). this is equivalent to (√3/2)*(5/2) - (√3/2)*(5√3). the first part of the second term, (√3/2)*(5/2), simplifies to (5√3)/4). the second part, (√3/2)*(5√3), simplifies to (5*3)/6, then to 15/2.
the term (√3/2)*(5/2 - 5√3) is expanded to (√3/2)*(5/2) - (√3/2)*(5√3).
this expands to (5√3)/4).
the second part expands to - (5*3)/ 5*3)/2*2, which is -15/2.
the second term overall is (5√3)/4 - 15/2.
</path>
<conclusion>
the value of the first term is 5/2 + 5√3/4. the value of the second term is (5√3)/4 - 15/2.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
now, combining the two terms: first term: 5/2 +5√3/4 second term:5√3/4 -15/2 total expectation value: (5/2 +5√3/4) + (5√3/4 -15/2) = (5/2 -15/2) + (5√3/4 +5√3/4) = (-10/2) + (10√3/4) = -5 + (5√3)/2
so the expectation value simplifies to -5 + (5√3)/2.
let me compute that numerically. first, √3 is approximately 1.732. so 5√3 /2 is (5*1.732)/2 ≈8.66/2≈4.33. then, -5 +4.33≈-0.67.
wait, but let's check the exact expression again to make sure.
wait, expectation value is -5 + (5√3)/2. so let's calculate (5√3)/2 first: 5/2 *√3 ≈2.5 *1.732≈4.33. then subtract 5: 4.33 -5≈-0.67.
however, the answer choices are a) 0.85, b)-1.4, c)-0.7, d)1.65.
so -0.67 is approximately -0.7. so answer c) -0.7.
wait, but maybe i made a mistake in the calculation. let me double-check each step.
first, let's recap the steps:
1. the state |ψ⟩ is 0.5|↑⟩ + √3/2 |↓⟩. the dual vector is ⟨ψ| =0.5⟨↑| + √3 /2 ⟨↓|.
2. the operator is 10σ_z +5σ_x, which we first applied to |ψ⟩, then took the inner product with ⟨ψ|.
3. when applying the operator to |ψ⟩, we got: (5 +5√3/2)|↑⟩ + (5/2 -5√3)|↓⟩.
4. then, the inner product with ⟨ψ| gives: 0.5*(5 +5√3/2) + √3 /2*(5/2 -5√3).
5. calculating these terms: first term:0.5*(5 +5√3/2)= 5/2 +5√3/4≈2.5 +2.165≈4.665 second term: √3 /2*(5/2 -5√3)= (√3 /2)*(5/2) - (√3 /2)*(5√3)= (5√3)/4 - (5*3)/2=5√3/4 -15/2≈2.165 -7.5≈-5.335
adding the two terms:4.665 +(-5.335)= -0.67≈-0.67, which is -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place. so answer c) -0.7.
wait, but let me check if i perhaps made an error in applying the operator.
let me re-derive the action of 10σ_z +5σ_x on |↑⟩ and |↓⟩.
for |↑⟩: σ_z |↑⟩=|↑⟩, so 10σ_z |↑⟩=10|↑⟩. σ_x |↑⟩=|↓⟩, so 5σ_x |↑⟩=5|↓⟩. therefore, (10σ_z +5σ_x)|↑⟩=10|↑⟩ +5|↓⟩.
similarly, for |↓⟩: σ_z |↓⟩=-|↓⟩, so 10σ_z |↓⟩=-10|↓⟩. σ_x |↓⟩=|↑⟩, so 5σ_x |↓⟩=5|↑⟩. therefore, (10σ_z +5σ_x)|↓⟩= -10|↓⟩ +5|↑⟩. correct.
so applying the operator to |ψ⟩ which is 0.5|↑⟩ +√3/2 |↓⟩ gives: 0.5*(10|↑⟩ +5|↓⟩) +√3/2*(5|↑⟩ -10|↓⟩).
wait, hold on: in the previous steps, when applying to |↓⟩, the operator gives 5|↑⟩ -10|↓⟩, so multiplying by √3/2 gives √3/2*(5|↑⟩ -10|↓⟩)= (5√3/2)|↑⟩ -10√3/2 |↓⟩. then combining terms: the coefficient for |↑⟩ is 0.5*10 +5√3/2=5 +5√3/2. the coefficient for |↓⟩ is 0.5*5 + (-10√3/2)=5/2 -5√3. so yes, the result is (5 +5√3/2)|↑⟩ + (5/2 -5√3)|↓⟩.
therefore, proceeding with the inner product: 0.5*(5 +5√3/2) +√3/2*(5/2 -5√3). correct. then expanding these terms. let me recompute them step by step.
first term:0.5*(5 +5√3/2) =0.5*5 +0.5*(5√3/2)=2.5 + (5√3)/4. second term:√3/2*(5/2 -5√3)= (√3/2)*(5/2) - (√3 /2)*(5√3)= (5√3)/4 - (5*3)/2= (5√3)/4 -15/2≈(5*1.732)/4 -7.5≈8.66/4 -7.5≈2.165 -7.5≈-5.335. adding the two terms: first term:2.5 +2.165=4.665. second term:-5.335. total:4.665 -5.335≈-0.67.
rounded to one decimal place, -0.7. so answer is c) -0.7.
let me cross-verify this by another method: since the expectation value of σ_z is ⟨σ_z⟩= |a|^2 - |b|^2 where |↑⟩=a and |↓⟩=b. here, a=0.5, b=√3/2. so |a|^2=0.25, |b|^2=0.75. thus, ⟨σ_z⟩=0.25 -0.75= -0.5.
the expectation value of σ_x: for spin-1/2 particles, the expectation value of σ_x is 2*re⟨↑|ψ⟩⟨ψ|↓⟩. wait, actually, generally ⟨σ_x⟩=⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩. since σ_x is |↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|. so ⟨σ_x⟩=⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩= (0.5⟨↑| + √3/2⟨↓|) σ_x (0.5|↑⟩ +√3/2|↓⟩). applying σ_x to |↑⟩ gives |↓⟩, and to |↓⟩ gives |↑⟩. therefore: ⟨σ_x⟩=0.5*√3/2 * ⟨↑|σ_x|↑⟩ + other terms. wait, no. let's expand properly: ⟨ψ| σ_x |ψ⟩= (0.5⟨↑| + √3/2 ⟨↓|) σ_x (0.5|↑⟩ + √3/2 |↓⟩). =0.5*0.5 ⟨↑|σ_x|↑⟩ +0.5*(√3/2)⟨↑|σ_x|↓⟩ + (√3/2)*0.5 ⟨↓|σ_x|↑⟩ + (√3/2)*(√3/2)⟨↓|σ_x|↓⟩.
now, σ_x |↑⟩=|↓⟩, so ⟨↑|σ_x|↑⟩=⟨↑|↓⟩=0; σ_x|↑⟩=|↓⟩, so ⟨↑|σ_x|↑⟩=⟨↑|↓⟩=0. σ_x|↑⟩=|↓⟩, so term 1:0.5*0.5 ⟨↑|σ_x|↑⟩=0.25*0=0. term 2:0.5*(√3/2)*⟨↑|σ_x|↓⟩. σ_x|↓⟩=|↑⟩, so ⟨↑|σ_x|↓⟩=⟨↑|↑⟩=1. so term2=0.5*(√3/2)=√3/4≈0.433. term3: (√3/2)*0.5*⟨↓|σ_x|↑⟩. σ_x|↑⟩=|↓⟩, so ⟨↓|σ_x|↑⟩=⟨↓|↓⟩=1. so term3=√3/4≈0.433. term4:(√3/2)*(√3/2)*⟨↓|σ_x|↓⟩. σ_x|↓⟩=|↑⟩, so ⟨↓|σ_x|↓⟩=⟨↓|↑⟩=0. so term4=0. therefore, total ⟨σ_x⟩= term2 + term3= √3/4 +√3/4= √3/2≈0.866.
therefore, ⟨σ_x⟩≈0.866.
now, the expectation value of 10σ_z +5σ_x is 10⟨σ_z⟩ +5⟨σ_x⟩.
we already have ⟨σ_z⟩= -0.5, ⟨σ_x⟩≈0.866.
thus, 10*(-0.5) +5*(0.866)= -5 +4.33≈-0.67, which rounds to -0.7. so answer is c) -0.7.
therefore, the final answer is \boxed{c}

answer: to find the expectation value of the operator \(10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x\) for the given state \(|\psi\rangle = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \sqrt{3}/2|\downarrow\rangle\), we follow these steps:

1. **compute the expectation value of \(\sigma_z\)**:
   - the state coefficients are \(a = 0.5\) for \(|\uparrow\rangle\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}/2\) for \(|\downarrow\rangle\).
   - the expectation value \(\langle \sigma_z \rangle = |a|^2 - |b|^2 = (0.5)^2 - (\sqrt{3}/2)^2 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5\).

2. **compute the expectation value of \(\sigma_x\)**:
   - using the given state, we calculate \(\langle \sigma_x \rangle\) by expanding the terms:
     \[
     \langle \sigma_x \rangle = \left(0.5\langle\uparrow| + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\langle\downarrow|\right) \sigma_x \left(0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle\right)
     \]
   - the non-zero terms are:
     \[
     \langle\uparrow|\sigma_x|\downarrow\rangle = \langle\downarrow|\sigma_x|\uparrow\rangle = 1
     \]
   - therefore:
     \[
     \langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \times \left(0.5 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866
     \]

3. **combine the results**:
   - the expectation value of the operator \(10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x\) is:
     \[
     10 \langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5 \langle \sigma_x \rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)
     \]
   - substituting the values:
     \[
     10(-0.5) + 5 \times 0.866 = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67
     \]
   - rounded to one decimal place, this is \(-0.7\).

thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{c}\)
