Okay, so I have this problem about a meson resonance X, and I need to find its mean decay distance.
The given information is the production energy E_X is 8 GeV, the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV.
The answer choices are in scientific notation with exponents of 10^-16 and 10^-15 meters.
First, I need to recall what the mean decay distance is.
From what I remember, the mean decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle.
The formula for the lifetime τ is given by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which states that τ is approximately ħ / Γ, where Γ is the width of the resonance.
Once I have the lifetime, the mean decay distance can be calculated by multiplying the lifetime by the speed at which the particle is traveling.
Since the particle is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, we can approximate this speed as c.
So the formula would be mean decay distance ≈ τ * c = (ħ / Γ) * c.
But wait, I need to make sure if this is correct.
Let me verify.
The Heisenberg uncertainty relation for energy and time is ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2.
For resonances, the uncertainty in energy ΔE is related to the width Γ, so ΔE ≈ Γ.
Therefore, the uncertainty in time Δt ≈ ħ / Γ.
This uncertainty in time is related to the lifetime of the particle.
So yes, the lifetime τ is approximately ħ / Γ.
Then, the mean decay distance would be the lifetime multiplied by the speed.
So that's (ħ / Γ) * βc, where β is the velocity divided by c.
But wait, in the problem, is the production energy given?
That might be used to find the velocity of the particle.
Because the mean decay distance depends on how fast the particle is moving.
So I need to compute the velocity of the meson X.
Given that the production energy E_X is 8 GeV, the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, so it's a relativistic particle because the kinetic energy is much larger than its rest mass energy.
So I need to calculate its speed βc.
Let's think in parallel.

2: The rest mass energy of the meson, calculated as m_X*c^2, is 1.2 GeV.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The total energy of the meson is 8 GeV, and its rest mass energy is 1.2 GeV.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Then, the kinetic energy is E - m_X c^2 = 8 - 1.2 = 6.8 GeV.
To find the velocity β, maybe I can use the relation between total energy, rest mass energy, and kinetic energy in special relativity.
The total energy E is γ m c^2, where γ is the Lorentz factor.
So γ = E / (m c^2) = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666...
So γ is approximately 6.666, or 20/3.
Then, since γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β^2), we can solve for β.
But maybe there's a quicker way.
Alternatively, we can use the relation:
β = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4 / E^2))
Wait, let's see.
Since E = γ m c^2, then:
β = v/c = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4 / E^2)) ?
Let me check that formula.
Starting from γ = E / (m c^2).
Then, since γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β^2), we can write:
1 / γ = sqrt(1 - β^2)
So,
sqrt(1 - β^2) = m c^2 / E
Square both sides:
1 - β^2 = m^2 c^4 / E^2
Therefore,
β^2 = 1 - (m^2 c^4 / E^2)
Therefore,
β = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4 / E^2))
Yes, that's the correct formula.
Therefore, we can compute β as:
β = sqrt(1 - (m^2 / E^2)) * c^2 ?
Wait, let's check the units here.
Wait, m is in GeV (if we are using units where c=1, which we often do in particle physics).
But when considering the actual expression with c, m c^2 is in GeV, so E is also in GeV.
Therefore, m^2 c^4 / E^2 would be (GeV)^2 / (GeV)^2 = 1, so that's okay.
Therefore, β = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4 / (E^2))) = sqrt(1 - (m^2 / E^2)) if we set c=1 in the earlier units.
But in any case, given that E is 8 GeV and m is 1.2 GeV, then:
β = sqrt(1 - ( (1.2)^2 / (8)^2 )) = sqrt(1 - (1.44 / 64)) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775)
Compute 0.9775 square root.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>

</Path>
<Conclusion>
The square root of 0.9775 was identified, and its approximate value was determined to be 0.9887.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So β ≈ 0.9887.
Therefore, the speed βc is approximately 0.9887c.
Now, let's compute c multiplied by β:
Approximately, 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s = ?
But maybe we can keep it in terms of β for now.
Next step is to compute the lifetime τ.
The lifetime τ is approximately ħ / Γ.
But we need to make sure of the units here.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: The lifetime (τ) of the resonance X.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: The mean decay distance (βc * τ) using the calculated lifetime and speed.

</Goal>
<Path>
1: The formula for the lifetime τ is τ ≈ ħ / Γ. The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-27 erg·s. The width Γ_X is given as 320 MeV, which is equivalent to 0.32 GeV. The lifetime τ is calculated as (1.0545718 × 10^-27 erg·s) / (0.32 GeV).
The energy unit GeV must be converted into erg.
The conversion factor 1 GeV = 1.60218 × 10^-7 erg is used.
The denominator Γ_X in erg is 0.32 GeV * 1.60218 × 10^-7 erg/GeV = 5.127 × 10^-8 erg.
The lifetime τ is then (1.0545718 × 10^-27 erg·s) / (5.127 × 10^-8 erg) ≈ 2.057 × 10^-20 seconds.
The lifetime τ is approximately 2.057 × 10^-20 s.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The mean decay distance is calculated as βc * τ, which is (0.9887 * 3e8 m/s) * (5.5556e-24 s). The product of 0.9887 and 3e8 m/s is approximately 2.9661e8 m/s. Multiplying this speed by the lifetime of 5.5556e-24 s results in a distance of 2.9661e8 m/s * 5.5556e-24 s, which is approximately 1.6476e-15 meters.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The calculated lifetime (τ) is approximately 2.057 × 10^-20 seconds, and the corresponding mean decay distance (βc * τ) is approximately 1.6476 × 10^-15 meters.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Wait, but this gives approximately 1.6e-15 meters, which is not matching any of the answer options.
The answer options are around 4e-16 or 5e-16 m (options A and B) or 10x larger (C and D).
So something is wrong here.
Maybe I made a miscalculation.
Let me check step by step.
First, let's recast all the steps with proper units to make sure.
Given:
E_X = 8 GeV (total energy)
m_X = 1.2 GeV/c2 (mass)
Γ_X = 320 MeV (width), which is 0.32 GeV
We need to compute the mean decay distance.
First, calculate the lifetime τ ≈ ħ / Γ.
Using ħ = 1.0545718e-27 erg·s.
But let's convert Γ into energy in erg.
1 GeV = 1.60218e-7 erg.
So Γ_X = 0.32 GeV = 0.32 * 1.60218e-7 erg = 5.127e-8 erg.
Then τ = ħ / Γ = (1.0545718e-27 erg·s) / (5.127e-8 erg) = 2.057e-20 s.
This part seems correct.
Then, compute β.
As earlier, β = sqrt(1 - (m^2 / E^2)).
Let's compute m^2 / E^2:
m = 1.2 GeV, E = 8 GeV.
So (1.2)^2 / (8)^2 = 1.44 / 64 = 0.0225.
Then, β = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887, as before.
Then, compute βc.
Speed of light c = 3e8 m/s.
So βc = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.
Multiply this by τ:
2.966e8 m/s * 2.057e-20 s ≈ 2.966e8 * 2.057e-20 = (2.966 * 2.057) * 10^(8-20) = 6.10 * 10^-12 m ?
Wait, 10^(8 - 20) is 10^-12.
Wait, that can't be right.
Wait, 2.966e8 * 2.057e-20 is equal to 2.966 * 2.057 * 1e8 * 1e-20 = 6.11 * 1e-12 m, which is 6.11e-12 meters.
That's a picometer scale.
But the answer options are 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters.
So this is many orders of magnitude off.
There must be a mistake in the approach.
Wait a minute.
Maybe I used the total energy instead of the momentum to calculate β?
Let me think.
Wait, no.
In relativistic mechanics, the total energy E is given by E = γ m c2, and the momentum p is γ m v.
So if we have E and m, we can compute γ, and then β = v / c.
Alternatively, another formula for β is:
β = E p / (E2 - m2 c^4)
Wait, let's see.
The product E p = γ m c^2 * γ m β c = γ2 m2 β c^3.
Wait, not sure.
Alternatively, perhaps a better approach.
Since E = γ m c^2 and p = γ m v, then (E / c)^2 - p2 = (γ m c)^2 - (γ m v)^2 = γ2 m2 (c2 - v2) = γ2 m2 c2 (1 - v2/c2) = γ2 m2 c2 (1/γ2) = m2 c^4.
Therefore, (E)^2 - (p c)^2 = m2 c^4.
Therefore, if we can compute p from E and m, then we can get β.
Since E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV/c2, then:
p = sqrt(E2 - m2 c^4)/c
Wait, units.
Let me be careful.
If E is in GeV, then (E)^2 is (GeV)^2.
m is in GeV/c2, so (m c2) is in GeV.
Therefore, (E)^2 - (m c^2)^2 = (8 GeV)^2 - (1.2 GeV)^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 (GeV)^2.
Then, p c = sqrt(E2 - (m c2)^2) = sqrt(62.56) GeV ≈ 7.91 GeV.
Therefore, p = 7.91 GeV/c.
Then, the momentum p = γ m v.
But since we have p = γ m β c, so we can write:
β = p c / (γ m c^2) = (p c) / E.
So substituting the values:
β = (7.91 GeV/c * c) / 8 GeV = 7.91 /8 ≈ 0.98875.
Which is the same result as before.
So that's correct.
So β is approximately 0.98875, so speed is 0.98875c.
So that part is correct.
So the speed is roughly 0.9887 times 3e8 m/s.
So the lifetime calculation: τ = ħ / Γ.
Let me check the units again.
Gamma is 0.32 GeV.
So converting GeV to Hz * h, but maybe the issue is in the conversion of energy to inverse time.
Alternatively, sometimes in natural units, people set ħ = 1, so the width Γ has units of energy, and the lifetime is 1/(Γ).
But if we want to convert that into seconds, we need to divide by 1/ħ.
Wait, τ = ħ / Γ.
So to convert Γ from GeV to seconds, we can use E = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / E.
The conversion factor between energy and time is ħ.
So 1 second = ħ / (1 GeV) ≈ 1.0545718e-27 erg·s / (1.60218e-7 erg) ≈ 6.58211956e-27 J·s / (1.60218e-10 J) ) ?
Wait, no.
Let me compute 1 GeV = 1.60218e-7 erg.
So, ħ = 1.0545718e-27 erg·s.
Therefore, τ (s) = (1.0545718e-27 erg·s) / (Γ in erg).
Since Γ in GeV is 0.32, and 1 GeV = 1.60218e-7 erg, Γ = 0.32 * 1.60218e-7 erg = 5.127e-8 erg.
Then τ = 1.0545718e-27 / 5.127e-8 ≈ 2.057e-20 s.
This seems correct.
So τ ≈ 2.057e-20 seconds.
Then multiplying by βc:
βc ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.
So decay distance = τ * βc ≈ 2.057e-20 s * 2.966e8 m/s ≈ 6.098e-12 meters, which is 6.1e-12 m, or 6.1 picometers.
But the answer choices are in the range of 10^-15 to 10^-16 m.
So there's a discrepancy of about 10^3 times.
So my result is 6e-12 m, but the options are 1e-15 to 5e-16 m.
So clearly, I made a mistake.
Where did I go wrong?
Wait, maybe the formula for mean decay distance is different?
Is the mean decay distance related to the lifetime times the speed, or is there another factor?
Wait, perhaps the problem is that the particle is moving in the lab frame, and the lifetime is measured in the particle's rest frame.
So we need to account for time dilation.
Wait, no.
The lifetime in the lab frame is γ τ, not τ.
But in this case, the production energy is given, so the particle is produced with high energy, moving at relativistic speed, so its lifetime would be dilated.
But the formula for mean decay distance is (lifetime in lab frame) * (speed in lab frame).
So lifetime in lab frame is γ τ, where τ is the proper lifetime (lifetime in particle's rest frame).
Wait, now I remember.
The lifetime measured in the lab frame is indeed longer due to time dilation.
So if the proper lifetime is τ (in the rest frame of the particle), then in the lab frame the lifetime is γ τ.
However, in our calculation, we got the lifetime from the Heisenberg uncertainty principle as τ = ħ / Γ.
Is this the proper lifetime or the lab lifetime?
The width Γ is the energy width in the rest frame, I believe.
So the proper lifetime τ is ħ / Γ.
Therefore, in the lab frame, the lifetime would be γ τ.
Then the mean decay distance is β γ τ c.
Wait, that's different.
So if we have to consider time dilation, then the lifetime in the lab frame is γ τ, so the mean decay distance is β γ τ c.
Wait, let's think again.
The uncertainty principle gives the proper lifetime τ = ħ / Γ.
But when the particle is moving, we need to consider its lifetime in the lab frame, which is γ τ.
So then the mean decay distance is γ τ β c.
So then, including γ, multiplying by gamma.
But earlier, when we computed β, we actually used the formula for β in the lab frame, but wait, maybe there's confusion between relativistic parameters.
Wait, perhaps I need to compute the mean decay distance in the lab frame.
So the formula should be:
mean decay distance = (lifetime in lab frame) * (speed in lab frame)
= γ * (proper lifetime τ) * β c
= γ β c τ
Since τ is proper lifetime = ħ / Γ
Therefore, mean decay distance = γ β c τ = γ β c (ħ / Γ)
But now, do we have expressions for γ, β, and so on.
Let me see.
But now this includes γ, which we need to compute.
Earlier, I computed β from the total energy and mass.
Let me verify.
Given that E is the total energy in the lab frame, E = γ m c^2.
So γ = E / (m c^2) = 8 GeV / (1.2 GeV) = 6.666...
So γ is approximately 20/3 ≈ 6.6667.
Then, β as we calculated earlier is sqrt(1 - 1/γ2) since γ = 20/3, so 1/γ2 = 9/400.
Then 1 - 9/400 = 391/400, so sqrt(391/400) ≈ sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887, which is the same as before.
So γ is approximately 6.6667, β ≈0.9887.
Therefore, in the lab frame, the lifetime is γ τ.
So:
decay distance = γ τ β c
Substituting τ = ħ / Γ, so:
decay distance = γ * (ħ / Γ) * β c
Therefore, plugging in the numbers:
γ = 20/3 ≈6.6667
ħ = 1.0545718e-27 erg·s
Γ =0.32 GeV = 0.32 * 1.60218e-7 erg ≈5.127e-8 erg
β ≈0.9887
c ≈3e8 m/s
Calculating step by step:
First, compute ħ / Γ:
1.0545718e-27 erg·s / 5.127e-8 erg ≈2.057e-20 s
Multiply by γ: 2.057e-20 s * 6.6667 ≈1.371e-19 s
Multiply by β c: 1.371e-19 s * 0.9887 *3e8 m/s
Compute 1.371e-19 * 0.9887 ≈1.353e-19
Then *3e8 = 4.059e-11 meters.
Still, 4e-11 meters is 40 millionths of a meter, which is 4e-5 m, or 4 centimeters.
The answer choices are way smaller.
This is clearly wrong.
So there must be a fundamental error in the approach.
Wait, maybe the problem is using natural units where ħ = 1, c=1, and so the formulas simplify.
But translating back to SI units can be tricky.
Wait, let's try using natural units where ħ = 1, c =1.
Then, the lifetime τ = ħ / Γ ≈ 1 / Γ in natural units.
But converting that to seconds, we need to multiply by ħ.
So τ = (1.0545718e-27 erg·s) / (Γ in energy).
But Γ is given in GeV.
So need to convert GeV to energy in erg.
1 GeV =1.60218e-7 erg.
So τ = 1.0545718e-27 s / (0.32 * 1.60218e-7) ≈ same as before, 2.057e-20 s.
Then, in natural units, velocity β is dimensionless.
But in the mean decay distance, if c=1, then distance = τ * β.
But when we convert back to meters, since in natural units c=1, the distance is τ * β * c.
So c in natural units is 1 light-second per second.
So to convert τ to seconds and multiply by c (which is 3e8 m/s), then we get meters.
So τ is 2.057e-20 s.
But we have to multiply by β and c.
So as before, 2.057e-20 s * β * c.
But in natural units, c=1, so the formula would be τ * β.
But translating to meters, multiply by 3e8 m/s.
So same as previous.
Wait, maybe the problem is that the width Γ is related to the inverse of the lifetime, but in natural units Γ is equivalent to 1/τ.
So Γ = 1/τ, hence τ = 1/Γ.
But if we use that, then in SI units, Γ is in Hz (1/seconds), but Γ is given in energy (GeV).
So we need to use τ = ħ / Γ.
Yes.
Because E = ħ / τ.
So τ = ħ / E.
So if Γ is given in GeV, which is an energy, then τ (in seconds) is ħ (in J·s) divided by Γ (in J).
Since 1 GeV = 1.60218e-10 J.
So Γ in J = 0.32 GeV * 1.60218e-10 J/GeV ≈5.127e-10 J.
Then τ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s / 5.127e-10 J ≈2.057e-25 s.
Wait, wait.
Now this is different.
Before, I converted using erg, now in J.
So let's check:
ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.
Γ is 0.32 GeV.
1 GeV = 1.60218e-10 J.
So Γ =0.32 *1.60218e-10 =5.127e-11 J.
Then τ = ħ / Γ =1.0545718e-34 J·s /5.127e-11 J ≈2.057e-24 s.
Wait, this is different from earlier.
Wait, using erg, I got 2.057e-20 s, but using J, I get 2.057e-24 s.
There's a factor of 1e4 difference because 1 erg = 1e-7 J.
So when converting Γ in GeV to erg versus Joules.
So which is correct?
The correct conversion is:
1 GeV = 1.60218e-10 J
1 GeV = 1.60218e-7 erg
So, in the previous calculation in erg:
Γ =0.32 GeV =0.32 *1.60218e-7 erg =5.127e-8 erg
ħ =1.0545718e-27 erg·s
Thus τ = ħ / Γ =1.0545718e-27 /5.127e-8 ≈2.057e-20 s.
In SI units:
Γ =0.32 GeV =0.32 *1.60218e-10 J ≈5.127e-11 J
ħ =1.0545718e-34 J·s
τ = ħ / Γ =1.0545718e-34 /5.127e-11 ≈2.057e-24 s.
So that's 2.057e-24 seconds.
So the lifetime is four orders of magnitude smaller in SI units compared to the erg calculation.
But why the discrepancy?
Wait, this must be due to inconsistent units.
If I compute τ in both erg and SI and get different results, that's a problem.
So what's the correct approach?
The issue arises from unit conversions.
Let's do this properly.
Let's stick to SI units.
Given:
Γ_X = 320 MeV = 320 *1e6 *1.60218e-10 J =320 *1.60218e-4 J=5.127e-2 J.
Wait, no, 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.
Let's start over.
1 eV = 1.60218e-19 J.
So 1 MeV = 1e6 eV =1.60218e-13 J.
1 GeV = 1e9 eV =1.60218e-10 J.
Therefore, Γ_X =320 MeV =320 *1e6 eV =320 *1.60218e-13 J=5.127e-11 J.
Okay.
Then ħ is Planck's constant over 2π: ħ =1.0545718e-34 J·s.
So the lifetime τ = ħ / Γ =1.0545718e-34 J·s /5.127e-11 J≈2.057e-24 s.
So τ ≈2.057e-24 seconds.
Then, we need to compute the speed βc.
The particle's total energy is 8 GeV.
Mass is 1.2 GeV/c2.
So we need to compute β.
Let's compute γ first.
γ = E / (m c2) =8 GeV /1.2 GeV ≈6.6667.
Then, β is sqrt(1 - (1/γ)^2):
sqrt(1 - (1/6.6667)^2)=sqrt(1 -0.0225)=sqrt(0.9775)=0.9887.
Then, βc=0.9887 *3e8 m/s≈2.966e8 m/s.
Then, mean decay distance = βc * τ =2.966e8 m/s *2.057e-24 s≈6.098e-16 meters.
Which is approximately6.1e-16 meters.
Looking at the answer choices, A) 5.0223 *10^-16 m, B)4.0655 *10^-16 m, C) same but 1e-15, D) similar.
So 6.1e-16 m is not among the choices.
Hmm.
But wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculation.
Let's double-check the calculation of τ.
Gamma =0.32 GeV =0.32 *1.60218e-10 J=5.127e-11 J.
Then τ=1.0545718e-34 /5.127e-11≈(1.0545718 /5.127) *1e-23 s≈0.2057 *1e-23=2.057e-24 s.
Then βc=0.9887*3e8≈2.966e8 m/s.
Multiplying τ * βc:2.966e8 *2.057e-24=2.966*2.057 *1e-16.
Calculate 2.966*2.057.
Approximately, 3*2.057=6.171, minus 0.034*2.057≈0.069.
So approx 6.171 -0.069≈6.102.
So 6.102e-16 m, which is approximately6.1e-16 m.
But the answer options do not have this.
The closest is option A)5.0223e-16 m or B)4.0655e-16 m.
So perhaps my approach is wrong.
Wait, maybe there's a different formula.
Alternatively, maybe the production energy is not the total energy but the kinetic energy.
If that's the case, then E = kinetic energy + rest mass energy.
So if the problem states production energy is 8 GeV, is that the total energy or just the kinetic energy?
Let me check the problem statement again.
"The production energy is E_X=8GeV".
In particle physics, production energy usually refers to the kinetic energy.
For example, in collider experiments, they mention the center-of-mass energy.
But here, it's the energy of the meson X.
Wait, the total energy of a particle is kinetic plus rest mass energy.
If the problem says the production energy is 8 GeV, that could be the total energy.
But perhaps sometimes production energy is taken as the kinetic energy.
If that's the case, then the total energy E = K + m =8 GeV +1.2 GeV=9.2 GeV.
But that would affect the calculation.
Wait, but the problem says "production energy", which is probably the total energy.
But maybe in the context in which the user is studying, it's kinetic energy.
But without further information, it's hard to tell.
However, since the mass is 1.2 GeV and the given energy is 8 GeV, if the production energy is total energy, then the calculation we did earlier is correct.
If production energy is kinetic energy, then total energy is 8 +1.2 =9.2 GeV.
Let's see if recalculating with E=9.2 GeV gives one of the answer options.
Let's think in parallel.

1: If the production energy is interpreted as kinetic energy, the total energy E is the sum of kinetic energy (K = 8 GeV) and rest mass energy (m*c^2 = 1.2 GeV), resulting in E = 9.2 GeV. The Lorentz factor γ is then calculated as E divided by m*c^2, which is 9.2 GeV / 1.2 GeV, resulting in γ = 7.6667. The velocity parameter β is found using the formula sqrt(1 - (1/γ^2)), yielding sqrt(1 - (1/7.6667^2)) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.0181) ≈ sqrt(0.9819) ≈ 0.9909. The lifetime τ is calculated as ħ / Γ, which is (1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s) / (0.32 GeV * 1.60218 × 10^-10 J/GeV) ≈ (1.0545718 × 10^-34) / (5.127 × 10^-11) ≈ 2.057 × 10^-24 s. The speed βc is approximated as 0.9909 * 3 × 10^8 m/s ≈ 2.9727 × 10^8 m/s. The mean decay distance is then τ multiplied by βc, calculated as 2.057 × 10^-24 s * 2.9727 × 10^8 m/s ≈ 6.12 × 10^-16 m.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is supposed to use the approximate relation for ultrarelativistic particles.
For highly relativistic particles, γ ≈ E / (m c2) ≈ E / m (if c=1 units).
Then, β ≈1, so v ≈c.
So then, lifetime in lab frame

okay, so i have this problem about a meson resonance x, and i need to find its mean decay distance.
the given information is the production energy e_x is 8 gev, the mass m_x is 1.2 gev, and the width γ_x is 320 mev.
the answer choices are in scientific notation with exponents of 10^-16 and 10^-15 meters.
first, i need to recall what the mean decay distance is.
from what i remember, the mean decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle.
the formula for the lifetime τ is given by the heisenberg uncertainty principle, which states that τ is approximately ħ / γ, where γ is the width of the resonance.
once i have the lifetime, the mean decay distance can be calculated by multiplying the lifetime by the speed at which the particle is traveling.
since the particle is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, we can approximate this speed as c.
so the formula would be mean decay distance ≈ τ * c = (ħ / γ) * c.
but wait, i need to make sure if this is correct.
let me verify.
the heisenberg uncertainty relation for energy and time is δe * δt ≥ ħ/2.
for resonances, the uncertainty in energy δe is related to the width γ, so δe ≈ γ.
therefore, the uncertainty in time δt ≈ ħ / γ.
this uncertainty in time is related to the lifetime of the particle.
so yes, the lifetime τ is approximately ħ / γ.
then, the mean decay distance would be the lifetime multiplied by the speed.
so that's (ħ / γ) * βc, where β is the velocity divided by c.
but wait, in the problem, is the production energy given?
that might be used to find the velocity of the particle.
because the mean decay distance depends on how fast the particle is moving.
so i need to compute the velocity of the meson x.
given that the production energy e_x is 8 gev, the mass m_x is 1.2 gev, so it's a relativistic particle because the kinetic energy is much larger than its rest mass energy.
so i need to calculate its speed βc.
let's think in parallel.

</path>
<conclusion>
the total energy of the meson is 8 gev, and its rest mass energy is 1.2 gev.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
then, the kinetic energy is e - m_x c^2 = 8 - 1.2 = 6.8 gev.
to find the velocity β, maybe i can use the relation between total energy, rest mass energy, and kinetic energy in special relativity.
the total energy e is γ m c^2, where γ is the lorentz factor.
so γ = e / (m c^2) = 8 gev / 1.2 gev = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666...
so γ is approximately 6.666, or 20/3.
then, since γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β^2), we can solve for β.
but maybe there's a quicker way.
alternatively, we can use the relation:
β = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4 / e^2))
wait, let's see.
since e = γ m c^2, then:
β = v/c = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4 / e^2)) ?
let me check that formula.
starting from γ = e / (m c^2).
then, since γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β^2), we can write:
1 / γ = sqrt(1 - β^2)
so,
sqrt(1 - β^2) = m c^2 / e
square both sides:
1 - β^2 = m^2 c^4 / e^2
therefore,
β^2 = 1 - (m^2 c^4 / e^2)
therefore,
β = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4 / e^2))
yes, that's the correct formula.
therefore, we can compute β as:
β = sqrt(1 - (m^2 / e^2)) * c^2 ?
wait, let's check the units here.
wait, m is in gev (if we are using units where c=1, which we often do in particle physics).
but when considering the actual expression with c, m c^2 is in gev, so e is also in gev.
therefore, m^2 c^4 / e^2 would be (gev)^2 / (gev)^2 = 1, so that's okay.
therefore, β = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4 / (e^2))) = sqrt(1 - (m^2 / e^2)) if we set c=1 in the earlier units.
but in any case, given that e is 8 gev and m is 1.2 gev, then:
β = sqrt(1 - ( (1.2)^2 / (8)^2 )) = sqrt(1 - (1.44 / 64)) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775)
compute 0.9775 square root.
let's think in parallel.

<conclusion>
the square root of 0.9775 was identified, and its approximate value was determined to be 0.9887.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
so β ≈ 0.9887.
therefore, the speed βc is approximately 0.9887c.
now, let's compute c multiplied by β:
approximately, 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s = ?
but maybe we can keep it in terms of β for now.
next step is to compute the lifetime τ.
the lifetime τ is approximately ħ / γ.
but we need to make sure of the units here.
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>

2: the mean decay distance (βc * τ) using the calculated lifetime and speed.

<path>
1: the formula for the lifetime τ is τ ≈ ħ / γ. the reduced planck constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-27 erg·s. the width γ_x is given as 320 mev, which is equivalent to 0.32 gev. the lifetime τ is calculated as (1.0545718 × 10^-27 erg·s) / (0.32 gev).
the energy unit gev must be converted into erg.
the conversion factor 1 gev = 1.60218 × 10^-7 erg is used.
the denominator γ_x in erg is 0.32 gev * 1.60218 × 10^-7 erg/gev = 5.127 × 10^-8 erg.
the lifetime τ is then (1.0545718 × 10^-27 erg·s) / (5.127 × 10^-8 erg) ≈ 2.057 × 10^-20 seconds.
the lifetime τ is approximately 2.057 × 10^-20 s.
</path>
<path>
2: the mean decay distance is calculated as βc * τ, which is (0.9887 * 3e8 m/s) * (5.5556e-24 s). the product of 0.9887 and 3e8 m/s is approximately 2.9661e8 m/s. multiplying this speed by the lifetime of 5.5556e-24 s results in a distance of 2.9661e8 m/s * 5.5556e-24 s, which is approximately 1.6476e-15 meters.
</path>
<conclusion>
the calculated lifetime (τ) is approximately 2.057 × 10^-20 seconds, and the corresponding mean decay distance (βc * τ) is approximately 1.6476 × 10^-15 meters.
</conclusion>

wait, but this gives approximately 1.6e-15 meters, which is not matching any of the answer options.
the answer options are around 4e-16 or 5e-16 m (options a and b) or 10x larger (c and d).
so something is wrong here.
maybe i made a miscalculation.
let me check step by step.
first, let's recast all the steps with proper units to make sure.
given:
e_x = 8 gev (total energy)
m_x = 1.2 gev/c2 (mass)
γ_x = 320 mev (width), which is 0.32 gev
we need to compute the mean decay distance.
first, calculate the lifetime τ ≈ ħ / γ.
using ħ = 1.0545718e-27 erg·s.
but let's convert γ into energy in erg.
1 gev = 1.60218e-7 erg.
so γ_x = 0.32 gev = 0.32 * 1.60218e-7 erg = 5.127e-8 erg.
then τ = ħ / γ = (1.0545718e-27 erg·s) / (5.127e-8 erg) = 2.057e-20 s.
this part seems correct.
then, compute β.
as earlier, β = sqrt(1 - (m^2 / e^2)).
let's compute m^2 / e^2:
m = 1.2 gev, e = 8 gev.
so (1.2)^2 / (8)^2 = 1.44 / 64 = 0.0225.
then, β = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887, as before.
then, compute βc.
speed of light c = 3e8 m/s.
so βc = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.
multiply this by τ:
2.966e8 m/s * 2.057e-20 s ≈ 2.966e8 * 2.057e-20 = (2.966 * 2.057) * 10^(8-20) = 6.10 * 10^-12 m ?
wait, 10^(8 - 20) is 10^-12.
wait, that can't be right.
wait, 2.966e8 * 2.057e-20 is equal to 2.966 * 2.057 * 1e8 * 1e-20 = 6.11 * 1e-12 m, which is 6.11e-12 meters.
that's a picometer scale.
but the answer options are 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters.
so this is many orders of magnitude off.
there must be a mistake in the approach.
wait a minute.
maybe i used the total energy instead of the momentum to calculate β?
let me think.
wait, no.
in relativistic mechanics, the total energy e is given by e = γ m c2, and the momentum p is γ m v.
so if we have e and m, we can compute γ, and then β = v / c.
alternatively, another formula for β is:
β = e p / (e2 - m2 c^4)
wait, let's see.
the product e p = γ m c^2 * γ m β c = γ2 m2 β c^3.
wait, not sure.
alternatively, perhaps a better approach.
since e = γ m c^2 and p = γ m v, then (e / c)^2 - p2 = (γ m c)^2 - (γ m v)^2 = γ2 m2 (c2 - v2) = γ2 m2 c2 (1 - v2/c2) = γ2 m2 c2 (1/γ2) = m2 c^4.
therefore, (e)^2 - (p c)^2 = m2 c^4.
therefore, if we can compute p from e and m, then we can get β.
since e = 8 gev, m = 1.2 gev/c2, then:
p = sqrt(e2 - m2 c^4)/c
wait, units.
let me be careful.
if e is in gev, then (e)^2 is (gev)^2.
m is in gev/c2, so (m c2) is in gev.
therefore, (e)^2 - (m c^2)^2 = (8 gev)^2 - (1.2 gev)^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 (gev)^2.
then, p c = sqrt(e2 - (m c2)^2) = sqrt(62.56) gev ≈ 7.91 gev.
therefore, p = 7.91 gev/c.
then, the momentum p = γ m v.
but since we have p = γ m β c, so we can write:
β = p c / (γ m c^2) = (p c) / e.
so substituting the values:
β = (7.91 gev/c * c) / 8 gev = 7.91 /8 ≈ 0.98875.
which is the same result as before.
so that's correct.
so β is approximately 0.98875, so speed is 0.98875c.
so that part is correct.
so the speed is roughly 0.9887 times 3e8 m/s.
so the lifetime calculation: τ = ħ / γ.
let me check the units again.
gamma is 0.32 gev.
so converting gev to hz * h, but maybe the issue is in the conversion of energy to inverse time.
alternatively, sometimes in natural units, people set ħ = 1, so the width γ has units of energy, and the lifetime is 1/(γ).
but if we want to convert that into seconds, we need to divide by 1/ħ.
wait, τ = ħ / γ.
so to convert γ from gev to seconds, we can use e = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / e.
the conversion factor between energy and time is ħ.
so 1 second = ħ / (1 gev) ≈ 1.0545718e-27 erg·s / (1.60218e-7 erg) ≈ 6.58211956e-27 j·s / (1.60218e-10 j) ) ?
wait, no.
let me compute 1 gev = 1.60218e-7 erg.
so, ħ = 1.0545718e-27 erg·s.
therefore, τ (s) = (1.0545718e-27 erg·s) / (γ in erg).
since γ in gev is 0.32, and 1 gev = 1.60218e-7 erg, γ = 0.32 * 1.60218e-7 erg = 5.127e-8 erg.
then τ = 1.0545718e-27 / 5.127e-8 ≈ 2.057e-20 s.
this seems correct.
so τ ≈ 2.057e-20 seconds.
then multiplying by βc:
βc ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.
so decay distance = τ * βc ≈ 2.057e-20 s * 2.966e8 m/s ≈ 6.098e-12 meters, which is 6.1e-12 m, or 6.1 picometers.
but the answer choices are in the range of 10^-15 to 10^-16 m.
so there's a discrepancy of about 10^3 times.
so my result is 6e-12 m, but the options are 1e-15 to 5e-16 m.
so clearly, i made a mistake.
where did i go wrong?
wait, maybe the formula for mean decay distance is different?
is the mean decay distance related to the lifetime times the speed, or is there another factor?
wait, perhaps the problem is that the particle is moving in the lab frame, and the lifetime is measured in the particle's rest frame.
so we need to account for time dilation.
wait, no.
the lifetime in the lab frame is γ τ, not τ.
but in this case, the production energy is given, so the particle is produced with high energy, moving at relativistic speed, so its lifetime would be dilated.
but the formula for mean decay distance is (lifetime in lab frame) * (speed in lab frame).
so lifetime in lab frame is γ τ, where τ is the proper lifetime (lifetime in particle's rest frame).
wait, now i remember.
the lifetime measured in the lab frame is indeed longer due to time dilation.
so if the proper lifetime is τ (in the rest frame of the particle), then in the lab frame the lifetime is γ τ.
however, in our calculation, we got the lifetime from the heisenberg uncertainty principle as τ = ħ / γ.
is this the proper lifetime or the lab lifetime?
the width γ is the energy width in the rest frame, i believe.
so the proper lifetime τ is ħ / γ.
therefore, in the lab frame, the lifetime would be γ τ.
then the mean decay distance is β γ τ c.
wait, that's different.
so if we have to consider time dilation, then the lifetime in the lab frame is γ τ, so the mean decay distance is β γ τ c.
wait, let's think again.
the uncertainty principle gives the proper lifetime τ = ħ / γ.
but when the particle is moving, we need to consider its lifetime in the lab frame, which is γ τ.
so then the mean decay distance is γ τ β c.
so then, including γ, multiplying by gamma.
but earlier, when we computed β, we actually used the formula for β in the lab frame, but wait, maybe there's confusion between relativistic parameters.
wait, perhaps i need to compute the mean decay distance in the lab frame.
so the formula should be:
mean decay distance = (lifetime in lab frame) * (speed in lab frame)
= γ * (proper lifetime τ) * β c
= γ β c τ
since τ is proper lifetime = ħ / γ
therefore, mean decay distance = γ β c τ = γ β c (ħ / γ)
but now, do we have expressions for γ, β, and so on.
let me see.
but now this includes γ, which we need to compute.
earlier, i computed β from the total energy and mass.
let me verify.
given that e is the total energy in the lab frame, e = γ m c^2.
so γ = e / (m c^2) = 8 gev / (1.2 gev) = 6.666...
so γ is approximately 20/3 ≈ 6.6667.
then, β as we calculated earlier is sqrt(1 - 1/γ2) since γ = 20/3, so 1/γ2 = 9/400.
then 1 - 9/400 = 391/400, so sqrt(391/400) ≈ sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887, which is the same as before.
so γ is approximately 6.6667, β ≈0.9887.
therefore, in the lab frame, the lifetime is γ τ.
so:
decay distance = γ τ β c
substituting τ = ħ / γ, so:
decay distance = γ * (ħ / γ) * β c
therefore, plugging in the numbers:
γ = 20/3 ≈6.6667
ħ = 1.0545718e-27 erg·s
γ =0.32 gev = 0.32 * 1.60218e-7 erg ≈5.127e-8 erg
β ≈0.9887
c ≈3e8 m/s
calculating step by step:
first, compute ħ / γ:
1.0545718e-27 erg·s / 5.127e-8 erg ≈2.057e-20 s
multiply by γ: 2.057e-20 s * 6.6667 ≈1.371e-19 s
multiply by β c: 1.371e-19 s * 0.9887 *3e8 m/s
compute 1.371e-19 * 0.9887 ≈1.353e-19
then *3e8 = 4.059e-11 meters.
still, 4e-11 meters is 40 millionths of a meter, which is 4e-5 m, or 4 centimeters.
the answer choices are way smaller.
this is clearly wrong.
so there must be a fundamental error in the approach.
wait, maybe the problem is using natural units where ħ = 1, c=1, and so the formulas simplify.
but translating back to si units can be tricky.
wait, let's try using natural units where ħ = 1, c =1.
then, the lifetime τ = ħ / γ ≈ 1 / γ in natural units.
but converting that to seconds, we need to multiply by ħ.
so τ = (1.0545718e-27 erg·s) / (γ in energy).
but γ is given in gev.
so need to convert gev to energy in erg.
1 gev =1.60218e-7 erg.
so τ = 1.0545718e-27 s / (0.32 * 1.60218e-7) ≈ same as before, 2.057e-20 s.
then, in natural units, velocity β is dimensionless.
but in the mean decay distance, if c=1, then distance = τ * β.
but when we convert back to meters, since in natural units c=1, the distance is τ * β * c.
so c in natural units is 1 light-second per second.
so to convert τ to seconds and multiply by c (which is 3e8 m/s), then we get meters.
so τ is 2.057e-20 s.
but we have to multiply by β and c.
so as before, 2.057e-20 s * β * c.
but in natural units, c=1, so the formula would be τ * β.
but translating to meters, multiply by 3e8 m/s.
so same as previous.
wait, maybe the problem is that the width γ is related to the inverse of the lifetime, but in natural units γ is equivalent to 1/τ.
so γ = 1/τ, hence τ = 1/γ.
but if we use that, then in si units, γ is in hz (1/seconds), but γ is given in energy (gev).
so we need to use τ = ħ / γ.
yes.
because e = ħ / τ.
so τ = ħ / e.
so if γ is given in gev, which is an energy, then τ (in seconds) is ħ (in j·s) divided by γ (in j).
since 1 gev = 1.60218e-10 j.
so γ in j = 0.32 gev * 1.60218e-10 j/gev ≈5.127e-10 j.
then τ = 1.0545718e-34 j·s / 5.127e-10 j ≈2.057e-25 s.
wait, wait.
now this is different.
before, i converted using erg, now in j.
so let's check:
ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 j·s.
γ is 0.32 gev.
1 gev = 1.60218e-10 j.
so γ =0.32 *1.60218e-10 =5.127e-11 j.
then τ = ħ / γ =1.0545718e-34 j·s /5.127e-11 j ≈2.057e-24 s.
wait, this is different from earlier.
wait, using erg, i got 2.057e-20 s, but using j, i get 2.057e-24 s.
there's a factor of 1e4 difference because 1 erg = 1e-7 j.
so when converting γ in gev to erg versus joules.
so which is correct?
the correct conversion is:
1 gev = 1.60218e-10 j
1 gev = 1.60218e-7 erg
so, in the previous calculation in erg:
γ =0.32 gev =0.32 *1.60218e-7 erg =5.127e-8 erg
ħ =1.0545718e-27 erg·s
thus τ = ħ / γ =1.0545718e-27 /5.127e-8 ≈2.057e-20 s.
in si units:
γ =0.32 gev =0.32 *1.60218e-10 j ≈5.127e-11 j
ħ =1.0545718e-34 j·s
τ = ħ / γ =1.0545718e-34 /5.127e-11 ≈2.057e-24 s.
so that's 2.057e-24 seconds.
so the lifetime is four orders of magnitude smaller in si units compared to the erg calculation.
but why the discrepancy?
wait, this must be due to inconsistent units.
if i compute τ in both erg and si and get different results, that's a problem.
so what's the correct approach?
the issue arises from unit conversions.
let's do this properly.
let's stick to si units.
given:
γ_x = 320 mev = 320 *1e6 *1.60218e-10 j =320 *1.60218e-4 j=5.127e-2 j.
wait, no, 320 mev is 0.32 gev.
let's start over.
1 ev = 1.60218e-19 j.
so 1 mev = 1e6 ev =1.60218e-13 j.
1 gev = 1e9 ev =1.60218e-10 j.
therefore, γ_x =320 mev =320 *1e6 ev =320 *1.60218e-13 j=5.127e-11 j.
okay.
then ħ is planck's constant over 2π: ħ =1.0545718e-34 j·s.
so the lifetime τ = ħ / γ =1.0545718e-34 j·s /5.127e-11 j≈2.057e-24 s.
so τ ≈2.057e-24 seconds.
then, we need to compute the speed βc.
the particle's total energy is 8 gev.
mass is 1.2 gev/c2.
so we need to compute β.
let's compute γ first.
γ = e / (m c2) =8 gev /1.2 gev ≈6.6667.
then, β is sqrt(1 - (1/γ)^2):
sqrt(1 - (1/6.6667)^2)=sqrt(1 -0.0225)=sqrt(0.9775)=0.9887.
then, βc=0.9887 *3e8 m/s≈2.966e8 m/s.
then, mean decay distance = βc * τ =2.966e8 m/s *2.057e-24 s≈6.098e-16 meters.
which is approximately6.1e-16 meters.
looking at the answer choices, a) 5.0223 *10^-16 m, b)4.0655 *10^-16 m, c) same but 1e-15, d) similar.
so 6.1e-16 m is not among the choices.
hmm.
but wait, maybe i made a mistake in calculation.
let's double-check the calculation of τ.
gamma =0.32 gev =0.32 *1.60218e-10 j=5.127e-11 j.
then τ=1.0545718e-34 /5.127e-11≈(1.0545718 /5.127) *1e-23 s≈0.2057 *1e-23=2.057e-24 s.
then βc=0.9887*3e8≈2.966e8 m/s.
multiplying τ * βc:2.966e8 *2.057e-24=2.966*2.057 *1e-16.
calculate 2.966*2.057.
approximately, 3*2.057=6.171, minus 0.034*2.057≈0.069.
so approx 6.171 -0.069≈6.102.
so 6.102e-16 m, which is approximately6.1e-16 m.
but the answer options do not have this.
the closest is option a)5.0223e-16 m or b)4.0655e-16 m.
so perhaps my approach is wrong.
wait, maybe there's a different formula.
alternatively, maybe the production energy is not the total energy but the kinetic energy.
if that's the case, then e = kinetic energy + rest mass energy.
so if the problem states production energy is 8 gev, is that the total energy or just the kinetic energy?
let me check the problem statement again.
"the production energy is e_x=8gev".
in particle physics, production energy usually refers to the kinetic energy.
for example, in collider experiments, they mention the center-of-mass energy.
but here, it's the energy of the meson x.
wait, the total energy of a particle is kinetic plus rest mass energy.
if the problem says the production energy is 8 gev, that could be the total energy.
but perhaps sometimes production energy is taken as the kinetic energy.
if that's the case, then the total energy e = k + m =8 gev +1.2 gev=9.2 gev.
but that would affect the calculation.
wait, but the problem says "production energy", which is probably the total energy.
but maybe in the context in which the user is studying, it's kinetic energy.
but without further information, it's hard to tell.
however, since the mass is 1.2 gev and the given energy is 8 gev, if the production energy is total energy, then the calculation we did earlier is correct.
if production energy is kinetic energy, then total energy is 8 +1.2 =9.2 gev.
let's see if recalculating with e=9.2 gev gives one of the answer options.
let's think in parallel.

1: if the production energy is interpreted as kinetic energy, the total energy e is the sum of kinetic energy (k = 8 gev) and rest mass energy (m*c^2 = 1.2 gev), resulting in e = 9.2 gev. the lorentz factor γ is then calculated as e divided by m*c^2, which is 9.2 gev / 1.2 gev, resulting in γ = 7.6667. the velocity parameter β is found using the formula sqrt(1 - (1/γ^2)), yielding sqrt(1 - (1/7.6667^2)) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.0181) ≈ sqrt(0.9819) ≈ 0.9909. the lifetime τ is calculated as ħ / γ, which is (1.0545718 × 10^-34 j·s) / (0.32 gev * 1.60218 × 10^-10 j/gev) ≈ (1.0545718 × 10^-34) / (5.127 × 10^-11) ≈ 2.057 × 10^-24 s. the speed βc is approximated as 0.9909 * 3 × 10^8 m/s ≈ 2.9727 × 10^8 m/s. the mean decay distance is then τ multiplied by βc, calculated as 2.057 × 10^-24 s * 2.9727 × 10^8 m/s ≈ 6.12 × 10^-16 m. this result is also not among the provided answer options.

<conclusion>
interpreting the production energy as kinetic energy yields a mean decay distance of approximately 6.12 × 10^-16 meters, while interpreting it as total energy yields a distance of approximately 6.098 × 10^-16 meters; neither of these results matches the provided answer options.

wait, perhaps the calculation is supposed to use the approximate relation for ultrarelativistic particles.
for highly relativistic particles, γ ≈ e / (m c2) ≈ e / m (if c=1 units).
then, β ≈1, so v ≈c.
so then, lifetime in lab frame
