Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. It's about isomers and tautomerism, which I need to remember properly. The question has two parts: part A is about identifying which compound does not show tautomerism, and part B is about which compound shows optical isomerism. The answer options combine these choices, so I need to figure out both A and B correctly.

1: Tautomerism involves the reversible interconversion of chemical structures that have the same molecular formula but differ in the connectivity or arrangement of atoms. This phenomenon is exemplified by the keto-enol tautomerism observed in compounds such as acetylacetone. A tautomeric pair includes a keto form, characterized by a carbonyl group, and an enol form, featuring a double bond and a hydroxyl group. The presence of conjugation and the ability to form a six-membered ring transition state facilitate this interconversion.

So maybe neither shows tautomerism? Wait, but the question is to choose between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione for which one does NOT show tautomerism. If neither shows it, then... Hmm. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.
Let me check again. Benzoquinone: two ketone groups on benzene ring. For tautomerism like keto-enol, you need a ketone adjacent to a CH group, right? But in benzoquinone, the ketones are attached directly to the ring. So each carbonyl is attached to a ring carbon. The adjacent groups would be other parts of the ring, which are all bonded in a hexagonal structure. So, there's no CH group adjacent to the carbonyl; adjacent atoms are part of the ring. Therefore, benzoquinone can't undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Similarly, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. Each carbonyl is attached to a ring carbon, and the adjacent groups are other ring carbons. So again, no CH groups adjacent to the carbonyls, hence no keto-enol tautomerism. Wait, so then both don't show tautomerism? Then why in part A, we have to choose which one does NOT show tautomerism. If both don't, then the answer would be either A or D. Wait, maybe I'm missing another type of tautomerism. Are there other types besides keto-enol? Yes. For example, amide-imidic acid tautomerism, but these compounds are not amides. Let's see. Another possibility is hydrogen shifting between different positions. But in benzoquinone, the structure is two carbonyl groups attached to the benzene ring. For tautomerism, you would need a hydrogen to shift from one position to another, converting a double bond or a carbonyl. But since benzoquinone is just a quinone (benzene ring with two ketone groups), without any adjacent CH groups, I don't see how tautomerism can occur. Similarly, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a triketone. Each carbonyl is attached to a different carbon of the cyclohexane ring. Since all adjacent carbons are part of the ring and don't have CH groups, there's no possibility for hydrogen shift. Wait, unless there is some kind of [CH...O] tautomerism? For example, if one of the carbonyl groups could shift by moving a hydrogen from a bridgehead or something. Wait, but the cyclohexane ring is a six-membered ring. If there are three ketone groups, each attached to a carbon, spaced every two positions (1,3,5). Then each ketone is separated by two other carbons. So, the adjacent carbons to each ketone are part of the ring, but maybe not part of a CH group. Wait, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the structure would have carbons 1, 3, and 5 as carbonyls. Then carbons 2,4,6 would be part of the ring. Wait, but each carbonyl is attached to oxygen, so the carbons are double-bonded to oxygen. Then each of those carbons is connected to the oxygen, and the remaining bonds are to the neighboring ring carbons. Therefore, there are no CH groups on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyls. Therefore, no possibility for hydrogen to move. Hence, no tautomerism here. So, in that case, both compounds don't show tautomerism? Then the answer A would be cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione and B would be... Wait, but the answer options need to be selected. Let's look at the options. For part A, the compound that does NOT show tautomerism. If both don't show tautomerism, then either A or D is correct. But according to the answer options, let's check. Option A says A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Option B says A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Option C says A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate. Option D says A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate. So if part A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, then answer choices A and D are possible. If part A is benzoquinone, then B and C are possible. But if both compounds don't exhibit tautomerism, which is the correct answer? Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me re-express benzoquinone's structure. Benzoquinone is para- or ortho- or meta-diquinone. Wait, actually, benzoquinone is 1,4-benzoquinone. So the structure is a benzene ring with carbonyl groups at positions 1 and 4. So, the carbonyls are para to each other. In that case, each carbonyl is attached to a ring carbon, and the adjacent carbons (e.g., positions 2,3,5,6) are part of the ring but not CH groups. Wait, but maybe in conjugated systems there can be some tautomerism. Wait, quinones can undergo some tautomeric shifts? For example, in some cases, quinones can exist in resonance with phenolic forms, but that's resonance, not tautomerism. Tautomerism requires the actual movement of a hydrogen atom and a change in bonding. Alternatively, perhaps in benzoquinone, one of the carbonyl groups could shift by moving a hydrogen, but given that the carbonyls are part of the aromatic ring, I don't see how that's possible without breaking the aromaticity. Wait, maybe the tautomerism isn't that of the carbonyl group but some other group. Wait, perhaps enolization elsewhere. Wait, but there's no adjacent CH group. Alternatively, maybe the benzene ring could become non-aromatic and allow for tautomerism. But that would require breaking the conjugation, which is not favorable. Alternatively, perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, despite being a triketone, can't undergo tautomerism because all the carbonyl groups are fixed. Alternatively, maybe one of them can undergo some kind of tautomeric shift. For instance, if one of the carbonyl groups is part of a five-membered ring or something, but since it's a six-membered cyclohexane ring, with three carbonyls, perhaps it's possible? Wait, if the cyclohexane ring is in a chair conformation, perhaps some of the carbonyl groups are axial or equatorial. However, tautomerism relates to the connectivity, not just the conformation. Alternatively, maybe the cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo some kind of sigmatropic shift, like a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, but that's a rearrangement, not tautomerism. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I should think of another example. For instance, ortho-nitrophenoxide can undergo keto-enol-like tautomerism? Wait, but without a CH group, I don't see how. Alternatively, maybe the cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can lose a hydrogen from one of the bridgehead carbons to form a double bond. Wait, but in a cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups, the remaining carbons would each have two hydrogens. For example, if the ring is 1,3,5-trione, then the structure is O=C1-C2-C3-O-C4-C5-C6-O..., but no, the actual structure is each of the 1,3,5 positions is a carbonyl. Therefore, the ring would have O=C-C-O-C-C-O=C-C-O-C-C=O... No, actually, the cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have the structure where each of the 1,3,5 positions is a carbonyl group. So, in other words, the ring would be O=C6-H2-C1-H2-O-C2-H2-C3-H2-O-C4-H2-C5-H2- but with the 1,3,5 positions as carbonyls. Wait, no. If it's cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, then the carbonyl groups are at positions 1,3,5. So, each of those carbons is part of a carbonyl group (double-bonded to oxygen), and the other positions are single bonds. So, the ring would look like: O=C1-C2-C3-C4-C5-C6-O where the numbering is 1,2,3,4,5,6. But no, that's not possible. Wait, actually, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have three carbonyl groups attached to the cyclohexane ring at positions 1,3,5. Wait, but cyclohexane has six carbons. If you put a carbonyl group at 1,3,5, then those are every other carbon. So, the structure would be O=C1-C2=O-C3-C4=O-C5-C6=O... No, wait, that can't be. Wait, maybe it's more accurate to say that each of the carbonyl groups is at positions 1,3,5, with the other positions being single bonds. So, the ring would be O=C1-C2-C3-C4-C5-C6-O, but that's impossible because cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. If you have three carbonyl groups at positions 1,3,5, then the structure would be O=C1-C2-C3-C4-C5-C6-O, but with 1,3,5 as carbonyls. Wait, no. Wait, the correct structure would be: Each carbonyl is at C1, C3, and C5. So, the ring would be O=C1-C2-C3-C4-C5-C6-O, but with C1, C3, C5 as carbonyls. Wait, but that's not possible because in a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is connected to the next. So, if C1 is double-bonded to oxygen, then it can't form a single bond to C2 and C6. Wait, actually, no. Carbonyl groups are double bonds to oxygen. So, if C1 is part of a carbonyl group (C=O), then it can still be connected to C2 and C6 via single bonds. So, the structure would be a cyclohexane ring where carbons at positions 1,3,5 are each double-bonded to an oxygen (i.e., ketone groups), and the other carbons (2,4,6) are connected by single bonds. So, each of the C=O groups is separated by two single bonds. In that case, the ring would have three carbonyl groups, each separated by two single bonds. So, the structure would look like this (in a ring): C1(=O)-C2-C3(=O)-C4-C5(=O)-C6, where C6 is connected back to C1. But in such a structure, each of the carbonyl groups is separated by two single bonds. Therefore, the ring would have three carbonyl groups and three single bonds. However, even with that arrangement, there are no CH groups adjacent to the carbonyls. Each carbonyl is attached to a carbon that is part of the ring, and the adjacent carbons (C2, C4, C6) each have two hydrogens. For example, C1 is double-bonded to O, connected to C2 and C6. Since C1 is part of a carbonyl group, it has no hydrogens. Similarly, C3 and C5. The other carbons (C2, C4, C6) each have two hydrogens. For example: C1(=O)-CH2-C3(=O)-CH2-C5(=O)-CH2- So, in that case, the structure is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups and three CH2 groups. In such a structure, the CH2 groups are between the ketone groups. Now, in such a molecule, could a hydrogen from one of the CH2 groups move to the oxygen of a ketone group, forming a different structure? For example, could a hydrogen from a CH2 group adjacent to a ketone group transfer to the oxygen, resulting in a different connectivity? Let's imagine. Suppose we have a ketone group (C=O) connected to a CH2 group. The oxygen has lone pairs, so maybe a hydrogen from CH2 could move to the oxygen, forming a hydroxyl group and converting the ketone to a different group. But how? The mechanism would require a shift of a hydrogen from CH2 to O, forming a hydroxyl group and breaking the double bond. But that would require forming a single bond from C to O and breaking the double bond. That would result in a different structure. For example, if we have: C1(=O)-CH2-C3... moving a hydrogen from CH2 to O would give: C1(-O-H)-C2(-CH3)-... Wait, but that would require rearrangement. If a hydrogen moves from the CH2 group to the oxygen of the ketone, then the ketone (C=O) becomes an alcohol group (C-O-H), and the CH2 group loses a hydrogen to become a CH group. But that would leave a carbon with only single bonds. Wait, but let me try to visualize. Original structure: C1 double-bonded to O, connected to C2 which is CH2. So, C1 is (C=O), connected to C2 (CH2). If a hydrogen from C2 moves to the O of C1, then O gains a hydrogen (becomes -OH), and C2 loses a hydrogen (becomes CH). But C1 would then have to form a single bond to O. But that would mean the original ketone (C=O) becomes a single bond (C-O). But that would require the double bond to break and a single bond to form. However, breaking a double bond (which is energetically unfavorable) and forming a single bond instead would make the molecule less stable. Additionally, such a shift would require a mobile hydrogen, which in this case is just a regular hydrogen on a CH2 group. This seems unlikely to lead to a more stable structure. Alternatively, perhaps the movement of a hydrogen could lead to a different tautomeric form. However, without a conjugated system or some stabilization, this is not feasible. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is unlikely to undergo tautomerism. Similarly, benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone) has two carbonyl groups attached to a benzene ring. The carbonyl groups are at para positions. Each carbonyl is attached to a ring carbon, which is part of the aromatic system. For tautomerism to occur, a hydrogen would need to move from a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group, but in this case, the adjacent carbons are part of the aromatic ring and don't have available hydrogens (since they are involved in the aromatic system). Therefore, benzoquinone also cannot undergo tautomerism. Thus, both compounds don't exhibit tautomerism, but the answer options must specify one of them for part A. Looking back at the original problem statement: "among the following compounds (benzoquinone & cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) the one that does not show tautomerism is..." So the answer should be the one that does not show tautomerism. If both do not show tautomerism, then the answer could be either, but the options given would clarify. The answer choices are: A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate C) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate D) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate So part B is about which compound shows optical isomerism (or optical activity). Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is methyl lactate, which has a chiral center (the second carbon in propanoate) and thus would have optical isomers. Dimethyl fumarate is a diepoxide (if fumarate is a diester of fumaric acid, which is a trans-dicarboxylic acid), but I'm not sure about its structure. However, if dimethyl fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid, then it would be (methoxyethyl) groups attached to the double bonds. But fumarate is a straight chain, so dimethyl fumarate would be likely trans-diepoxide, which may or may not have chiral centers. Alternatively, if fumaric acid is trans-butenedioic acid, then dimethyl fumarate would be the diester (two methyl esters), which would look like this: OMe–CH–CH–CO–OMe, where the double bond is between the two central carbons. Since the double bond is trans (fumarate), the molecule would not have a chiral center. Thus, dimethyl fumarate would not have optical isomers, whereas methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would. Therefore, for part B, the answer should be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (the one with optical isomers). Now, going back to part A. If both compounds (benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) do not show tautomerism, but the answer options must choose one, then perhaps one of them can undergo tautomerism and the other cannot. Maybe I was mistaken earlier. Let me check again. Wait, perhaps benzoquinone can tautomerize. For example, if the benzene ring loses aromaticity, but that's highly unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the two ketone groups in benzoquinone can shift positions via some tautomeric process. However, the positions are fixed by aromaticity. Alternatively, if benzoquinone can exist as a phenol through tautomerism, but that would require breaking the ketone group and forming a hydroxyl group, but that's more of a keto-enol tautomerism, but there's no adjacent CH group. Wait, perhaps benzoquinone can undergo some kind of hydride shift to form a different structure, but that would be a chemical reaction, not tautomerism. Alternatively, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, with three ketone groups, cannot undergo tautomerism, but benzoquinone might be able to undergo some tautomerism if it loses aromaticity. However, breaking aromaticity is very unfavorable, so it's unlikely. Therefore, both likely do not show tautomerism. But if the question assumes that one of them can and the other cannot, then the correct answer would be the one that cannot. Since the answer options for part A are split between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, with options A and D saying cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism, and options B and C saying benzoquinone does not. If I have to choose based on the structures, maybe benzoquinone is less likely to tautomerize because of aromatic stability, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, though strained, could potentially undergo some tautomeric shifts. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, since cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups, it's possible that it can lose a ketone via tautomerism, but I don't see how. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is benzoquinone does not show tautomerism (due to aromatic stability), so the answer is option B or C. But according to the options, if part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (which is correct for optical isomerism), then the correct answer for part B is A or B. But this is confusing. Wait, perhaps I need to check examples of tautomers. For instance, quinones can exist in tautomeric forms called hydroquinones. For example, benzene-1,4-dione (benzoquinone) can tautomerize to resorcinol (1,4-dihydroxybenzene) via a keto-enol tautomerism. Wait, but that's a different type. Let me check: In enol-keto tautomerism, a ketone (or aldehyde) and an enol are tautomers. For an example, acetophenone can exist as an enol and keto form. But in the case of benzoquinone, which is two ketone groups on a benzene ring, could it tautomerize to resorcinol (two hydroxyl groups on a benzene ring)? That would require each ketone converting to a hydroxyl group, which would involve adding two hydrogens (one to the oxygen and one to the carbon). But that's not tautomerism; that's a reduction reaction. Alternatively, perhaps via tautomerism, but that would require moving hydrogens. Wait, let's consider: If benzoquinone (two ketone groups on benzene) can lose aromaticity and undergo keto-enol tautomerism. If the benzene ring becomes non-aromatic, the adjacent positions could allow for enol formation. However, breaking aromaticity is high energy. Suppose the benzoquinone undergoes tautomerism where one of the ketone groups becomes an enol. For example, if one of the carbonyl groups converts to a double bond adjacent to a hydroxyl group. However, this would require a hydrogen to move from a neighboring carbon to the oxygen. However, in benzoquinone, the adjacent carbons are part of the aromatic ring and don't have available hydrogens. Therefore, such tautomerism is not possible. Therefore, benzoquinone does not undergo tautomerism. On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (three ketone groups attached to a cyclohexane ring). If the ring is not aromatic, then perhaps some tautomeric shifts can occur. For example, imagine one of the ketone groups shifting position by moving a hydrogen. However, with three ketone groups spaced around the ring, there's no available hydrogen for such a shift. Each ketone is attached to a carbon which is double-bonded to oxygen, and the adjacent carbons have two hydrogens each. For example, if the structure is: O=C1-C2=C3-O-C4=C5-C6= with appropriate bonding. Wait, actually, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. So each of these carbons is double-bonded to an oxygen, and the other positions are single-bonded. The structure would look like this (in a cycle): O=C1-C2-C3-C4-C5-C6-O=C1-C2-C3... No, perhaps more accurately: 1   3   5 O=C - C - C - C - C - C - O=C ... But in reality, it's a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups. Each carbonyl is separated by a single bond. However, the exact structure is difficult to represent here. Regardless, the point is that each carbonyl group is fixed in its position, and there are no hydrogens adjacent that can move to the oxygen to cause a tautomeric shift. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione also does not undergo tautomerism. Therefore, both compounds do not show tautomerism, but the answer options must specify one. Since the answer options pair A or D (where A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione for part A) with different part B answers, and since part B's correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (which is in options A and B), but part B's correct answer is the one with optical isomerism (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate), then the correct overall answer would be option B or A. However, according to the part B analysis, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has optical isomers, and dimethyl fumarate does not. Therefore, part B answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Now, for part A. If both compounds do not show tautomerism, the answer should be the one where the given compound is the one without tautomerism. But since the answer options pair part A and B answers together. If the answer options are: A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (part A answer), B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (part B answer) B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl... C) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate D) A = cyclo..., B = dimethyl fumarate Since part B requires methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate as the correct answer (for optical isomerism), then the correct option is either A or B. But since part A's correct answer is the compound that does NOT show tautomerism, and if both don't, but according to the options, we have to choose between benzoquinone or cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Alternatively, maybe one of them does show tautomerism. Let me check once more. Benzoquinone: If the benzene ring loses aromaticity, perhaps it can tautomerize. But breaking aromaticity requires significant energy, so it's not a typical tautomerism. On the other hand, if benzoquinone can exist in equilibrium with resorcinol (1,4-dihydroxybenzene), that would be tautomerism. But in reality, benzoquinone and resorcinol are not tautomers; they are separate compounds. To convert benzoquinone to resorcinol requires a chemical reaction (like reduction with acid), not tautomerism. Therefore, benzoquinone does not tautomerize. Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: This compound is highly strained due to the three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. However, the rigidity of the structure likely prevents any tautomeric shifts. Therefore, it also does not show tautomerism. Hence, both compounds do not show tautomerism. However, maybe the question refers to the possibility of the compounds existing in different tautomeric forms. For example, if cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can have different arrangements of the ketone groups, but with symmetry, all are equivalent. Alternatively, maybe the answer expected is that benzoquinone does not show tautomerism because it's aromatic and stabilized, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, though not aromatic, might have some tautomeric potential. But I cannot find any evidence for that. Given that, and given the answer options, perhaps the intended answer is benzoquinone (option B or C), but given my analysis, both don't show tautomerism. However, since the part B correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (options A and B), then if the correct overall answer is option B: A = benzoquinone (for part A), and B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (for part B). But why would benzoquinone be the correct answer for part A (the one that does not show tautomerism) if both don't? Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the problem statement, and the actual compounds are different. Alternatively, maybe there's an error in my reasoning. Alternatively, considering that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a conjugated system, but without any hydrogen on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups, tautomerism is not possible. Benzoquinone's structure is more rigid due to aromaticity, so also no tautomerism. Therefore, the correct answer for part A is either, but given the options, if the book answer says otherwise... But since this is my analysis, and if forced to choose based on the given options and standard reasoning, I would have to guess that the intended answer is benzoquinone does not show tautomerism (due to aromatic stability), so option B or C. But wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is B) for option B. Wait, this is very time-consuming. Let me recapitulate. Part A: Which of the two (benzoquinone or cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) does NOT show tautomerism? Answer: Both do not, but if forced to choose, benzoquinone (due to aromatic stability) is less likely to tautomerize, so the answer is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism? But I don't think so. Alternatively, the answer is benzoquinone does not show tautomerism. Part B: Which compound shows optical isomerism? Answer: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Therefore, the correct answer is option B: A = benzoquinone (does not show tautomerism), B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (shows optical isomerism). Therefore, the answer is \boxed{B}
</Think>

Answer: To determine which compound does not show tautomerism and which shows optical isomerism, we analyze the structures and properties of the given compounds.

### Part A: Tautomerism
**Benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone)**:
- Consists of two carbonyl groups attached to a benzene ring.
- The aromatic ring stability makes it highly unlikely for benzoquinone to undergo tautomerism, as breaking aromaticity is energetically unfavorable.
- No adjacent CH groups to the carbonyl allow for keto-enol tautomerism.

**Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**:
- Contains three ketone groups attached to a cyclohexane ring.
- The rigid structure and lack of available hydrogen atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups prevent any tautomeric shifts.
- The high strain and symmetry of the molecule also inhibit tautomeric forms.

Both compounds are unlikely to show tautomerism. However, given the answer options, **benzoquinone** is considered the correct answer for not showing tautomerism due to its aromatic stability.

### Part B: Optical Isomerism
**Methyl

1: tautomerism involves the reversible interconversion of chemical structures that have the same molecular formula but differ in the connectivity or arrangement of atoms. this phenomenon is exemplified by the keto-enol tautomerism observed in compounds such as acetylacetone. a tautomeric pair includes a keto form, characterized by a carbonyl group, and an enol form, featuring a double bond and a hydroxyl group. the presence of conjugation and the ability to form a six-membered ring transition state facilitate this interconversion.

so maybe neither shows tautomerism? wait, but the question is to choose between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione for which one does not show tautomerism. if neither shows it, then... hmm. wait, maybe i made a mistake here.
let me check again. benzoquinone: two ketone groups on benzene ring. for tautomerism like keto-enol, you need a ketone adjacent to a ch group, right? but in benzoquinone, the ketones are attached directly to the ring. so each carbonyl is attached to a ring carbon. the adjacent groups would be other parts of the ring, which are all bonded in a hexagonal structure. so, there's no ch group adjacent to the carbonyl; adjacent atoms are part of the ring. therefore, benzoquinone can't undergo keto-enol tautomerism. similarly, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. each carbonyl is attached to a ring carbon, and the adjacent groups are other ring carbons. so again, no ch groups adjacent to the carbonyls, hence no keto-enol tautomerism. wait, so then both don't show tautomerism? then why in part a, we have to choose which one does not show tautomerism. if both don't, then the answer would be either a or d. wait, maybe i'm missing another type of tautomerism. are there other types besides keto-enol? yes. for example, amide-imidic acid tautomerism, but these compounds are not amides. let's see. another possibility is hydrogen shifting between different positions. but in benzoquinone, the structure is two carbonyl groups attached to the benzene ring. for tautomerism, you would need a hydrogen to shift from one position to another, converting a double bond or a carbonyl. but since benzoquinone is just a quinone (benzene ring with two ketone groups), without any adjacent ch groups, i don't see how tautomerism can occur. similarly, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a triketone. each carbonyl is attached to a different carbon of the cyclohexane ring. since all adjacent carbons are part of the ring and don't have ch groups, there's no possibility for hydrogen shift. wait, unless there is some kind of [ch...o] tautomerism? for example, if one of the carbonyl groups could shift by moving a hydrogen from a bridgehead or something. wait, but the cyclohexane ring is a six-membered ring. if there are three ketone groups, each attached to a carbon, spaced every two positions (1,3,5). then each ketone is separated by two other carbons. so, the adjacent carbons to each ketone are part of the ring, but maybe not part of a ch group. wait, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the structure would have carbons 1, 3, and 5 as carbonyls. then carbons 2,4,6 would be part of the ring. wait, but each carbonyl is attached to oxygen, so the carbons are double-bonded to oxygen. then each of those carbons is connected to the oxygen, and the remaining bonds are to the neighboring ring carbons. therefore, there are no ch groups on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyls. therefore, no possibility for hydrogen to move. hence, no tautomerism here. so, in that case, both compounds don't show tautomerism? then the answer a would be cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione and b would be... wait, but the answer options need to be selected. let's look at the options. for part a, the compound that does not show tautomerism. if both don't show tautomerism, then either a or d is correct. but according to the answer options, let's check. option a says a = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, b = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. option b says a = benzoquinone, b = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. option c says a = benzoquinone, b = dimethyl fumarate. option d says a = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, b = dimethyl fumarate. so if part a is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, then answer choices a and d are possible. if part a is benzoquinone, then b and c are possible. but if both compounds don't exhibit tautomerism, which is the correct answer? hmm. maybe i made a mistake here. let me re-express benzoquinone's structure. benzoquinone is para- or ortho- or meta-diquinone. wait, actually, benzoquinone is 1,4-benzoquinone. so the structure is a benzene ring with carbonyl groups at positions 1 and 4. so, the carbonyls are para to each other. in that case, each carbonyl is attached to a ring carbon, and the adjacent carbons (e.g., positions 2,3,5,6) are part of the ring but not ch groups. wait, but maybe in conjugated systems there can be some tautomerism. wait, quinones can undergo some tautomeric shifts? for example, in some cases, quinones can exist in resonance with phenolic forms, but that's resonance, not tautomerism. tautomerism requires the actual movement of a hydrogen atom and a change in bonding. alternatively, perhaps in benzoquinone, one of the carbonyl groups could shift by moving a hydrogen, but given that the carbonyls are part of the aromatic ring, i don't see how that's possible without breaking the aromaticity. wait, maybe the tautomerism isn't that of the carbonyl group but some other group. wait, perhaps enolization elsewhere. wait, but there's no adjacent ch group. alternatively, maybe the benzene ring could become non-aromatic and allow for tautomerism. but that would require breaking the conjugation, which is not favorable. alternatively, perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, despite being a triketone, can't undergo tautomerism because all the carbonyl groups are fixed. alternatively, maybe one of them can undergo some kind of tautomeric shift. for instance, if one of the carbonyl groups is part of a five-membered ring or something, but since it's a six-membered cyclohexane ring, with three carbonyls, perhaps it's possible? wait, if the cyclohexane ring is in a chair conformation, perhaps some of the carbonyl groups are axial or equatorial. however, tautomerism relates to the connectivity, not just the conformation. alternatively, maybe the cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo some kind of sigmatropic shift, like a wagner-meerwein rearrangement, but that's a rearrangement, not tautomerism. hmm. wait, perhaps i should think of another example. for instance, ortho-nitrophenoxide can undergo keto-enol-like tautomerism? wait, but without a ch group, i don't see how. alternatively, maybe the cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can lose a hydrogen from one of the bridgehead carbons to form a double bond. wait, but in a cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups, the remaining carbons would each have two hydrogens. for example, if the ring is 1,3,5-trione, then the structure is o=c1-c2-c3-o-c4-c5-c6-o..., but no, the actual structure is each of the 1,3,5 positions is a carbonyl. therefore, the ring would have o=c-c-o-c-c-o=c-c-o-c-c=o... no, actually, the cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have the structure where each of the 1,3,5 positions is a carbonyl group. so, in other words, the ring would be o=c6-h2-c1-h2-o-c2-h2-c3-h2-o-c4-h2-c5-h2- but with the 1,3,5 positions as carbonyls. wait, no. if it's cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, then the carbonyl groups are at positions 1,3,5. so, each of those carbons is part of a carbonyl group (double-bonded to oxygen), and the other positions are single bonds. so, the ring would look like: o=c1-c2-c3-c4-c5-c6-o where the numbering is 1,2,3,4,5,6. but no, that's not possible. wait, actually, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have three carbonyl groups attached to the cyclohexane ring at positions 1,3,5. wait, but cyclohexane has six carbons. if you put a carbonyl group at 1,3,5, then those are every other carbon. so, the structure would be o=c1-c2=o-c3-c4=o-c5-c6=o... no, wait, that can't be. wait, maybe it's more accurate to say that each of the carbonyl groups is at positions 1,3,5, with the other positions being single bonds. so, the ring would be o=c1-c2-c3-c4-c5-c6-o, but that's impossible because cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. if you have three carbonyl groups at positions 1,3,5, then the structure would be o=c1-c2-c3-c4-c5-c6-o, but with 1,3,5 as carbonyls. wait, no. wait, the correct structure would be: each carbonyl is at c1, c3, and c5. so, the ring would be o=c1-c2-c3-c4-c5-c6-o, but with c1, c3, c5 as carbonyls. wait, but that's not possible because in a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is connected to the next. so, if c1 is double-bonded to oxygen, then it can't form a single bond to c2 and c6. wait, actually, no. carbonyl groups are double bonds to oxygen. so, if c1 is part of a carbonyl group (c=o), then it can still be connected to c2 and c6 via single bonds. so, the structure would be a cyclohexane ring where carbons at positions 1,3,5 are each double-bonded to an oxygen (i.e., ketone groups), and the other carbons (2,4,6) are connected by single bonds. so, each of the c=o groups is separated by two single bonds. in that case, the ring would have three carbonyl groups, each separated by two single bonds. so, the structure would look like this (in a ring): c1(=o)-c2-c3(=o)-c4-c5(=o)-c6, where c6 is connected back to c1. but in such a structure, each of the carbonyl groups is separated by two single bonds. therefore, the ring would have three carbonyl groups and three single bonds. however, even with that arrangement, there are no ch groups adjacent to the carbonyls. each carbonyl is attached to a carbon that is part of the ring, and the adjacent carbons (c2, c4, c6) each have two hydrogens. for example, c1 is double-bonded to o, connected to c2 and c6. since c1 is part of a carbonyl group, it has no hydrogens. similarly, c3 and c5. the other carbons (c2, c4, c6) each have two hydrogens. for example: c1(=o)-ch2-c3(=o)-ch2-c5(=o)-ch2- so, in that case, the structure is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups and three ch2 groups. in such a structure, the ch2 groups are between the ketone groups. now, in such a molecule, could a hydrogen from one of the ch2 groups move to the oxygen of a ketone group, forming a different structure? for example, could a hydrogen from a ch2 group adjacent to a ketone group transfer to the oxygen, resulting in a different connectivity? let's imagine. suppose we have a ketone group (c=o) connected to a ch2 group. the oxygen has lone pairs, so maybe a hydrogen from ch2 could move to the oxygen, forming a hydroxyl group and converting the ketone to a different group. but how? the mechanism would require a shift of a hydrogen from ch2 to o, forming a hydroxyl group and breaking the double bond. but that would require forming a single bond from c to o and breaking the double bond. that would result in a different structure. for example, if we have: c1(=o)-ch2-c3... moving a hydrogen from ch2 to o would give: c1(-o-h)-c2(-ch3)-... wait, but that would require rearrangement. if a hydrogen moves from the ch2 group to the oxygen of the ketone, then the ketone (c=o) becomes an alcohol group (c-o-h), and the ch2 group loses a hydrogen to become a ch group. but that would leave a carbon with only single bonds. wait, but let me try to visualize. original structure: c1 double-bonded to o, connected to c2 which is ch2. so, c1 is (c=o), connected to c2 (ch2). if a hydrogen from c2 moves to the o of c1, then o gains a hydrogen (becomes -oh), and c2 loses a hydrogen (becomes ch). but c1 would then have to form a single bond to o. but that would mean the original ketone (c=o) becomes a single bond (c-o). but that would require the double bond to break and a single bond to form. however, breaking a double bond (which is energetically unfavorable) and forming a single bond instead would make the molecule less stable. additionally, such a shift would require a mobile hydrogen, which in this case is just a regular hydrogen on a ch2 group. this seems unlikely to lead to a more stable structure. alternatively, perhaps the movement of a hydrogen could lead to a different tautomeric form. however, without a conjugated system or some stabilization, this is not feasible. therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is unlikely to undergo tautomerism. similarly, benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone) has two carbonyl groups attached to a benzene ring. the carbonyl groups are at para positions. each carbonyl is attached to a ring carbon, which is part of the aromatic system. for tautomerism to occur, a hydrogen would need to move from a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group, but in this case, the adjacent carbons are part of the aromatic ring and don't have available hydrogens (since they are involved in the aromatic system). therefore, benzoquinone also cannot undergo tautomerism. thus, both compounds don't exhibit tautomerism, but the answer options must specify one of them for part a. looking back at the original problem statement: "among the following compounds (benzoquinone & cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) the one that does not show tautomerism is..." so the answer should be the one that does not show tautomerism. if both do not show tautomerism, then the answer could be either, but the options given would clarify. the answer choices are: a) a = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, b = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate b) a = benzoquinone, b = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate c) a = benzoquinone, b = dimethyl fumarate d) a = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, b = dimethyl fumarate so part b is about which compound shows optical isomerism (or optical activity). methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is methyl lactate, which has a chiral center (the second carbon in propanoate) and thus would have optical isomers. dimethyl fumarate is a diepoxide (if fumarate is a diester of fumaric acid, which is a trans-dicarboxylic acid), but i'm not sure about its structure. however, if dimethyl fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid, then it would be (methoxyethyl) groups attached to the double bonds. but fumarate is a straight chain, so dimethyl fumarate would be likely trans-diepoxide, which may or may not have chiral centers. alternatively, if fumaric acid is trans-butenedioic acid, then dimethyl fumarate would be the diester (two methyl esters), which would look like this: ome–ch–ch–co–ome, where the double bond is between the two central carbons. since the double bond is trans (fumarate), the molecule would not have a chiral center. thus, dimethyl fumarate would not have optical isomers, whereas methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would. therefore, for part b, the answer should be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (the one with optical isomers). now, going back to part a. if both compounds (benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) do not show tautomerism, but the answer options must choose one, then perhaps one of them can undergo tautomerism and the other cannot. maybe i was mistaken earlier. let me check again. wait, perhaps benzoquinone can tautomerize. for example, if the benzene ring loses aromaticity, but that's highly unlikely. alternatively, maybe the two ketone groups in benzoquinone can shift positions via some tautomeric process. however, the positions are fixed by aromaticity. alternatively, if benzoquinone can exist as a phenol through tautomerism, but that would require breaking the ketone group and forming a hydroxyl group, but that's more of a keto-enol tautomerism, but there's no adjacent ch group. wait, perhaps benzoquinone can undergo some kind of hydride shift to form a different structure, but that would be a chemical reaction, not tautomerism. alternatively, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, with three ketone groups, cannot undergo tautomerism, but benzoquinone might be able to undergo some tautomerism if it loses aromaticity. however, breaking aromaticity is very unfavorable, so it's unlikely. therefore, both likely do not show tautomerism. but if the question assumes that one of them can and the other cannot, then the correct answer would be the one that cannot. since the answer options for part a are split between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, with options a and d saying cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism, and options b and c saying benzoquinone does not. if i have to choose based on the structures, maybe benzoquinone is less likely to tautomerize because of aromatic stability, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, though strained, could potentially undergo some tautomeric shifts. but i'm not sure. alternatively, since cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups, it's possible that it can lose a ketone via tautomerism, but i don't see how. alternatively, maybe the correct answer is benzoquinone does not show tautomerism (due to aromatic stability), so the answer is option b or c. but according to the options, if part b is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (which is correct for optical isomerism), then the correct answer for part b is a or b. but this is confusing. wait, perhaps i need to check examples of tautomers. for instance, quinones can exist in tautomeric forms called hydroquinones. for example, benzene-1,4-dione (benzoquinone) can tautomerize to resorcinol (1,4-dihydroxybenzene) via a keto-enol tautomerism. wait, but that's a different type. let me check: in enol-keto tautomerism, a ketone (or aldehyde) and an enol are tautomers. for an example, acetophenone can exist as an enol and keto form. but in the case of benzoquinone, which is two ketone groups on a benzene ring, could it tautomerize to resorcinol (two hydroxyl groups on a benzene ring)? that would require each ketone converting to a hydroxyl group, which would involve adding two hydrogens (one to the oxygen and one to the carbon). but that's not tautomerism; that's a reduction reaction. alternatively, perhaps via tautomerism, but that would require moving hydrogens. wait, let's consider: if benzoquinone (two ketone groups on benzene) can lose aromaticity and undergo keto-enol tautomerism. if the benzene ring becomes non-aromatic, the adjacent positions could allow for enol formation. however, breaking aromaticity is high energy. suppose the benzoquinone undergoes tautomerism where one of the ketone groups becomes an enol. for example, if one of the carbonyl groups converts to a double bond adjacent to a hydroxyl group. however, this would require a hydrogen to move from a neighboring carbon to the oxygen. however, in benzoquinone, the adjacent carbons are part of the aromatic ring and don't have available hydrogens. therefore, such tautomerism is not possible. therefore, benzoquinone does not undergo tautomerism. on the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (three ketone groups attached to a cyclohexane ring). if the ring is not aromatic, then perhaps some tautomeric shifts can occur. for example, imagine one of the ketone groups shifting position by moving a hydrogen. however, with three ketone groups spaced around the ring, there's no available hydrogen for such a shift. each ketone is attached to a carbon which is double-bonded to oxygen, and the adjacent carbons have two hydrogens each. for example, if the structure is: o=c1-c2=c3-o-c4=c5-c6= with appropriate bonding. wait, actually, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. so each of these carbons is double-bonded to an oxygen, and the other positions are single-bonded. the structure would look like this (in a cycle): o=c1-c2-c3-c4-c5-c6-o=c1-c2-c3... no, perhaps more accurately: 1   3   5 o=c - c - c - c - c - c - o=c ... but in reality, it's a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups. each carbonyl is separated by a single bond. however, the exact structure is difficult to represent here. regardless, the point is that each carbonyl group is fixed in its position, and there are no hydrogens adjacent that can move to the oxygen to cause a tautomeric shift. therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione also does not undergo tautomerism. therefore, both compounds do not show tautomerism, but the answer options must specify one. since the answer options pair a or d (where a is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione for part a) with different part b answers, and since part b's correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (which is in options a and b), but part b's correct answer is the one with optical isomerism (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate), then the correct overall answer would be option b or a. however, according to the part b analysis, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has optical isomers, and dimethyl fumarate does not. therefore, part b answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. now, for part a. if both compounds do not show tautomerism, the answer should be the one where the given compound is the one without tautomerism. but since the answer options pair part a and b answers together. if the answer options are: a) a = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (part a answer), b = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (part b answer) b) a = benzoquinone, b = methyl... c) a = benzoquinone, b = dimethyl fumarate d) a = cyclo..., b = dimethyl fumarate since part b requires methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate as the correct answer (for optical isomerism), then the correct option is either a or b. but since part a's correct answer is the compound that does not show tautomerism, and if both don't, but according to the options, we have to choose between benzoquinone or cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. alternatively, maybe one of them does show tautomerism. let me check once more. benzoquinone: if the benzene ring loses aromaticity, perhaps it can tautomerize. but breaking aromaticity requires significant energy, so it's not a typical tautomerism. on the other hand, if benzoquinone can exist in equilibrium with resorcinol (1,4-dihydroxybenzene), that would be tautomerism. but in reality, benzoquinone and resorcinol are not tautomers; they are separate compounds. to convert benzoquinone to resorcinol requires a chemical reaction (like reduction with acid), not tautomerism. therefore, benzoquinone does not tautomerize. cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: this compound is highly strained due to the three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. however, the rigidity of the structure likely prevents any tautomeric shifts. therefore, it also does not show tautomerism. hence, both compounds do not show tautomerism. however, maybe the question refers to the possibility of the compounds existing in different tautomeric forms. for example, if cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can have different arrangements of the ketone groups, but with symmetry, all are equivalent. alternatively, maybe the answer expected is that benzoquinone does not show tautomerism because it's aromatic and stabilized, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, though not aromatic, might have some tautomeric potential. but i cannot find any evidence for that. given that, and given the answer options, perhaps the intended answer is benzoquinone (option b or c), but given my analysis, both don't show tautomerism. however, since the part b correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (options a and b), then if the correct overall answer is option b: a = benzoquinone (for part a), and b = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (for part b). but why would benzoquinone be the correct answer for part a (the one that does not show tautomerism) if both don't? alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the problem statement, and the actual compounds are different. alternatively, maybe there's an error in my reasoning. alternatively, considering that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a conjugated system, but without any hydrogen on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups, tautomerism is not possible. benzoquinone's structure is more rigid due to aromaticity, so also no tautomerism. therefore, the correct answer for part a is either, but given the options, if the book answer says otherwise... but since this is my analysis, and if forced to choose based on the given options and standard reasoning, i would have to guess that the intended answer is benzoquinone does not show tautomerism (due to aromatic stability), so option b or c. but wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is b) for option b. wait, this is very time-consuming. let me recapitulate. part a: which of the two (benzoquinone or cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) does not show tautomerism? answer: both do not, but if forced to choose, benzoquinone (due to aromatic stability) is less likely to tautomerize, so the answer is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione shows tautomerism? but i don't think so. alternatively, the answer is benzoquinone does not show tautomerism. part b: which compound shows optical isomerism? answer: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. therefore, the correct answer is option b: a = benzoquinone (does not show tautomerism), b = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (shows optical isomerism). therefore, the answer is \boxed{b}

answer: to determine which compound does not show tautomerism and which shows optical isomerism, we analyze the structures and properties of the given compounds.

### part a: tautomerism
**benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone)**:
- consists of two carbonyl groups attached to a benzene ring.
- the aromatic ring stability makes it highly unlikely for benzoquinone to undergo tautomerism, as breaking aromaticity is energetically unfavorable.
- no adjacent ch groups to the carbonyl allow for keto-enol tautomerism.

**cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**:
- contains three ketone groups attached to a cyclohexane ring.
- the rigid structure and lack of available hydrogen atoms adjacent to the carbonyl groups prevent any tautomeric shifts.
- the high strain and symmetry of the molecule also inhibit tautomeric forms.

both compounds are unlikely to show tautomerism. however, given the answer options, **benzoquinone** is considered the correct answer for not showing tautomerism due to its aromatic stability.

### part b: optical isomerism
**methyl
