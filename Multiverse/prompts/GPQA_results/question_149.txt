Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. It's about analyzing a peptidic compound using NMR and LC-MS. The question is asking for the most likely explanation of observing two peaks in the LC-MS spectrum, both with the same mass but different retention times, and also two peaks in the NMR corresponding to the same alpha-proton.
First, let me break down the information given: 1. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. These peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals (totaling 1H). The coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. So, why are there two peaks for one proton? Normally, a single proton would give one peak, unless there's some kind of splitting due to coupling, but the question states that spin-spin coupling is not the explanation. So, maybe the proton is in two different environments? That could happen if there are two diastereomers or different conformers. Wait, but enantiomers wouldn't split a proton's peak because they are mirror images and would have the same chemical shift in a racemic mixture unless using a chiral solvent or some resolving agent. But if it's diastereoisomers, then their chemical shifts can differ because they are non-superimposable and might have different environments. But the problem mentions that the integrals together sum to 1H, which is expected. So, if there are two diastereomers, each contributing half of the integral. But wait, diastereomers would have different chemical shifts for the protons, so each diastereomer would have their own peaks. But in the NMR, they observed two peaks for the same alpha-proton. Hmm. So maybe the compound exists as a mixture where there are two different diastereoisomers, each giving a different chemical shift for that alpha-proton. Since they are diastereomers, their physical properties differ, so they would elute at different times in the LC-MS, giving two peaks. But the problem says both peaks in LC-MS have the same mass spectrum, consistent with the expected molecule. So, they must be different forms of the same molecule. If they were enantiomers, their mass spectra would be the same because mass spectrometry doesn't distinguish between enantiomers; they have the same molecular formula and structure in terms of connectivity, just different spatial arrangement. So, LC-MS at elevated temperature shows two peaks of equal intensity. Elevated temperature in LC-MS might affect the separation, but if they elute at different times, perhaps due to different conformations or diastereomers. Wait, but enantiomers would have the same chromatographic behavior in a non-chiral column, so unless it's a chiral column. The problem doesn't mention a chiral column, so maybe it's a chiral column, but then why would enantiomers elute at different times? Hmm, maybe the mobile phase or temperature affects the separation. However, if it's a chiral column, enantiomers would elute at different times. But the problem states that LC-MS shows two peaks of equal intensity, same mass spectrum. So, same molecule but different forms. If it's enantiomers, they would have the same mass spectrum. But if it's diastereoisomers, their mass spectra would be the same only if their molecular formula and structure (connectivity) are the same. Wait, but diastereoisomers have different spatial arrangements that can lead to different physical properties but same connectivity. However, in mass spectrometry, which looks at molecular weight and fragmentation, unless the diastereomers have different cleavages, the mass spectrum might look the same. But the problem states that both peaks have the same mass spectrum, consistent with the expected molecule. So, the mass spectrum is the same, which would be true for enantiomers, but might also be true for diastereomers if their fragmentation patterns are the same. But diastereomers usually have different chemical shifts (as observed in NMR) and different physical properties (like melting points, solubility), so they might elute at different times in chromatography. So, option C says the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers. That would explain the two peaks in LC-MS (different retention times due to different properties) and the same mass spectrum. But in the NMR, since diastereoisomers have different chemical environments, the same alpha-proton in each diastereomer would have different chemical shifts, leading to two peaks in the NMR. However, if the sample is a 1:1 mixture, the integrals would be roughly equal, which matches the observation. But wait, if the compound is a mixture of diastereoisomers, then in solution, the two diastereomers would be in equilibrium, interconverting, but if the interconversion is slow on the NMR timescale, you would observe two distinct peaks. However, if it's a separable mixture, like when isolated, then in the NMR you would see a mixture. Wait, but the problem says in the crude compound, so maybe during synthesis, a diastereomeric excess wasn't achieved, resulting in a mixture. But the NMR is of the crude compound. Alternatively, maybe the compound has a dynamic process, such as epimerization, but if the process is fast, then maybe a single peak. But if it's at elevated temperature, maybe the interconversion is slower, leading to two peaks in NMR. Hmm. Alternatively, think about the LC-MS: two peaks of equal intensity, same mass spectrum. So, same molecular weight and fragmentation, but different retention times. If using a chiral column in LC, enantiomers would elute at different times, but give same MS. But if it's a non-chiral column, enantiomers would elute together, so maybe the column is chiral here. Then option B would be a possibility. But in that case, how would the NMR show two peaks for the same proton? Enantiomers in a racemic mixture (50:50) would have the same chemical shift only if the NMR is run in a chiral solvent. Otherwise, they would have the same shift in a achiral solvent. Wait, no, enantiomers in an achiral environment (like CDCl3) would have the same chemical shifts. Unless there's a chiral center nearby that affects the proton's environment. Wait, but if the enantiomers have a chiral center, but the alpha-proton is symmetric. Wait, maybe the molecule has a chiral center, leading to enantiomers. Each enantiomer would have different chemical shifts for protons that are not symmetric. Wait, but the problem states that the two peaks correspond to the same alpha-proton. So, if the molecule has enantiomers, the alpha-protons in each enantiomer would have the same chemical shift in a racemic mixture, unless the NMR is run in a chiral solvent. But usually, solvents like CDCl3 are achiral, so enantiomers would not split a proton's peak. Therefore, if the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton, it's more likely due to diastereoisomers. Because diastereomers can have different chemical shifts. So, if you have a mixture of diastereoisomers, each diastereomer would cause the same proton to have a different chemical shift, leading to two peaks in the NMR. Also, in LC-MS, they would elute at different times because diastereomers have different interactions with the column stationary phase. But wait, the problem says the LC-MS is at elevated temperature. Maybe the elevated temperature affects the resolution, but if there are two distinct compounds (diastereomers), they would still elute separately. So, that could fit with option C.

1: Option B proposes that the crude compound is a mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers typically exhibit identical NMR chemical shifts in an achiral solvent, as they are mirror images of each other. If the NMR solvent used were achiral, the same alpha-proton in enantiomers would have the same chemical shift, and only a single peak would be observed, contradicting the described observation of two distinct peaks. A single peak would also be expected if the enantiomers interconvert rapidly under the experimental conditions. The problem states that the two peaks in the NMR correspond to the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts and integrals totaling 1H, and that spin-spin coupling is not the cause. This observation of two peaks for a single proton suggests distinct chemical environments. Enantiomers do not typically cause such distinct chemical environments in an achiral solvent, making option B an unlikely explanation for the NMR data.

2: Option B proposes the presence of enantiomers. Enantiomers possess identical mass spectra and, if analyzed using a chiral column in LC-MS, would elute at different times.

1: Option C suggests the presence of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have distinct chemical shifts due to their different spatial arrangements, even if their connectivity is the same. Consequently, the same alpha-proton in different diastereoisomers would exhibit different chemical shifts, leading to the observation of two separate peaks in the NMR spectrum. The problem states that the integrals of these two peaks sum to 1H, which is consistent with a 1:1 mixture of diastereoisomers. A 1:1 ratio is a common outcome when diastereomers form from a racemic mixture during the reaction process.

2: The LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature revealed two distinct peaks of equal intensity, with identical mass spectra matching the expected compound. Diastereoisomers, being distinct compounds with different physical properties, would elute at different times during LC-MS, resulting in separate peaks. Their identical molecular formula and connectivity ensure that their mass spectra are the same. The observation of two peaks with identical mass spectra is consistent with diastereoisomers. A 1:1 mixture of diastereoisomers would produce peaks of equal intensity in LC-MS, aligning with the experimental finding.

The formation of diastereoisomers (option C) provides a consistent explanation for both the NMR observation of two distinct peaks for a single proton and the LC-MS finding of two peaks with identical mass spectra and equal intensity.

Another thought: If the problem was about atropisomers (diasteroisomers due to restricted rotation), but the question mentions alpha-protons. Maybe the alpha-carbon is chiral, leading to diastereoisomers. Then each diastereomer would have different chemical shifts for the alpha-protons. So, yes, that could make sense. Alternatively, option D: 'Double coupling' during amide-bond formation. Hmmm. If during the amide bond formation, there's some kind of coupling that leads to two different products. But the problem says that spin-spin coupling is already ruled out. So maybe this is not the answer. The problem states that the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling as an explanation. So, answer D is suggesting 'double coupling' which might be some other type of coupling, but I'm not familiar with that term in this context. Maybe it's not the right answer. Option A: contamination with a precursor. If there was a precursor present, then the LC-MS might show a peak for the product and a peak for the precursor. However, the problem states that the NMR is consistent with the expected molecule, except for the two peaks. So, if it's a precursor, the NMR might show signals from the precursor, but the problem says the spectrum is consistent with the expected molecule. So, contamination with precursor is less likely. Therefore, between options C and B. But considering that enantiomers would have the same chemical shifts in an achiral environment, leading to a single peak in NMR, whereas diastereomers would give different chemical shifts, leading to two peaks. So, the fact that there are two peaks in NMR for the same proton suggests diastereomers. Also, the LC-MS shows two peaks with the same mass, which diastereomers would have (since they have the same molecular formula). But wait, same mass spectrum - diastereomers would have the same mass spectrum because they are constitutional isomers with the same molecular formula. Wait, no, diastereomers have the same connectivity but different stereochemistry. So, their fragmentation in MS would be the same unless the stereochemistry affects some cleavage pathways. But maybe in this case, the MS is the same. So, if the two LC peaks correspond to diastereomers, they would have the same mass spectrum but different retention times. Therefore, option C is the best answer. Alternatively, if it's enantiomers, they would have the same chemical shift in NMR (unless using a chiral solvent or chiral column). But the problem doesn't mention a chiral solvent. So, unless the solvent is chiral, enantiomers wouldn't split the peak. Therefore, the most plausible explanation is that there are diastereoisomers present. So the answer should be C.

Answer: The problem involves analyzing a peptidic compound using 1H NMR and LC-MS. The key observations are two peaks in the NMR corresponding to the same alpha-proton (ruling out spin-spin coupling) and two peaks in LC-MS with equal intensities and identical mass spectra. 

Option C (a mixture of diastereoisomers) is the most likely explanation because:
1. **NMR Observations**: Diastereoisomers have different chemical environments, leading to distinct peaks for the same alpha-proton. This explains the two peaks in the NMR with similar chemical shifts and integrated intensities summing to 1H.
2. **LC-MS Observations**: Diastereoisomers elute at different retention times due to varying physical properties, explaining the two peaks in LC-MS. Despite structural differences, they share the same molecular formula, resulting in identical mass spectra.

Other options are less suitable:
- **Option A (contamination)** contradicts the NMR consistency with the expected molecule.
- **Option B (enantiomers)** would not cause peak splitting in NMR under achiral conditions and would elute together in non-chiral LC.
- **Option D ('double coupling')** is inconsistent with the ruled-out spin-spin coupling.

Thus, the final answer is \boxed{C}.
