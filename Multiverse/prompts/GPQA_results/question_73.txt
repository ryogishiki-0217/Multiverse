Okay, so I need to solve this multiple-choice physics problem about astronauts traveling at relativistic speeds and figure out the correct relative speed and total energy of the system. Let me start by carefully reading the problem again.
The question is: Two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They are traveling in the positive x-direction at relativistic speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively. We need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.
The options are A to D, with different combinations of relative speed (v_rel) and total energy (E).
First, I need to recall the concepts of relative velocity in special relativity and total energy of a system.
Let's think in parallel.

</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Each particle's relativistic energy E is given by E = gamma * mc^2, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).
First, let's compute the relative speed.
Since both astronauts are moving in the same direction (positive x-direction), but with different speeds, the relative speed between them is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula.
Wait, actually, if they are moving in the same direction, the formula would be for their relative velocity.
Let me recall: If two objects are moving with velocities v1 and v2 in the same reference frame (say, the Earth's frame), then their relative velocity in classical mechanics is v1 - v2. However, at relativistic speeds, the relative velocity is given by the formula v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1v2/c2)).
Wait, but actually, the formula for combining velocities in relativity is when you have an object moving at velocity u in a frame S' which is moving at velocity v relative to S. Then the velocity u' in S is (u + v)/(1 + uv/c2). But in this case, the two astronauts are moving in the same frame (presumably the Earth's frame) with velocities 0.6c and 0.5c. If we need their relative speed in their own rest frames? Wait, that might not be the case.
Wait, confusion arises here. Let's clarify: The problem asks for the "relative speed" between the two astronauts. So, if they are both moving in the same direction (positive x-direction) with speeds 0.6c and 0.5c in some reference frame (probably the Earth's), then their relative speed in that frame is simply 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. But that can't be right because in relativity, velocities don't subtract like that when they are in the same direction. Wait, actually, no. Wait, if two objects are moving in the same direction, their relative velocity is calculated using the formula:
If object A is moving at v1 in the positive x-direction, and object B is moving at v2 in the same direction, then from Earth's frame, the velocity of A relative to B (or B relative to A) is given by (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1v2/c2)). Wait, but actually, that formula is when one velocity is added to another in different frames. Maybe I need to use the velocity subtraction formula. Hmmm. Let's think carefully.
Suppose we have two astronauts, A and B. In the Earth's reference frame, S, astronaut A is moving at velocity v1 = 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at velocity v2 = 0.5c. The relative speed between them, let's say from A's perspective or B's perspective, would depend on which frame we transform to. But the problem doesn't specify from which frame they are observing each other. Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. It says "the relative speed and the total energy of the system."
Wait, maybe "the system" refers to both astronauts together. Hmm. But the question is a bit unclear. Let me parse the question again: "What will be the relative speed and the total energy of the system?" So, the system is the two astronauts. Therefore, the total energy of the system would be the sum of their rest energies plus their kinetic energies in the given reference frame. But relative speed between them—do we need it in their own rest frames or in the lab frame? The problem says "relative speed," which is typically the speed of one object as seen in the rest frame of the other. But since both are moving in the same direction, to find the relative speed, you have to transform into one astronaut's frame and see the speed of the other.

1: The relative velocity of the 3m astronaut, moving at 0.5c in the lab frame, as observed from the rest frame of the 2m astronaut, moving at 0.6c in the lab frame, is computed using the relativistic velocity transformation formula. This formula is (u - v) / (1 - (uv/c^2)), where u is the velocity of the 3m astronaut (0.5c) in the lab frame, and v is the velocity of the lab frame relative to the 2m astronaut's rest frame (0.6c). The relative velocity is thus (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c)(0.6c)/c^2), which simplifies to (-0.1c) / (1 - 0.3c^2/c^2), or (-0.1c) / (0.7).
This calculation results in a relative velocity of -0.1c / 0.7, approximately -0.1429c, indicating the 3m astronaut is moving at approximately 0.1429c in the negative x-direction relative to the 2m astronaut.

2: The relative velocity of the 2m astronaut (moving at 0.6c in Earth's frame) as observed from the rest frame of the 3m astronaut (moving at 0.5c in Earth's frame) is calculated using the relativistic velocity subtraction formula v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1v2/c2), where v1 = 0.6c and v2 = 0.5c. This yields v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c)(0.5c)/c2) = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3) = (0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c, or approximately 0.14c.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The relative velocity of the 3m astronaut as observed from the 2m astronaut's rest frame is approximately -0.1428c. Conversely, the relative velocity of the 2m astronaut as observed from the 3m astronaut's rest frame is approximately 0.1428c.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Wait, but since they are moving in the same direction, from the perspective of the faster astronaut (2m at 0.6c), the other astronaut (3m at 0.5c) is moving away in the opposite direction (negative x-direction) with speed approximately 0.14c. However, relative speed is typically a positive quantity, so the magnitude would be 0.14c. Similarly, from the slower astronaut's frame (3m at 0.5c), the faster one (2m at 0.6c) is moving away at the same relative speed of 0.14c. Therefore, the relative speed is 0.14c. So that would correspond to either option B or D.
Now, let's check the total energy of the system. The total energy of the system should be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut in the given reference frame. Since the problem doesn't specify, I assume it's the lab frame where both are moving in the positive x-direction with speeds 0.6c and 0.5c. Therefore, the total energy E is the sum of the gamma factors multiplied by their rest energies.

1: The relativistic energy of the 2m astronaut is calculated using the formula E = γmc^2, where m is the mass. The mass of the astronaut is 2m. The Lorentz factor γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). With v = 0.6c, γ becomes 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1.25. The energy E for the 2m astronaut is then 2m * 1.25c^2 = 2.5mc^2.

2: The relativistic energy of the 3m astronaut, moving at 0.5c, is calculated.

The relativistic energy E2 is then γ * (3m)c^2, resulting in approximately 1.1547 * 3m c^2 ≈ 3.4641 mc^2.

The relativistic energy of the 2m astronaut moving at 0.6c is 2.5mc^2, and the relativistic energy of the 3m astronaut moving at 0.5c is approximately 3.4641mc^2.

So total energy E_total = 2.5 mc^2 + 3.4641 mc^2 ≈ 5.9641 mc^2. So approximately 5.96 mc^2. Therefore, the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc^2. Looking at the options: A) v_rel=0.1c, E=4.96 mc^2. B) v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc^2. C) v_rel=1.1c, E=mc^2. D) v_rel=0.14c, E=5 mc^2. So the relative speed is 0.14c, and the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc^2. Therefore, the answer should be B.

The relativistic energy of the 2m astronaut moving at 0.6c is precisely 2.5mc², and the relativistic energy of the 3m astronaut moving at 0.5c is approximately 3.4641mc².

Therefore, total energy is 2.5 + 3.4641 = 5.9641 mc^2, which rounds to 5.96 mc^2, matching option B. So the correct answer is B. But wait, option D has E=5mc^2, which is different. So, the answer is B.
Wait, but another thought: Is the total energy supposed to be in the center-of-momentum frame or the lab frame? The problem states "the total energy of the system." By default, without specifying a reference frame, it's usually assumed to be in the given lab frame where their velocities are specified. So we can proceed with adding their relativistic energies in the lab frame. But just to confirm, the total energy of the system should be the sum of their individual relativistic energies in the same reference frame. Since both velocities are given in the positive x-direction in some reference frame (assumed lab frame), then yes, adding their energies there is correct. Alternatively, if they wanted the rest frame energy, that would be different, but since both are moving, the minimum total energy is in the center-of-mass frame, but the problem doesn't mention that. Therefore, likely, the total energy here is the sum in the given frame where their speeds are provided. Therefore, the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc^2, and the relative speed is 0.14c. So the answer is B. Therefore, the final answer is B.
</Think>

Answer: To determine the relative speed and total energy of the system, we start by calculating the relative velocity using the relativistic velocity subtraction formula. Given that both astronauts are moving in the same direction (positive x-direction) with velocities \(0.6c\) and \(0.5c\) in the lab frame, the relative speed \(v_{\text{rel}}\) is calculated as follows:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - (0.6c)(0.5c)/c^2} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c
\]

This simplifies to approximately \(0.14c\).

Next, we calculate the total energy of the system by summing the relativistic energies of each astronaut in the lab frame. The relativistic energy for each astronaut is given by \(E = \gamma mc^2\), where \(\gamma\) is the Lorentz factor.

For the astronaut with mass \(2m\) moving at \(0.6c\):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25 \quad \Rightarrow \quad E_1 = 1.25 \times 2mc^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

For the astronaut with mass \(3m\) moving at \(0.5c\):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547 \quad \Rightarrow \quad E_2 \approx 1.1547 \times 3mc^2 \approx 3.4641mc^2
\]

Summing these energies gives the total energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} \approx 2.5mc^2 + 3.4641mc^2 \approx 5.9641mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\) and the total energy is approximately \(5.96mc^2\), corresponding to option B.

The final answer is \boxed{B}.

2: the relativistic energy of the 3m astronaut is computed using e = γmc², where m is the mass. for a mass of 3m and velocity v = 0.5c, the lorentz factor γ is calculated as 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5c)²/c²), which simplifies to 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75), approximately 1.1547. the energy e for this astronaut is then 1.1547 multiplied by 3m c², resulting in approximately 3.4641 mc².

the relativistic energy of the 2m astronaut moving at 0.6c is precisely 2.5mc², and the relativistic energy of the 3m astronaut moving at 0.5c is approximately 3.4641mc².

therefore, total energy is 2.5 + 3.4641 = 5.9641 mc^2, which rounds to 5.96 mc^2, matching option b. so the correct answer is b. but wait, option d has e=5mc^2, which is different. so, the answer is b.
wait, but another thought: is the total energy supposed to be in the center-of-momentum frame or the lab frame? the problem states "the total energy of the system." by default, without specifying a reference frame, it's usually assumed to be in the given lab frame where their velocities are specified. so we can proceed with adding their relativistic energies in the lab frame. but just to confirm, the total energy of the system should be the sum of their individual relativistic energies in the same reference frame. since both velocities are given in the positive x-direction in some reference frame (assumed lab frame), then yes, adding their energies there is correct. alternatively, if they wanted the rest frame energy, that would be different, but since both are moving, the minimum total energy is in the center-of-mass frame, but the problem doesn't mention that. therefore, likely, the total energy here is the sum in the given frame where their speeds are provided. therefore, the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc^2, and the relative speed is 0.14c. so the answer is b. therefore, the final answer is b.

answer: to determine the relative speed and total energy of the system, we start by calculating the relative velocity using the relativistic velocity subtraction formula. given that both astronauts are moving in the same direction (positive x-direction) with velocities \(0.6c\) and \(0.5c\) in the lab frame, the relative speed \(v_{\text{rel}}\) is calculated as follows:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - (0.6c)(0.5c)/c^2} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c
\]

this simplifies to approximately \(0.14c\).

next, we calculate the total energy of the system by summing the relativistic energies of each astronaut in the lab frame. the relativistic energy for each astronaut is given by \(e = \gamma mc^2\), where \(\gamma\) is the lorentz factor.

for the astronaut with mass \(2m\) moving at \(0.6c\):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25 \quad \rightarrow \quad e_1 = 1.25 \times 2mc^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

for the astronaut with mass \(3m\) moving at \(0.5c\):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547 \quad \rightarrow \quad e_2 \approx 1.1547 \times 3mc^2 \approx 3.4641mc^2
\]

summing these energies gives the total energy:
\[
e_{\text{total}} \approx 2.5mc^2 + 3.4641mc^2 \approx 5.9641mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\) and the total energy is approximately \(5.96mc^2\), corresponding to option b.

the final answer is \boxed{b}
