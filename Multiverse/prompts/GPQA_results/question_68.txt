Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about a spin 1/2 particle and magnetic fields.
Let me try to unpack this step by step.
First, the problem describes a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment μ that's equal to γ times Sz.
The particle's magnetic moment is aligned with an initial magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction.
Then, suddenly, the original field is turned off, and a new one is turned on along the +Y direction, with the same magnitude B.
The question is asking about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle’s magnetic moment after this change.
The options are A) γB, B) γB/2, C) γB/sqrt(2), D) sqrt(2)γB.
Alright, so I need to recall how a spin 1/2 particle behaves in a magnetic field.
The magnetic moment is proportional to the spin operator, right?
So the Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is usually H = -μ·B.
But in this case, the problem says μ = γ Sz, so maybe they've already considered the negative sign or something?
Hmm.
Let me make sure.
The standard Hamiltonian for a spin in a magnetic field is H = -γ B_z S_z, but when the field is turned off and then reapplied in another direction, the Hamiltonian changes.
Wait, the initial magnetic field is in the +Z direction, so when the particle is aligned with it, the system is in the eigenstate of S_z with eigenvalue +ħ/2 (since it's spin up).
Then, suddenly, the field is turned off and then turned on in the +Y direction.
So the Hamiltonian changes abruptly from H_initial = -γ B S_z to H_final = -γ B S_y, but since the magnetic field is now in the +Y direction.
Wait, but the problem says the magnetic moment is μ = γ S_z.
Hmm, maybe that's a bit different.
Let me check the units.
Wait, magnetic moment μ is usually related to the spin by μ = γ S, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio.
So perhaps in this problem, they define μ as γ times S_z.
So maybe in the initial case, the magnetic moment is aligned along z, and when the field is rotated to the y-direction, the Hamiltonian will involve S_y.
But maybe the key point here is that after the field is switched to +Y direction, the system's Hamiltonian is now proportional to S_y.
But the particle was initially in an eigenstate of S_z (either up or down).
So when the Hamiltonian suddenly changes, the time evolution of the system will be governed by the new Hamiltonian.
The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle’s moment.
So we need to compute the expectation value of μ_z (which is γ S_z) in the time-evolved state and find its oscillation frequency.
Let me break it down:
1. **Initial State**: Before the magnetic field is switched, the particle is aligned with the +Z field, so it's in the eigenstate of S_z with eigenvalue +ħ/2 (|↑⟩).
2. **Time Zero**: The Z field is turned off, and the Y field is turned on.
At t=0, the Hamiltonian suddenly becomes H = -γ B S_y (assuming the problem didn't flip the sign; since the magnetic moment is μ = γ S_z, then H = -μ·B would be -γ S_z B_y? Wait, if the B field is now in the +Y direction, then H should be -μ·B = -γ S_z B_y.
But S_z is along the z-axis, so the dot product between S_z and B_y would be zero?
That doesn't make sense.
Wait, maybe there's confusion here.
Wait, perhaps the problem statement is that the magnetic moment is μ = γ S_z, regardless of the applied field's direction.
But when the field is applied along the Y direction, the torque tries to align the moment along the Y direction, but since μ is along z initially, there's precession.
Alternatively, maybe the Hamiltonian is H = -μ·B, so if μ = γ S_z, then H = -γ S_z B.
If B is in the z-direction, that's straightforward.
If B is suddenly switched to the y-direction, then H becomes -γ S_z B_y.
But S_z and B_y are perpendicular?
Wait, how does that work?
Wait, S_z is the z-component of spin, but if the magnetic field is in the y-direction, then the Hamiltonian would be H = -μ·B = -γ S_z · B_y.
But since S_z is along z and B is along y, their dot product is zero.
That seems weird.
Wait, that can't be right.
Wait, maybe the problem actually assumes that the magnetic moment is μ = γ S, which would be a vector.
Then, when the magnetic field is in the +Z direction, μ aligns along Z, so μ = γ S_z.
But if the field is switched to +Y, then the magnetic moment would start precessing around the Y axis.
But in quantum mechanics, the spin state evolves under the new Hamiltonian.
Wait, perhaps the initial magnetic field being in the +Z direction caused the magnetic moment to align along Z, so the system is in the eigenstate of S_z.
Then, when the field is turned off and a new one is turned on in the +Y direction, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -μ·B = -γ S_y B, assuming μ = γ S and B is along Y.
Wait, that might make sense.
If μ is γ times the spin vector, then the dot product S·B would involve components.
If B is along Z, then H = -γ B S_z.
If B is along Y, then H = -γ B S_y.
So when the field is switched, the Hamiltonian switches from S_z to S_y.
But the problem here defines μ = γ S_z.
Hmm, maybe that's different.
Wait, that's probably the key point of confusion.
Let me read the problem again:
"there is a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu (= gamma*Sz), aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction."
So, the magnetic moment is specifically given as gamma times Sz.
So mu is a vector, but here it's being defined as only along the z-axis, gamma times Sz.
That seems odd, because normally magnetic moment is proportional to the total spin vector.
But maybe in this problem, they consider the initial magnetic field along Z locks the magnetic moment along Z, so when the field is switched to Y, the magnetic moment is still tied to Sz?
Wait, but that seems non-relativistic and classical.
Alternatively, perhaps it's a problem where the magnetic moment is fixed along the z-axis, but the applied magnetic field is changed.
However, that doesn't make complete physical sense, because the magnetic moment is usually a vector aligned with the spin.
Wait, maybe in the initial situation, the particle is in a magnetic field in the Z direction, causing its magnetic moment to align along Z (i.e., it's in the eigenstate of S_z).
Then, when the field is switched to Y, the magnetic moment will start precessing around the new field direction.
But in quantum mechanics, when you change the Hamiltonian abruptly, the system remains in the same state but starts evolving under the new Hamiltonian.
So if the initial state is an eigenstate of S_z (either + or -), and the new Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y, then the time evolution will involve a rotation in the x-z plane?
Wait, but S_y is the y-component of spin.
Let me recall that the Pauli matrices are S_x, S_y, S_z.
If the initial state is |↑⟩_z (eigenstate of S_z with eigenvalue +ħ/2), and the Hamiltonian becomes H = -γ B S_y, then the time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H t / ħ) = exp(i γ B S_y t / ħ).
So the state at time t will be |ψ(t)⟩ = U(t) |↑⟩_z.
Then, to find the average of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is γ times the expectation of S_z.
So ⟨μ_z⟩ = γ ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩.
So we need to compute this expectation value and see if it oscillates, and find the frequency.
Alternatively, maybe using the rotating frame or some other approach.
Let me try the direct calculation.
First, let's note that γ has units of frequency per magnetic field (like MHz/Tesla), so the product γ B will have units of frequency (Hz).
Looking at the answer choices, all options except maybe C and D scale linearly with γ B.
But we need to compute the actual frequency.
Let's proceed.
Given that the initial state is |↑⟩_z = (1, 0)^T.
The Hamiltonian after t=0 is H = -γ B S_y, so the time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H t / ħ) = exp(i γ B S_y t / ħ).
Wait, S_y is a matrix.
The Pauli matrix for y is σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]] multiplied by ħ/2 for the spin operator.
So S_y = ħ/2 σ_y.
Therefore, H = -γ B ħ/2 σ_y.
Wait, perhaps we need to adjust the units.
Let me write S_y in terms of its matrix.
Let me set ħ = 1 for simplicity, since we'll have factors like exp(-i H t) and then we can reinsert ħ if necessary.
But perhaps better to keep track of ħ.
Wait, the Hamiltonian is H = -μ · B.
If μ = γ S_z, then H = -γ S_z B(t).
But when the magnetic field is switched from +Z to +Y, does that mean the field itself is in Y direction, so the Hamiltonian becomes H = -γ S_z B_y?
But that would be problematic because S_z and B_y are perpendicular.
Wait, no, the magnetic field is a vector.
If the magnetic field is now in the +Y direction with magnitude B, then the Hamiltonian should be H = -μ · B = -γ S_z · B \hat{y} .
But the dot product of S_z (which is along z) and \hat{y} is zero.
So H would be zero?
That can't be.
So there must be a misunderstanding here.
Wait, no, the magnetic moment is a vector operator.
Wait, in quantum mechanics, the magnetic moment operator is μ = γ \vec{S}.
So it has components μ_x = γ S_x, μ_y = γ S_y, μ_z = γ S_z.
So when the particle is in a magnetic field B, the Hamiltonian is H = -μ · B = -γ (S_x B_x + S_y B_y + S_z B_z).
In the initial situation, the magnetic field is in the +Z direction, so B = (0, 0, B).
Thus, H_initial = -γ B S_z.
The particle is aligned with the field, so it's in the eigenstate of S_z with eigenvalue +ħ/2.
Then, at t=0, the field is turned off and a new field is turned on in the +Y direction.
So now B = (0, B, 0).
Thus, H_final = -γ B S_y.
So the Hamiltonian becomes H = -γ B S_y.
Therefore, the problem is that the initial state is |↑⟩_z, and after t=0, the system evolves under H = -γ B S_y.
Then, the average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is ⟨μ_z⟩ = γ ⟨S_z⟩.
So we need to find the time dependence of ⟨S_z⟩ and determine its oscillation frequency.
Yes, this makes more sense.
So the initial state is |ψ(0)⟩ = |↑⟩_z.
Then, under the new Hamiltonian H = -γ B S_y, the state evolves as:
|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-i H t / ħ) |↑⟩_z.
But since H = -γ B S_y, the time evolution operator is:
U(t) = exp(i γ B S_y t / ħ).
Now, to compute this exponential, we can use the fact that S_y is a Pauli matrix multiplied by ħ/2.
So S_y = ħ/2 σ_y, where σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]].
Therefore, H = -γ B (ħ/2) σ_y.
Then, the time evolution operator is:
U(t) = exp(i γ B (ħ/2) σ_y t / ħ ) = exp(i (γ B /2) σ_y t ).
Since σ_y is a dimensionless matrix, the argument of the exponential must be dimensionless.
Wait, but we need to check the units here.
Wait, γ has units of [frequency]/[magnetic field], so γ B has units of frequency (Hz).
Then, in the Hamiltonian, H = -γ B S_y, since S_y is dimensionless in terms of operator, but actually, S_y has units of [action] (since S has units of J s, or ħ times dimensionless).
Wait, perhaps this is getting confusing.
Let me re-express H in terms of angular frequency.
Typically, the Hamiltonian for a spin in a magnetic field is H = -μ · B, and μ = γ ħ S /2.
So then H = - (γ ħ /2) B · S.
Then, if B is in the y-direction, H = - (γ ħ /2) B S_y.
Therefore, H = (γ ħ /2) B S_y with a sign?
Wait, no, because S_y is a Hermitian matrix (the Pauli matrix multiplied by ħ/2), so the actual expression is H = -μ_y B_y = - (γ S_y ħ /2 ) B.
Therefore, H = - (γ B ħ /2 ) S_y.
Hmm.
Then, the time evolution operator is:
U(t) = exp(-i H t / ħ ) = exp( i (γ B ħ /2 ) S_y t / ħ ) = exp( i (γ B / 2 ) S_y t ).
Since S_y in units of ħ/2, perhaps it's better to write σ_y instead.
So S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y, so substituting back:
H = -γ B (ħ/2) σ_y.
Therefore, H = -(γ B ħ / 2 ) σ_y.
Therefore, the time evolution operator is:
U(t) = exp(-i H t / ħ ) = exp( i (γ B / 2 ) σ_y t ).
Now, σ_y is a matrix, so we need to compute the exponential of a matrix.
For any 2x2 matrix i θ σ_y, the exponential is cosθ I + i σ_y sinθ.
Wait, let me check:
exp(i θ σ_y) = I cosθ + i σ_y sinθ.
Yes, because the exponential of i θ σ_y is analogous to Euler's formula.
So, σ_y is a matrix with eigenvalues ±1, and the expansion of the exponential can be written as a rotation matrix.
Therefore, exp(i θ σ_y) = cosθ I + i sinθ σ_y.
Therefore, our time evolution operator is:
U(t) = exp(i (γ B / 2 ) σ_y t ) = cos( (γ B / 2 ) t ) I + i sin( (γ B / 2 ) t ) σ_y.
But note that the original state is |↑⟩_z, which in the Pauli matrix notation is (1, 0) when using the z-basis.
However, σ_y matrix acts on this state.
Let me write |↑⟩_z as a vector:
|↑⟩_z = (1, 0)^T.
Then, applying U(t):
U(t) |↑⟩_z = [ cos( (γ B / 2 ) t ) I + i sin( (γ B / 2 ) t ) σ_y ] (1, 0)
First, I is the identity matrix, so cos( (γ B /2 ) t ) * (1, 0)^T.
Then, the second term: i sin( (γ B / 2 ) t ) σ_y (1, 0)^T.
Let's compute σ_y (1, 0)^T.
σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so multiplying by (1, 0)^T gives (-i*0 + 1*i ) = i.
Wait, wait:
σ_y acting on (1,0):
First component: 0*1 + (-i)*0 = 0
Second component: i*1 + 0*0 = i
Wait, no:
Wait, σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
So, multiplying by (1, 0)^T:
First component: 0*1 + (-i)*0 = 0
Second component: i*1 + 0*0 = i
So σ_y |↑⟩_z = (0, i)^T.
Therefore, the second term is i sin( (γ B /2 ) t ) multiplied by (0, i).
So:
i sin( (γ B /2 ) t ) * (0, i )^T = (0, i^2 sin( (γ B /2 ) t ))^T = (0, - sin( (γ B /2 ) t ), since i^2 = -1.
Therefore, combining both terms:
U(t) |↑⟩_z = ( cos( (γ B /2 ) t ), 0 )^T + ( 0, - sin( (γ B /2 ) t ) )^T = ( cos( (γ B /2 ) t ), - sin( (γ B /2 ) t ) )^T.
So the state at time t is:
|ψ(t)⟩ = ( cos( (γ B /2 ) t ), - sin( (γ B /2 ) t ) )^T.
Now, we need to compute the expectation value of μ_z, which is γ S_z.
Since μ_z = γ S_z, and S_z is ħ/2 times the Pauli matrix σ_z.
But to compute the expectation value, we can just use S_z as the matrix diag(ħ/2, -ħ/2), but since γ has ħ factored in probably, maybe we can write in terms of σ_z.
Wait, let me recall that S_z = ħ/2 σ_z.
So μ_z = γ S_z = γ (ħ/2) σ_z.
But when taking expectation values, the actual coefficient might not matter because we can factor it out.
Let's compute ⟨μ_z⟩ = γ ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩.
So first, let's compute ⟨ψ(t)| σ_z |ψ(t)⟩, then multiply by γ (ħ/2).
But let's see:
S_z = ħ/2 σ_z, so:
⟨μ_z⟩ = γ ⟨ψ(t)| S_z |ψ(t)⟩ = γ (ħ/2) ⟨ψ(t)| σ_z |ψ(t)⟩.
But let's just compute ⟨σ_z⟩ first.
The state |ψ(t)⟩ is ( cos( (γ B /2 ) t ), - sin( (γ B /2 ) t ) )^T.
So, the expectation value of σ_z is:
⟨σ_z⟩ = ( cos( (γ B /2 ) t ), sin( (γ B /2 ) t ) )  * σ_z  * ( cos( (γ B /2 ) t ), - sin( (γ B /2 ) t ) )
Note that the dagger of |ψ(t)⟩ is ( cos( (γ B /2 ) t ), sin( (γ B /2 ) t ) ), because the minus sign on the second component gets conjugated to positive.
But actually, wait:
The state vector is |ψ(t)⟩ = [ cos( (γ B /2 ) t ), - sin( (γ B /2 ) t ) ]^T.
So the bra ⟨ψ(t)| is the conjugate transpose, which is [ cos( (γ B /2 ) t ), - sin( (γ B /2 ) t ) ] since all coefficients are real.
Therefore:
⟨σ_z⟩ = [ cos, - sin ] σ_z [ cos; - sin ]
σ_z is diagonal with entries (1, -1).
So:
⟨σ_z⟩ = cos^2( (γ B /2 ) t ) * 1 + ( - sin ) * ( - sin ) * (-1)^2?
Wait, no:
Wait, σ_z is [[1, 0], [0, -1]].
So:
⟨σ_z⟩ = [ cos, - sin ] * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [ cos; - sin ]
First, multiply σ_z with the state vector:
σ_z |ψ(t)⟩ = [1* cos; -1*(- sin) ] = [ cos; sin ]
Then, take the inner product with ⟨ψ(t)| = [ cos, - sin ]:
⟨σ_z⟩ = [ cos, - sin ] • [ cos, sin ] = cos^2 - sin^2.
Wait, actually:
Wait:
Wait, the multiplication:
σ_z |ψ(t)⟩ = [[1,0],[0,-1]] * [ cos; - sin ] = [ cos; sin ]
Because: 1* cos + 0* (- sin ) = cos
0* cos + (-1)*(- sin ) = sin
Then, ⟨ψ(t)|σ_z |ψ(t)⟩ = [ cos, - sin ] • [ cos, sin ] = cos^2 - sin^2.
Wait, because:
cos * cos + (- sin )* sin = cos^2 - sin^2.
Therefore, ⟨σ_z⟩ = cos^2( (γ B /2 ) t ) - sin^2( (γ B /2 ) t )
Which is equal to cos( (γ B ) t ).
Because cos(2θ) = cos^2 θ - sin^2 θ.
Wait, but here it's:
Wait, if θ = (γ B /2 ) t, then:
cos^2 θ - sin^2 θ = cos(2θ) = cos( γ B t ).
Wait, but that would be:
Wait, θ = (γ B /2 ) t, so 2θ = (γ B ) t.
Therefore, ⟨σ_z⟩ = cos( γ B t ).
Therefore, ⟨σ_z⟩ = cos(γ B t ).
Therefore, ⟨μ_z⟩ = γ (ħ/2) cos(γ B t ).
Wait, but the problem says the magnetic moment is μ = γ S_z.
So μ_z = γ S_z.
Therefore, the expectation value ⟨μ_z⟩ = γ ⟨S_z⟩.
But S_z is (ħ/2) σ_z for spin-1/2.
Therefore, ⟨μ_z⟩ = γ (ħ/2) ) ⟨σ_z⟩.
But from our previous result, ⟨σ_z⟩ = cos(γ B t ).
Therefore:
⟨μ_z⟩ = ( γ ħ / 2 ) cos( γ B t ).
Wait, but according to the problem statement, the magnetic moment is given by μ = γ S_z.
Therefore, μ_z = γ S_z, so the expectation value is γ ⟨S_z⟩.
But S_z is an operator with eigenvalues ± ħ/2, so in this case, ⟨μ_z⟩ is γ times (ħ/2) cos(γ B t ).
Therefore, the amplitude of oscillation is γ (ħ/2), but the frequency of oscillation is γ B.
But the answer choices are in terms of frequency.
The question is asking for the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle’s moment.
From our calculation, it seems that the frequency is γ B, so answer A.
But wait, hold on.
Let me check again.
The time-dependent expectation value we found is ⟨μ_z⟩ = (γ ħ /2 ) cos( γ B t ).
Therefore, the oscillation is with frequency γ B.
But in the options, answer A is γ B.
However, is this correct?
Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the Hamiltonian.
Wait, the problem says that the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along +Y direction.
So when they turn off the original Z field and turn on the Y field, the new Hamiltonian is H = - μ · B_new.
Since μ = γ S_z (as per problem statement), and B_new is in +Y direction.
Therefore, H = - γ S_z * B_y.
But S_z and B_y are along different axes.
The dot product between S_z and B_y would be zero.
So H = 0?
That can't be right.
Wait, perhaps this is a trick in the question.
If the magnetic moment is μ = γ S_z (fixed along z), and the magnetic field is now along Y, then the Hamiltonian H = -μ · B = - γ S_z B_y.
Since S_z is diagonal in the z-basis and B is along Y, then H would be a matrix with elements depending on S_z.
Wait, but S_z doesn't affect the Y component of the field?
Hmm, no, in reality, if the magnetic moment is fixed along Z and the field is along Y, their dot product is zero, so the Hamiltonian is zero.
But that contradicts the problem statement, which says that the average z-component starts oscillating.
So there must be something wrong with this assumption.
Therefore, perhaps the problem actually intended that the magnetic moment is μ = γ S (i.e., vectorial), and it was initially aligned along Z due to the Z field.
Then, when the field is switched to Y, the magnetic moment starts precessing around the Y axis.
In that case, even though the magnetic moment is a vector, in quantum mechanics, when you switch the Hamiltonian, the state evolves under the new Hamiltonian.
But if μ is γ S, then the initial alignment along Z means the state was |↑⟩_z.
Then, switching the Hamiltonian to H = -μ · B = -γ S_y B.
So same as before.
Therefore, my previous analysis holds, and the oscillation frequency is γ B.
But according to the problem, μ = gamma*S_z, not gamma*S.
So maybe the answer is indeed A.
However, the problem says that when the field is turned off and another is turned on along Y, the average z-component starts oscillating.
If H = 0, because the moment is along Z and field along Y, then there would be no oscillation.
So this suggests that perhaps the problem actually has μ = γ S, and the initial alignment was in Z, but when the field is switched to Y, the precession occurs.
Therefore, the problem might have a typo in stating μ = gamma*S_z; perhaps it's a typo and should be μ = gamma S.
But assuming that it's written correctly, then how do we interpret this?
Wait, perhaps another approach.
Suppose the magnetic moment is μ = γ S_z, fixed along Z.
Then, when the magnetic field is applied along Y, the torque on the magnetic moment is given by the cross product of μ and B.
But in classical physics, the torque is dμ/dt = μ × B.
If μ is along Z and B is along Y, then dμ/dt is along X.
So the magnetic moment would start precessing around the B field (Y axis), with the tip of μ tracing a circle in the XZ plane.
However, in quantum mechanics, for a spin-1/2 particle, precession is different because the spin state evolves under the Hamiltonian.
But if H = -μ · B = 0 (since μ is along Z and B along Y), then there's no change.
That's contradictory.
Therefore, this suggests that the problem's magnetic moment isn't fixed along Z but is a vector.
So despite the problem stating μ = gamma*S_z, perhaps that's meant to be the initial alignment, but when the field is switched, the system's state isn't an eigenstate of S_z anymore.
But this is confusing.
Alternatively, maybe they use a different convention.
Wait, perhaps when they say the magnetic moment is mu = gamma*S_z, they mean that the magnetic moment operator is gamma times the S_z operator.
So in the new magnetic field along Y, the Hamiltonian is H = -mu·B = -gamma S_z B_y.
But S_z in the Y field?
Since B_y is in the Y direction, and S_z is the Z-component of spin.
So H = -gamma B_y S_z.
But unless B_y is zero, but B is non-zero in Y direction.
Wait, if B is along Y with magnitude B, then B_y = B.
So H = - gamma B S_z.
But that would mean the Hamiltonian is the same as before, but no, the original field was along Z.
Wait, no.
Wait, perhaps when the field is turned off and then turned on in the Y direction, the new B field is in Y.
So the Hamiltonian is H = -mu·B = -gamma S_z · B_y.
So S_z times B_y.
Since S_z and B_y are along different axes, how does this product work?
Wait, S_z is a component of spin along Z.
If B is along Y, then the dot product mu·B is (gamma S_z) * B, but only if mu and B are vectors.
Wait, no.
The dot product is S_z (component along Z) and B (component along Y).
So S_z * B_y + S_y * B_z, etc.
But if mu = gamma S_z, that would imply that the magnetic moment only has a Z component, so mu·B is gamma S_z B_y.
Therefore, H = -gamma S_z B_y.
But if the magnetic field is in the Y direction with magnitude B, then B_y = B.
So H = -gamma S_z B.
But that would mean the Hamiltonian is the same as when the field was along Z?
But no, because when the field was along Z, mu·B would be gamma S_z B_z = gamma S_z B (since B was along Z).
But now, if B is along Y, then H = -gamma S_z B.
Wait, but S_z is diagonal in the z-basis, so if the system was in an eigenstate of S_z, say |↑⟩, then under H = -gamma S_z B, the state would just pick up a phase.
But in this case, the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma S_z B.
But if the initial state is |↑⟩, with S_z eigenvalue +ħ/2, then the energy is E = -gamma * (+ħ/2) * B.
So the state would evolve as |↑⟩ e^{-i E t / ħ} = |↑⟩ e^{i gamma B t /2 }.
So there's no oscillation in expectation value of S_z, because the state remains |↑⟩.
Therefore, ⟨μ_z⟩ = gamma * (ħ/2) would be static.
But this contradicts the problem statement which says that the average z-component starts oscillating.
Therefore, this suggests that my initial assumption is wrong: the problem states μ = gamma S_z, but when the field is turned off and the Y field is turned on, the Hamiltonian is not H = -mu·B = -gamma S_z B, but rather H = -mu·B = -gamma S_y B.
That is, perhaps mu is gamma S (vector), so when aligned along Z, it's because the initial B was along Z, but when B is along Y, the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma S_y B.
This would explain why the expectation value oscillates.
So maybe the problem has a typo in the definition of magnetic moment, or maybe they use a different convention.
Alternatively, in the problem statement, "aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction", so the magnetic moment is aligned along Z, so the state is |↑⟩_z.
Then, when the field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y.
So, in reality, when you switch off the Z field and switch on the Y field, the Hamiltonian changes from H_initial = -mu*B_z to H_final = -mu*B_y.
If the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z, then H_initial = -gamma S_z B_z.
When you turn off B_z and turn on B_y, H_final = -gamma S_z B_y.
But S_z and B_y are along different axes.
So H_final is a non-diagonal matrix in the z-basis.
Wait, let's see.
Suppose S_z in matrix form is [[ ħ/2, 0 ], [ 0, -ħ/2 ]], and B_y is a c-number.
But how does S_z multiply with B_y?
If B_y is in the Y direction, then the Hamiltonian H = -mu·B = -gamma S_z B_y.
But S_z is along Z, so the dot product is scalar.
So in this case, H = - gamma S_z B_y.
But S_z is a matrix, so H is a matrix proportional to S_z.
Wait, but if B is along Y, then the component of B along Z is zero, so H = - gamma S_z * 0 = 0?
That can't be.
Wait, no.
The magnetic field is B along Y.
So the dot product mu·B is mu_x B_x + mu_y B_y + mu_z B_z.
If mu = gamma S_z (i.e., only mu_z component: gamma S_z, and mu_x = mu_y =0), then mu·B = gamma S_z * B_y * delta_{yz} = 0, since B is along y and mu is along z.
So mu·B = 0.
Therefore, H = 0.
So there's no Hamiltonian, so the system doesn't evolve.
Therefore, expectation value remains constant.
But the problem says the average z-component starts oscillating.
This contradicts.
Therefore, the problem must have intended that the magnetic moment is a vector mu = gamma S, and when the field is applied along Y, the Hamiltonian is H = -mu·B = -gamma S_y B.
Therefore, even if the particle was aligned along Z, once the field is switched to Y, the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma S_y B.
Therefore, the system will start evolving under H proportional to S_y.
Therefore, my original calculation holds, where the oscillation frequency is gamma B.
So answer A.
However, given the problem states mu = gamma S_z, not mu = gamma S, so perhaps the answer is different.
Wait, perhaps the key here is that when the field is applied in the Y direction, the torque causes the magnetization to precess around the Y axis.
In classical terms, the angular frequency is gamma B.
However, in quantum mechanics, for a spin-1/2 particle, the precession manifests as Rabi oscillations.
The Rabi frequency is typically given by omega_R = gamma B, for a transverse field.
Wait, but in the case where the field is perpendicular to the initial magnetization, the Rabi frequency is gamma B.
So in this case, if the initial magnetization is along Z and the field is applied along Y, the oscillation frequency would be gamma B.
Therefore, the answer is A.
But let's verify this via quantum mechanical calculation.
Assume H = -mu·B.
If mu = gamma S_z, then H = -gamma S_z B_y.
But S_z is diagonal in the z-basis.
Let's express H in that basis.
S_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]] (in units of ħ/2).
But H = -gamma B S_z (assuming B is along y? Wait, B is a vector (0, B, 0).
So H = -mu·B = -gamma S_z * B_y.
So H = -gamma B S_z.
But S_z here is the z-component spin matrix.
So H is a diagonal matrix with entries (-gamma B (ħ/2), gamma B (ħ/2)).
Therefore, the eigenstates of H are |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ with eigenvalues E_up = -gamma B (ħ/2) and E_down = gamma B (ħ/2).
So if the system starts in |↑⟩, it stays in |↑⟩, acquiring a phase.
But then ⟨S_z⟩ remains (ħ/2), so constant.
But this contradicts the problem statement.
Therefore, the problem must have intended that the magnetic moment is a vector.
So mu = gamma S.
Then, when the field is along Y, H = -mu·

okay, so i have this quantum mechanics problem here about a spin 1/2 particle and magnetic fields.
let me try to unpack this step by step.
first, the problem describes a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment μ that's equal to γ times sz.
the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with an initial magnetic field pointing in the +z direction.
then, suddenly, the original field is turned off, and a new one is turned on along the +y direction, with the same magnitude b.
the question is asking about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle’s magnetic moment after this change.
the options are a) γb, b) γb/2, c) γb/sqrt(2), d) sqrt(2)γb.
alright, so i need to recall how a spin 1/2 particle behaves in a magnetic field.
the magnetic moment is proportional to the spin operator, right?
so the hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is usually h = -μ·b.
but in this case, the problem says μ = γ sz, so maybe they've already considered the negative sign or something?
hmm.
let me make sure.
the standard hamiltonian for a spin in a magnetic field is h = -γ b_z s_z, but when the field is turned off and then reapplied in another direction, the hamiltonian changes.
wait, the initial magnetic field is in the +z direction, so when the particle is aligned with it, the system is in the eigenstate of s_z with eigenvalue +ħ/2 (since it's spin up).
then, suddenly, the field is turned off and then turned on in the +y direction.
so the hamiltonian changes abruptly from h_initial = -γ b s_z to h_final = -γ b s_y, but since the magnetic field is now in the +y direction.
wait, but the problem says the magnetic moment is μ = γ s_z.
hmm, maybe that's a bit different.
let me check the units.
wait, magnetic moment μ is usually related to the spin by μ = γ s, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio.
so perhaps in this problem, they define μ as γ times s_z.
so maybe in the initial case, the magnetic moment is aligned along z, and when the field is rotated to the y-direction, the hamiltonian will involve s_y.
but maybe the key point here is that after the field is switched to +y direction, the system's hamiltonian is now proportional to s_y.
but the particle was initially in an eigenstate of s_z (either up or down).
so when the hamiltonian suddenly changes, the time evolution of the system will be governed by the new hamiltonian.
the question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle’s moment.
so we need to compute the expectation value of μ_z (which is γ s_z) in the time-evolved state and find its oscillation frequency.
let me break it down:
1. **initial state**: before the magnetic field is switched, the particle is aligned with the +z field, so it's in the eigenstate of s_z with eigenvalue +ħ/2 (|↑⟩).
2. **time zero**: the z field is turned off, and the y field is turned on.
at t=0, the hamiltonian suddenly becomes h = -γ b s_y (assuming the problem didn't flip the sign; since the magnetic moment is μ = γ s_z, then h = -μ·b would be -γ s_z b_y? wait, if the b field is now in the +y direction, then h should be -μ·b = -γ s_z b_y.
but s_z is along the z-axis, so the dot product between s_z and b_y would be zero?
that doesn't make sense.
wait, maybe there's confusion here.
wait, perhaps the problem statement is that the magnetic moment is μ = γ s_z, regardless of the applied field's direction.
but when the field is applied along the y direction, the torque tries to align the moment along the y direction, but since μ is along z initially, there's precession.
alternatively, maybe the hamiltonian is h = -μ·b, so if μ = γ s_z, then h = -γ s_z b.
if b is in the z-direction, that's straightforward.
if b is suddenly switched to the y-direction, then h becomes -γ s_z b_y.
but s_z and b_y are perpendicular?
wait, how does that work?
wait, s_z is the z-component of spin, but if the magnetic field is in the y-direction, then the hamiltonian would be h = -μ·b = -γ s_z · b_y.
but since s_z is along z and b is along y, their dot product is zero.
that seems weird.
wait, that can't be right.
wait, maybe the problem actually assumes that the magnetic moment is μ = γ s, which would be a vector.
then, when the magnetic field is in the +z direction, μ aligns along z, so μ = γ s_z.
but if the field is switched to +y, then the magnetic moment would start precessing around the y axis.
but in quantum mechanics, the spin state evolves under the new hamiltonian.
wait, perhaps the initial magnetic field being in the +z direction caused the magnetic moment to align along z, so the system is in the eigenstate of s_z.
then, when the field is turned off and a new one is turned on in the +y direction, the hamiltonian becomes h = -μ·b = -γ s_y b, assuming μ = γ s and b is along y.
wait, that might make sense.
if μ is γ times the spin vector, then the dot product s·b would involve components.
if b is along z, then h = -γ b s_z.
if b is along y, then h = -γ b s_y.
so when the field is switched, the hamiltonian switches from s_z to s_y.
but the problem here defines μ = γ s_z.
hmm, maybe that's different.
wait, that's probably the key point of confusion.
let me read the problem again:
"there is a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu (= gamma*sz), aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +z direction."
so, the magnetic moment is specifically given as gamma times sz.
so mu is a vector, but here it's being defined as only along the z-axis, gamma times sz.
that seems odd, because normally magnetic moment is proportional to the total spin vector.
but maybe in this problem, they consider the initial magnetic field along z locks the magnetic moment along z, so when the field is switched to y, the magnetic moment is still tied to sz?
wait, but that seems non-relativistic and classical.
alternatively, perhaps it's a problem where the magnetic moment is fixed along the z-axis, but the applied magnetic field is changed.
however, that doesn't make complete physical sense, because the magnetic moment is usually a vector aligned with the spin.
wait, maybe in the initial situation, the particle is in a magnetic field in the z direction, causing its magnetic moment to align along z (i.e., it's in the eigenstate of s_z).
then, when the field is switched to y, the magnetic moment will start precessing around the new field direction.
but in quantum mechanics, when you change the hamiltonian abruptly, the system remains in the same state but starts evolving under the new hamiltonian.
so if the initial state is an eigenstate of s_z (either + or -), and the new hamiltonian is proportional to s_y, then the time evolution will involve a rotation in the x-z plane?
wait, but s_y is the y-component of spin.
let me recall that the pauli matrices are s_x, s_y, s_z.
if the initial state is |↑⟩_z (eigenstate of s_z with eigenvalue +ħ/2), and the hamiltonian becomes h = -γ b s_y, then the time evolution operator is u(t) = exp(-i h t / ħ) = exp(i γ b s_y t / ħ).
so the state at time t will be |ψ(t)⟩ = u(t) |↑⟩_z.
then, to find the average of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is γ times the expectation of s_z.
so ⟨μ_z⟩ = γ ⟨ψ(t)| s_z |ψ(t)⟩.
so we need to compute this expectation value and see if it oscillates, and find the frequency.
alternatively, maybe using the rotating frame or some other approach.
let me try the direct calculation.
first, let's note that γ has units of frequency per magnetic field (like mhz/tesla), so the product γ b will have units of frequency (hz).
looking at the answer choices, all options except maybe c and d scale linearly with γ b.
but we need to compute the actual frequency.
let's proceed.
given that the initial state is |↑⟩_z = (1, 0)^t.
the hamiltonian after t=0 is h = -γ b s_y, so the time evolution operator is u(t) = exp(-i h t / ħ) = exp(i γ b s_y t / ħ).
wait, s_y is a matrix.
the pauli matrix for y is σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]] multiplied by ħ/2 for the spin operator.
so s_y = ħ/2 σ_y.
therefore, h = -γ b ħ/2 σ_y.
wait, perhaps we need to adjust the units.
let me write s_y in terms of its matrix.
let me set ħ = 1 for simplicity, since we'll have factors like exp(-i h t) and then we can reinsert ħ if necessary.
but perhaps better to keep track of ħ.
wait, the hamiltonian is h = -μ · b.
if μ = γ s_z, then h = -γ s_z b(t).
but when the magnetic field is switched from +z to +y, does that mean the field itself is in y direction, so the hamiltonian becomes h = -γ s_z b_y?
but that would be problematic because s_z and b_y are perpendicular.
wait, no, the magnetic field is a vector.
if the magnetic field is now in the +y direction with magnitude b, then the hamiltonian should be h = -μ · b = -γ s_z · b \hat{y} .
but the dot product of s_z (which is along z) and \hat{y} is zero.
so h would be zero?
that can't be.
so there must be a misunderstanding here.
wait, no, the magnetic moment is a vector operator.
wait, in quantum mechanics, the magnetic moment operator is μ = γ \vec{s}.
so it has components μ_x = γ s_x, μ_y = γ s_y, μ_z = γ s_z.
so when the particle is in a magnetic field b, the hamiltonian is h = -μ · b = -γ (s_x b_x + s_y b_y + s_z b_z).
in the initial situation, the magnetic field is in the +z direction, so b = (0, 0, b).
thus, h_initial = -γ b s_z.
the particle is aligned with the field, so it's in the eigenstate of s_z with eigenvalue +ħ/2.
then, at t=0, the field is turned off and a new field is turned on in the +y direction.
so now b = (0, b, 0).
thus, h_final = -γ b s_y.
so the hamiltonian becomes h = -γ b s_y.
therefore, the problem is that the initial state is |↑⟩_z, and after t=0, the system evolves under h = -γ b s_y.
then, the average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is ⟨μ_z⟩ = γ ⟨s_z⟩.
so we need to find the time dependence of ⟨s_z⟩ and determine its oscillation frequency.
yes, this makes more sense.
so the initial state is |ψ(0)⟩ = |↑⟩_z.
then, under the new hamiltonian h = -γ b s_y, the state evolves as:
|ψ(t)⟩ = exp(-i h t / ħ) |↑⟩_z.
but since h = -γ b s_y, the time evolution operator is:
u(t) = exp(i γ b s_y t / ħ).
now, to compute this exponential, we can use the fact that s_y is a pauli matrix multiplied by ħ/2.
so s_y = ħ/2 σ_y, where σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]].
therefore, h = -γ b (ħ/2) σ_y.
then, the time evolution operator is:
u(t) = exp(i γ b (ħ/2) σ_y t / ħ ) = exp(i (γ b /2) σ_y t ).
since σ_y is a dimensionless matrix, the argument of the exponential must be dimensionless.
wait, but we need to check the units here.
wait, γ has units of [frequency]/[magnetic field], so γ b has units of frequency (hz).
then, in the hamiltonian, h = -γ b s_y, since s_y is dimensionless in terms of operator, but actually, s_y has units of [action] (since s has units of j s, or ħ times dimensionless).
wait, perhaps this is getting confusing.
let me re-express h in terms of angular frequency.
typically, the hamiltonian for a spin in a magnetic field is h = -μ · b, and μ = γ ħ s /2.
so then h = - (γ ħ /2) b · s.
then, if b is in the y-direction, h = - (γ ħ /2) b s_y.
therefore, h = (γ ħ /2) b s_y with a sign?
wait, no, because s_y is a hermitian matrix (the pauli matrix multiplied by ħ/2), so the actual expression is h = -μ_y b_y = - (γ s_y ħ /2 ) b.
therefore, h = - (γ b ħ /2 ) s_y.
hmm.
then, the time evolution operator is:
u(t) = exp(-i h t / ħ ) = exp( i (γ b ħ /2 ) s_y t / ħ ) = exp( i (γ b / 2 ) s_y t ).
since s_y in units of ħ/2, perhaps it's better to write σ_y instead.
so s_y = (ħ/2) σ_y, so substituting back:
h = -γ b (ħ/2) σ_y.
therefore, h = -(γ b ħ / 2 ) σ_y.
therefore, the time evolution operator is:
u(t) = exp(-i h t / ħ ) = exp( i (γ b / 2 ) σ_y t ).
now, σ_y is a matrix, so we need to compute the exponential of a matrix.
for any 2x2 matrix i θ σ_y, the exponential is cosθ i + i σ_y sinθ.
wait, let me check:
exp(i θ σ_y) = i cosθ + i σ_y sinθ.
yes, because the exponential of i θ σ_y is analogous to euler's formula.
so, σ_y is a matrix with eigenvalues ±1, and the expansion of the exponential can be written as a rotation matrix.
therefore, exp(i θ σ_y) = cosθ i + i sinθ σ_y.
therefore, our time evolution operator is:
u(t) = exp(i (γ b / 2 ) σ_y t ) = cos( (γ b / 2 ) t ) i + i sin( (γ b / 2 ) t ) σ_y.
but note that the original state is |↑⟩_z, which in the pauli matrix notation is (1, 0) when using the z-basis.
however, σ_y matrix acts on this state.
let me write |↑⟩_z as a vector:
|↑⟩_z = (1, 0)^t.
then, applying u(t):
u(t) |↑⟩_z = [ cos( (γ b / 2 ) t ) i + i sin( (γ b / 2 ) t ) σ_y ] (1, 0)
first, i is the identity matrix, so cos( (γ b /2 ) t ) * (1, 0)^t.
then, the second term: i sin( (γ b / 2 ) t ) σ_y (1, 0)^t.
let's compute σ_y (1, 0)^t.
σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so multiplying by (1, 0)^t gives (-i*0 + 1*i ) = i.
wait, wait:
σ_y acting on (1,0):
first component: 0*1 + (-i)*0 = 0
second component: i*1 + 0*0 = i
wait, no:
wait, σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
so, multiplying by (1, 0)^t:
first component: 0*1 + (-i)*0 = 0
second component: i*1 + 0*0 = i
so σ_y |↑⟩_z = (0, i)^t.
therefore, the second term is i sin( (γ b /2 ) t ) multiplied by (0, i).
so:
i sin( (γ b /2 ) t ) * (0, i )^t = (0, i^2 sin( (γ b /2 ) t ))^t = (0, - sin( (γ b /2 ) t ), since i^2 = -1.
therefore, combining both terms:
u(t) |↑⟩_z = ( cos( (γ b /2 ) t ), 0 )^t + ( 0, - sin( (γ b /2 ) t ) )^t = ( cos( (γ b /2 ) t ), - sin( (γ b /2 ) t ) )^t.
so the state at time t is:
|ψ(t)⟩ = ( cos( (γ b /2 ) t ), - sin( (γ b /2 ) t ) )^t.
now, we need to compute the expectation value of μ_z, which is γ s_z.
since μ_z = γ s_z, and s_z is ħ/2 times the pauli matrix σ_z.
but to compute the expectation value, we can just use s_z as the matrix diag(ħ/2, -ħ/2), but since γ has ħ factored in probably, maybe we can write in terms of σ_z.
wait, let me recall that s_z = ħ/2 σ_z.
so μ_z = γ s_z = γ (ħ/2) σ_z.
but when taking expectation values, the actual coefficient might not matter because we can factor it out.
let's compute ⟨μ_z⟩ = γ ⟨ψ(t)| s_z |ψ(t)⟩.
so first, let's compute ⟨ψ(t)| σ_z |ψ(t)⟩, then multiply by γ (ħ/2).
but let's see:
s_z = ħ/2 σ_z, so:
⟨μ_z⟩ = γ ⟨ψ(t)| s_z |ψ(t)⟩ = γ (ħ/2) ⟨ψ(t)| σ_z |ψ(t)⟩.
but let's just compute ⟨σ_z⟩ first.
the state |ψ(t)⟩ is ( cos( (γ b /2 ) t ), - sin( (γ b /2 ) t ) )^t.
so, the expectation value of σ_z is:
⟨σ_z⟩ = ( cos( (γ b /2 ) t ), sin( (γ b /2 ) t ) )  * σ_z  * ( cos( (γ b /2 ) t ), - sin( (γ b /2 ) t ) )
note that the dagger of |ψ(t)⟩ is ( cos( (γ b /2 ) t ), sin( (γ b /2 ) t ) ), because the minus sign on the second component gets conjugated to positive.
but actually, wait:
the state vector is |ψ(t)⟩ = [ cos( (γ b /2 ) t ), - sin( (γ b /2 ) t ) ]^t.
so the bra ⟨ψ(t)| is the conjugate transpose, which is [ cos( (γ b /2 ) t ), - sin( (γ b /2 ) t ) ] since all coefficients are real.
therefore:
⟨σ_z⟩ = [ cos, - sin ] σ_z [ cos; - sin ]
σ_z is diagonal with entries (1, -1).
so:
⟨σ_z⟩ = cos^2( (γ b /2 ) t ) * 1 + ( - sin ) * ( - sin ) * (-1)^2?
wait, no:
wait, σ_z is [[1, 0], [0, -1]].
so:
⟨σ_z⟩ = [ cos, - sin ] * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [ cos; - sin ]
first, multiply σ_z with the state vector:
σ_z |ψ(t)⟩ = [1* cos; -1*(- sin) ] = [ cos; sin ]
then, take the inner product with ⟨ψ(t)| = [ cos, - sin ]:
⟨σ_z⟩ = [ cos, - sin ] • [ cos, sin ] = cos^2 - sin^2.
wait, actually:
wait:
wait, the multiplication:
σ_z |ψ(t)⟩ = [[1,0],[0,-1]] * [ cos; - sin ] = [ cos; sin ]
because: 1* cos + 0* (- sin ) = cos
0* cos + (-1)*(- sin ) = sin
then, ⟨ψ(t)|σ_z |ψ(t)⟩ = [ cos, - sin ] • [ cos, sin ] = cos^2 - sin^2.
wait, because:
cos * cos + (- sin )* sin = cos^2 - sin^2.
therefore, ⟨σ_z⟩ = cos^2( (γ b /2 ) t ) - sin^2( (γ b /2 ) t )
which is equal to cos( (γ b ) t ).
because cos(2θ) = cos^2 θ - sin^2 θ.
wait, but here it's:
wait, if θ = (γ b /2 ) t, then:
cos^2 θ - sin^2 θ = cos(2θ) = cos( γ b t ).
wait, but that would be:
wait, θ = (γ b /2 ) t, so 2θ = (γ b ) t.
therefore, ⟨σ_z⟩ = cos( γ b t ).
therefore, ⟨σ_z⟩ = cos(γ b t ).
therefore, ⟨μ_z⟩ = γ (ħ/2) cos(γ b t ).
wait, but the problem says the magnetic moment is μ = γ s_z.
so μ_z = γ s_z.
therefore, the expectation value ⟨μ_z⟩ = γ ⟨s_z⟩.
but s_z is (ħ/2) σ_z for spin-1/2.
therefore, ⟨μ_z⟩ = γ (ħ/2) ) ⟨σ_z⟩.
but from our previous result, ⟨σ_z⟩ = cos(γ b t ).
therefore:
⟨μ_z⟩ = ( γ ħ / 2 ) cos( γ b t ).
wait, but according to the problem statement, the magnetic moment is given by μ = γ s_z.
therefore, μ_z = γ s_z, so the expectation value is γ ⟨s_z⟩.
but s_z is an operator with eigenvalues ± ħ/2, so in this case, ⟨μ_z⟩ is γ times (ħ/2) cos(γ b t ).
therefore, the amplitude of oscillation is γ (ħ/2), but the frequency of oscillation is γ b.
but the answer choices are in terms of frequency.
the question is asking for the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle’s moment.
from our calculation, it seems that the frequency is γ b, so answer a.
but wait, hold on.
let me check again.
the time-dependent expectation value we found is ⟨μ_z⟩ = (γ ħ /2 ) cos( γ b t ).
therefore, the oscillation is with frequency γ b.
but in the options, answer a is γ b.
however, is this correct?
wait, maybe i made a mistake in the hamiltonian.
wait, the problem says that the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along +y direction.
so when they turn off the original z field and turn on the y field, the new hamiltonian is h = - μ · b_new.
since μ = γ s_z (as per problem statement), and b_new is in +y direction.
therefore, h = - γ s_z * b_y.
but s_z and b_y are along different axes.
the dot product between s_z and b_y would be zero.
so h = 0?
that can't be right.
wait, perhaps this is a trick in the question.
if the magnetic moment is μ = γ s_z (fixed along z), and the magnetic field is now along y, then the hamiltonian h = -μ · b = - γ s_z b_y.
since s_z is diagonal in the z-basis and b is along y, then h would be a matrix with elements depending on s_z.
wait, but s_z doesn't affect the y component of the field?
hmm, no, in reality, if the magnetic moment is fixed along z and the field is along y, their dot product is zero, so the hamiltonian is zero.
but that contradicts the problem statement, which says that the average z-component starts oscillating.
so there must be something wrong with this assumption.
therefore, perhaps the problem actually intended that the magnetic moment is μ = γ s (i.e., vectorial), and it was initially aligned along z due to the z field.
then, when the field is switched to y, the magnetic moment starts precessing around the y axis.
in that case, even though the magnetic moment is a vector, in quantum mechanics, when you switch the hamiltonian, the state evolves under the new hamiltonian.
but if μ is γ s, then the initial alignment along z means the state was |↑⟩_z.
then, switching the hamiltonian to h = -μ · b = -γ s_y b.
so same as before.
therefore, my previous analysis holds, and the oscillation frequency is γ b.
but according to the problem, μ = gamma*s_z, not gamma*s.
so maybe the answer is indeed a.
however, the problem says that when the field is turned off and another is turned on along y, the average z-component starts oscillating.
if h = 0, because the moment is along z and field along y, then there would be no oscillation.
so this suggests that perhaps the problem actually has μ = γ s, and the initial alignment was in z, but when the field is switched to y, the precession occurs.
therefore, the problem might have a typo in stating μ = gamma*s_z; perhaps it's a typo and should be μ = gamma s.
but assuming that it's written correctly, then how do we interpret this?
wait, perhaps another approach.
suppose the magnetic moment is μ = γ s_z, fixed along z.
then, when the magnetic field is applied along y, the torque on the magnetic moment is given by the cross product of μ and b.
but in classical physics, the torque is dμ/dt = μ × b.
if μ is along z and b is along y, then dμ/dt is along x.
so the magnetic moment would start precessing around the b field (y axis), with the tip of μ tracing a circle in the xz plane.
however, in quantum mechanics, for a spin-1/2 particle, precession is different because the spin state evolves under the hamiltonian.
but if h = -μ · b = 0 (since μ is along z and b along y), then there's no change.
that's contradictory.
therefore, this suggests that the problem's magnetic moment isn't fixed along z but is a vector.
so despite the problem stating μ = gamma*s_z, perhaps that's meant to be the initial alignment, but when the field is switched, the system's state isn't an eigenstate of s_z anymore.
but this is confusing.
alternatively, maybe they use a different convention.
wait, perhaps when they say the magnetic moment is mu = gamma*s_z, they mean that the magnetic moment operator is gamma times the s_z operator.
so in the new magnetic field along y, the hamiltonian is h = -mu·b = -gamma s_z b_y.
but s_z in the y field?
since b_y is in the y direction, and s_z is the z-component of spin.
so h = -gamma b_y s_z.
but unless b_y is zero, but b is non-zero in y direction.
wait, if b is along y with magnitude b, then b_y = b.
so h = - gamma b s_z.
but that would mean the hamiltonian is the same as before, but no, the original field was along z.
wait, no.
wait, perhaps when the field is turned off and then turned on in the y direction, the new b field is in y.
so the hamiltonian is h = -mu·b = -gamma s_z · b_y.
so s_z times b_y.
since s_z and b_y are along different axes, how does this product work?
wait, s_z is a component of spin along z.
if b is along y, then the dot product mu·b is (gamma s_z) * b, but only if mu and b are vectors.
wait, no.
the dot product is s_z (component along z) and b (component along y).
so s_z * b_y + s_y * b_z, etc.
but if mu = gamma s_z, that would imply that the magnetic moment only has a z component, so mu·b is gamma s_z b_y.
therefore, h = -gamma s_z b_y.
but if the magnetic field is in the y direction with magnitude b, then b_y = b.
so h = -gamma s_z b.
but that would mean the hamiltonian is the same as when the field was along z?
but no, because when the field was along z, mu·b would be gamma s_z b_z = gamma s_z b (since b was along z).
but now, if b is along y, then h = -gamma s_z b.
wait, but s_z is diagonal in the z-basis, so if the system was in an eigenstate of s_z, say |↑⟩, then under h = -gamma s_z b, the state would just pick up a phase.
but in this case, the hamiltonian is h = -gamma s_z b.
but if the initial state is |↑⟩, with s_z eigenvalue +ħ/2, then the energy is e = -gamma * (+ħ/2) * b.
so the state would evolve as |↑⟩ e^{-i e t / ħ} = |↑⟩ e^{i gamma b t /2 }.
so there's no oscillation in expectation value of s_z, because the state remains |↑⟩.
therefore, ⟨μ_z⟩ = gamma * (ħ/2) would be static.
but this contradicts the problem statement which says that the average z-component starts oscillating.
therefore, this suggests that my initial assumption is wrong: the problem states μ = gamma s_z, but when the field is turned off and the y field is turned on, the hamiltonian is not h = -mu·b = -gamma s_z b, but rather h = -mu·b = -gamma s_y b.
that is, perhaps mu is gamma s (vector), so when aligned along z, it's because the initial b was along z, but when b is along y, the hamiltonian is h = -gamma s_y b.
this would explain why the expectation value oscillates.
so maybe the problem has a typo in the definition of magnetic moment, or maybe they use a different convention.
alternatively, in the problem statement, "aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +z direction", so the magnetic moment is aligned along z, so the state is |↑⟩_z.
then, when the field is turned off and another one is turned on along +y.
so, in reality, when you switch off the z field and switch on the y field, the hamiltonian changes from h_initial = -mu*b_z to h_final = -mu*b_y.
if the magnetic moment is mu = gamma s_z, then h_initial = -gamma s_z b_z.
when you turn off b_z and turn on b_y, h_final = -gamma s_z b_y.
but s_z and b_y are along different axes.
so h_final is a non-diagonal matrix in the z-basis.
wait, let's see.
suppose s_z in matrix form is [[ ħ/2, 0 ], [ 0, -ħ/2 ]], and b_y is a c-number.
but how does s_z multiply with b_y?
if b_y is in the y direction, then the hamiltonian h = -mu·b = -gamma s_z b_y.
but s_z is along z, so the dot product is scalar.
so in this case, h = - gamma s_z b_y.
but s_z is a matrix, so h is a matrix proportional to s_z.
wait, but if b is along y, then the component of b along z is zero, so h = - gamma s_z * 0 = 0?
that can't be.
wait, no.
the magnetic field is b along y.
so the dot product mu·b is mu_x b_x + mu_y b_y + mu_z b_z.
if mu = gamma s_z (i.e., only mu_z component: gamma s_z, and mu_x = mu_y =0), then mu·b = gamma s_z * b_y * delta_{yz} = 0, since b is along y and mu is along z.
so mu·b = 0.
therefore, h = 0.
so there's no hamiltonian, so the system doesn't evolve.
therefore, expectation value remains constant.
but the problem says the average z-component starts oscillating.
this contradicts.
therefore, the problem must have intended that the magnetic moment is a vector mu = gamma s, and when the field is applied along y, the hamiltonian is h = -mu·b = -gamma s_y b.
therefore, even if the particle was aligned along z, once the field is switched to y, the hamiltonian is h = -gamma s_y b.
therefore, the system will start evolving under h proportional to s_y.
therefore, my original calculation holds, where the oscillation frequency is gamma b.
so answer a.
however, given the problem states mu = gamma s_z, not mu = gamma s, so perhaps the answer is different.
wait, perhaps the key here is that when the field is applied in the y direction, the torque causes the magnetization to precess around the y axis.
in classical terms, the angular frequency is gamma b.
however, in quantum mechanics, for a spin-1/2 particle, the precession manifests as rabi oscillations.
the rabi frequency is typically given by omega_r = gamma b, for a transverse field.
wait, but in the case where the field is perpendicular to the initial magnetization, the rabi frequency is gamma b.
so in this case, if the initial magnetization is along z and the field is applied along y, the oscillation frequency would be gamma b.
therefore, the answer is a.
but let's verify this via quantum mechanical calculation.
assume h = -mu·b.
if mu = gamma s_z, then h = -gamma s_z b_y.
but s_z is diagonal in the z-basis.
let's express h in that basis.
s_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]] (in units of ħ/2).
but h = -gamma b s_z (assuming b is along y? wait, b is a vector (0, b, 0).
so h = -mu·b = -gamma s_z * b_y.
so h = -gamma b s_z.
but s_z here is the z-component spin matrix.
so h is a diagonal matrix with entries (-gamma b (ħ/2), gamma b (ħ/2)).
therefore, the eigenstates of h are |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ with eigenvalues e_up = -gamma b (ħ/2) and e_down = gamma b (ħ/2).
so if the system starts in |↑⟩, it stays in |↑⟩, acquiring a phase.
but then ⟨s_z⟩ remains (ħ/2), so constant.
but this contradicts the problem statement.
therefore, the problem must have intended that the magnetic moment is a vector.
so mu = gamma s.
then, when the field is along y, h = -mu·
