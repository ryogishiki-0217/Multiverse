Okay, so I need to find the uncertainty ΔP_z for the given system.
The problem states that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ, and the explicit form of the state vector is given as (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2).
The uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula: ΔA = √⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩².
Here, A is the operator P_z, so ΔP_z = √⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩².
Since the system is in an eigenstate of P_x, but we need to find the uncertainty of P_z.
First, I need to check if the given state is an eigenstate of P_z.
If it is, then the uncertainty would be zero.
But looking at the matrix for P_z, its eigenvalues are ħ, 0, and -ħ.
The given state is ( -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ), which is a linear combination of the basis vectors.
Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, let me confirm that.
Let's think in parallel.

1: The matrix for the operator P_z is provided. Its diagonal elements are (ħ, 0, -ħ), and all off-diagonal elements are zero, indicating that P_z is a diagonal matrix. This structure implies that the standard basis vectors |1⟩ = (1, 0, 0), |2⟩ = (0, 1, 0), and |3⟩ = (0, 0, 1) are the eigenvectors of P_z, corresponding to the eigenvalues ħ, 0, and -ħ, respectively. The problem statement explicitly mentions that the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, confirming their identity. The given state vector is (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2), which is a linear combination of these basis vectors. Consequently, this state is not an eigenvector of P_z, as it is not proportional to any single basis vector, unless it represents a specific linear combination that is an eigenvector.

1.1: The state vector (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2) is examined to determine if it is an eigenvector of P_z. The vector has non-zero components in all three basis directions (a = -1/2, b = 1/√2, c = -1/2), indicating it is a combination of the three basis vectors |1⟩, |2⟩, and |3⟩. The eigenvalues of P_z for these basis vectors are ħ, 0, and -ħ, respectively. If the state were an eigenvector of P_z, it would be proportional to one of the basis vectors. Since it has non-zero components in all three directions, it is not an eigenvector of P_z. The possibility of it being a hidden eigenvector is considered, but given its explicit form, it is confirmed to be a linear combination of the three basis vectors, not an eigenvector itself.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The state vector (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2) is not an eigenvector of P_z, as it is a linear combination of the three basis eigenvectors, each with non-zero coefficients.

2: The eigenvalues of the operator P_x are determined by solving its characteristic equation. The matrix for P_x is provided as:
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & \hbar/\sqrt{2} & 0 \\
\hbar/\sqrt{2} & 0 & \hbar/\sqrt{2} \\
0 & \hbar/\sqrt{2} & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\]
The characteristic equation is found by calculating the determinant of (P_x - λI). The calculation of this determinant is as follows:
\[
\begin{vmatrix}
-\lambda & \hbar/\sqrt{2} & 0 \\
\hbar/\sqrt{2} & -\lambda & \hbar/\sqrt{2} \\
0 & \hbar/\sqrt{2} & -\lambda
\end{vmatrix}
\]
The determinant of this 3x3 matrix is expanded using the first row. The elements of the first row are -λ, ħ/√2, and 0. The minor matrix for the first element (-λ) is:
\[
\begin{vmatrix}
-\lambda & \hbar/\sqrt{2} \\
\hbar/\sqrt{2} & -\lambda
\end{vmatrix}
\]
The determinant of this minor matrix is λ² - (ħ²/2). The minor matrix for the second element (ħ/√2) is:
\[
\begin{vmatrix}
\hbar/\sqrt{2} & 0 \\
0 & -\lambda
\end{vmatrix}
\]
The determinant of this minor matrix is -(ħ/√2) * λ. The minor matrix for the third element (0) is:
\[
\begin{vmatrix}
\hbar/\sqrt{2} & -\lambda \\
0 & \hbar/\sqrt{2}
\end{vmatrix}
\]
The determinant of this minor matrix is (ħ/√2)². The overall determinant is calculated as:
(-λ) * (λ² - ħ²/2) - (ħ/√2) * ( - ħ/√2 * λ ) + 0.
This expression simplifies to:
-λ³ + (ħ²/2)λ + (ħ²/2)λ.
The final simplified determinant is:
-λ³ + ħ²λ.
The characteristic equation is -λ³ + ħ²λ = 0, which factors to -λ(λ² - ħ²) = 0.
The solutions to this equation are λ = 0, λ = ħ, and λ = -ħ.
The eigenvalues of P_x are therefore -ħ, 0, and ħ.
The problem states that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ.
The given state vector is (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2).
The eigenstates of P_x are the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues -ħ, 0, and ħ.
The eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue -ħ must be identified.
The eigenvector for the eigenvalue -ħ is determined by solving the equation (P_x + ħI)v = 0.
The matrix P_x + ħI is:
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
ħ & \hbar/\sqrt{2} & 0 \\
\hbar/\sqrt{2} & ħ & \hbar/\sqrt{2} \\
0 & \hbar/\sqrt{2} & ħ
\end{pmatrix}
\]
The equation (P_x + ħI)v = 0 is solved.
The first row of this matrix equation is ħv1 + (ħ/√2)v2 = 0.
The second row is (ħ/√2)v1 + ħv2 + (ħ/√2)v3 = 0.
The third row is (ħ/√2)v2 + ħv3 = 0.
These equations simplify to v1 + (1/√2)v2 = 0, (1/√2)v1 + v2 + (1/√2)v3 = 0, and (1/√2)v2 + v3 = 0.
The first equation gives v1 = -(1/√2)v2.
The third equation gives v3 = -(1/√2)v2.
Substituting v1 and v3 into the second equation yields (1/√2)(-1/√2 v2) + v2 + (1/√2)(-1/√2 v2) = 0.
This simplifies to (-1/2)v2 + v2 - 1/2v2 = 0, which further simplifies to 0 = 0.
The eigenvector is thus parameterized by v2.
Letting v2 = -√2, the components become v1 = 1, v3 = 1.
The eigenvector is (1, -√2, 1).
This eigenvector can be written as (1, -√2, 1).
The given state vector is (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2).
This vector is a scalar multiple of (1, -√2, 1).
The relationship is ( -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ) = (-1/2)(1, -√2, 1 ).
The factor is -1/2.
The eigenvector (1, -√2, 1 ) is confirmed to be an eigenvector of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ.
The given state vector is indeed an eigenvector of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ.
The state vector is properly normalized.
The normalization is confirmed.
The norm squared of the vector is (-1/2)² + (1/√2)² + (-1/2)².
This value is 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4, which sums to 1.
The state vector is normalized.

<Conclusion>
The P_z operator has eigenvalues ħ, 0, and -ħ, with corresponding eigenvectors (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1). The P_x operator has eigenvalues -ħ, 0, and ħ, with the given state vector (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2) identified as an eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue -ħ.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Therefore, the given state is an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ, as stated.
But we need to find the uncertainty in P_z for this state.
Since the state is not an eigenstate of P_z, the uncertainty will not be zero.

2: The expectation value ⟨P_z²⟩ for the given state.

1: The expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is calculated by taking the conjugate transpose of the state vector, multiplying it by the P_z matrix, and then multiplying the result by the state vector. The state vector is provided as a column vector with components (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The conjugate transpose of this state vector is the same as its transpose, given that all components are real. The P_z matrix is a diagonal matrix with elements (ħ, 0, -ħ). The calculation of ⟨P_z⟩ involves the expression (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2) multiplied by P_z and then by the column vector (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2)).
The calculation of the product (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2) * P_z involves multiplying each component of the state vector by the corresponding diagonal element of P_z.
The first term is (-1/2) multiplied by ħ.
The second term is (1/√2) multiplied by 0.
The third term is (-1/2) multiplied by (-ħ).
The sum of these terms is (-ħ/2) + 0 + (ħ/2).
The overall sum simplifies to 0.
The expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is 0.

2.1: The matrix P_z is diagonal with entries (ħ, 0, -ħ). The product P_z * P_z, being the square of a diagonal matrix, is computed by squaring each of its diagonal elements, resulting in the diagonal matrix with entries (ħ², 0, ħ²).
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The squared P_z matrix is diagonal with entries (ħ², 0, ħ²).
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
The expectation value ⟨P_z²⟩ is calculated by taking the dot product of the state vector with P_z² acting on the state vector.
The calculation of ⟨P_z²⟩ is performed using the components of the state vector and the P_z² matrix.
The state vector is (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2).
The P_z² matrix is diagonal with entries (ħ², 0, ħ²).
The first component of the state vector is -1/2, and the corresponding diagonal element of P_z² is ħ².
The second component of the state vector is 1/√2, and the corresponding diagonal element of P_z² is 0.
The third component of the state vector is -1/2, and the corresponding diagonal element of P_z² is ħ².
The expectation value is computed as (-1/2)² * ħ² + (1/√2)² * 0 + (-1/2)² * ħ².
This expression simplifies to (1/4)ħ² + 0 + (1/4)ħ².
The sum is (1/2)ħ².
The expectation value ⟨P_z²⟩ is ħ²/2.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ for the given state is 0, and the expectation value ⟨P_z²⟩ is ħ²/2.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Now, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²) = sqrt(ħ²/2 - 0²) = sqrt(ħ²/2) = ħ / sqrt(2).
Wait, so that would be option B.
But wait, let me confirm once again.
The state is given as (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2).
Let me check if this is correctly normalized.
The norm squared is (-1/2)² + (1/√2)² + (-1/2)² = 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1.
So it's normalized, which is good.
Calculating ⟨P_z⟩:
The P_z operator is diagonal with entries ħ, 0, -ħ.
So ⟨P_z⟩ is the sum of the components of the state vector multiplied by the corresponding P_z eigenvalues and then taking the complex conjugate.
But since the state is real, it's just (-1/2)*ħ + (1/√2)*0 + (-1/2)*(-ħ) = (-ħ/2) + 0 + (ħ/2) = 0.
That's correct.
Then ⟨P_z²⟩ is the sum of the components squared times the squares of the P_z eigenvalues.
Because P_z squared is a diagonal matrix with entries ħ², 0, ħ².
Therefore, ⟨P_z²⟩ = (-1/2)² * ħ² + (1/√2)² * 0 + (-1/2)² * ħ² = (1/4 ħ²) + 0 + (1/4 ħ²) = (1/2 ħ²).
Therefore, variance is ⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩² = (1/2 ħ²) - 0 = ħ²/2.
Therefore, standard deviation is sqrt(ħ²/2) = ħ / sqrt(2).
So the answer should be B.
Let me just check once more if I didn't make a mistake in the calculation.
Wait, the problem mentions that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ, and the state vector is given.
I need to make sure that the state vector is correctly given and that I didn't mix up any components.
The state vector is explicitly given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2).
So when I compute the expectation value, I take the bra vector, which is the conjugate transpose, so the same vector but row form.
Multiplying by P_z and then by the ket vector.
Since P_z is diagonal, the operation is straightforward.
Yes, each component is multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalue of P_z.
So first component: -1/2 * ħ, second: 1/√2 * 0, third: -1/2 * (-ħ) = ħ/2.
Then adding them up: -ħ/2 + 0 + ħ/2 = 0.
For the ⟨P_z²⟩, since P_z squared is diagonal with entries ħ², 0, ħ², so the components of the state vector get squared and multiplied by these values.
So (-1/2)² * ħ² + (1/√2)² * 0 + (-1/2)² * ħ² = (1/4 ħ²) + 0 + (1/4 ħ²) = 1/2 ħ².
Therefore, variance is 1/2 ħ², standard deviation is sqrt(1/2) ħ, which is ħ / sqrt(2).
So answer B.
Let's think in parallel.

<Path>
1: The uncertainty ΔP_z is calculated as the square root of the variance, resulting in √(ħ²/2), which simplifies to ħ/√2. This value corresponds to option B.

2: If the state were an eigenvector of P_z, the uncertainty ΔP_z would be zero. The given state vector (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2) is not an eigenvector of P_z. It is a linear combination of the P_z eigenvectors (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1). The given state is an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z, which results in non-zero uncertainty for P_z.
</Path>
<Path>
3: The problem specifies that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with the eigenvalue -ħ, and provides the state vector (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The eigenstates of P_x are the eigenvectors of the P_x matrix. The matrix for P_x is:
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & \hbar/\sqrt{2} & 0 \\
\hbar/\sqrt{2} & 0 & \hbar/\sqrt{2} \\
0 & \hbar/\sqrt{2} & 0

The eigenvalue equation P_x |v⟩ = -ħ |v⟩ is considered, where |v⟩ is the given state vector. The components of the state vector are v1 = -1/2, v2 = 1/√2, and v3 = -1/2.
The matrix-vector multiplication P_x |v⟩ is performed.
The first component of P_x |v⟩ is (0)*(-1/2) + (√2 ħ/2)*(1/√2) + 0*(-1/2) = 0 + (ħ/2) + 0 = ħ/2.
The second component of P_x |v⟩ is (√2 ħ/2)*(-1/2) + 0*(1/√2) + (√2 ħ/2)*(-1/2) = (-√2 ħ/4) + 0 + (-√2 ħ/4) = -√2 ħ/2.
The third component of P_x |v⟩ is 0*(-1/2) + (√2 ħ/2)*(1/√2) + 0*(-1/2) = 0 + (ħ/2) + 0 = ħ/2.
The result of the matrix-vector multiplication is P_x |v⟩ = (ħ/2, -√2 ħ/2, ħ/2).
The eigenvalue equation requires that P_x |v⟩ = -ħ |v⟩.
The right-hand side of this equation is -ħ * (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2) = (ħ/2, -ħ/√2, ħ/2).
The calculated P_x |v⟩ vector (ħ/2, -√2 ħ/2, ħ/2) is compared to the expected result (ħ/2, -ħ/√2, ħ/2).
The second component of the calculated P_x |v⟩ is -√2 ħ/2, which is equivalent to -ħ/√2.
The components of P_x |v⟩ and -ħ |v⟩ are confirmed to be identical.
The given state vector is indeed an eigenvector of P_x with the eigenvalue -ħ.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The uncertainty ΔP_z is calculated to be ħ/√2, corresponding to answer option B. If the state were an eigenvector of P_z, ΔP_z would be zero. The provided state vector is confirmed to be an eigenvector of P_x with the specified eigenvalue -ħ.
</Conclusion>

Therefore, all calculations are correct and the uncertainty is indeed ħ/√2, which is option B.
**Final Answer** 
\boxed{B}
</Think>

Answer: To find the uncertainty \(\Delta P_z\) of the operator \(P_z\) for the given state vector, we follow these steps:

1. **Identify the state vector**: The system is in the eigenstate of \(P_x\) corresponding to the eigenvalue \(-\hbar\), with the state vector \(\left( -\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, -\frac{1}{2} \right)\).

2. **Verify normalization**: The state vector is normalized since the sum of the squares of its components is \(\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = 1\).

3. **Calculate the expectation value \(\langle P_z \rangle\)**:
   - The matrix \(P_z\) is diagonal with entries \(\hbar, 0, -\hbar\).
   - The expectation value is computed as:
     \[
     \langle P_z \rangle = \left( -\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, -\frac{1}{2} \right) \begin{pmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{pmatrix}
     \]
   - This results in:
     \[
     \langle P_z \rangle = -\frac{1}{2} \cdot \hbar \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot 0 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + -\frac{1}{2} \cdot (-\hbar) \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) = -\frac{\hbar}{2} + 0 + \frac{\hbar}{2} = 0
     \]

4. **Calculate the expectation value \(\langle P_z^2 \rangle\)**:
   - The matrix \(P_z^2\) is diagonal with entries \(\hbar^2, 0, \hbar^2\).
   - The expectation value is computed as:
     \[
     \langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left( -\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, -\frac{1}{2} \right) \begin{pmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{pmatrix}
     \]
   - This results in:
     \[
     \langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left( \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 \right) + 0 + \left( \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 \right) = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}
     \]

5. **Calculate the uncertainty \(\Delta P_z\)**:
   - Using the formula \(\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}\):
     \[
     \Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0^2} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}
     \]

Thus, the uncertainty \(\Delta P_z\) is \(\boxed{B}\).

okay, so i need to find the uncertainty δp_z for the given system.
the problem states that the system is in an eigenstate of p_x with eigenvalue -ħ, and the explicit form of the state vector is given as (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2).
the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula: δa = √⟨a²⟩ - ⟨a⟩².
here, a is the operator p_z, so δp_z = √⟨p_z²⟩ - ⟨p_z⟩².
since the system is in an eigenstate of p_x, but we need to find the uncertainty of p_z.
first, i need to check if the given state is an eigenstate of p_z.
if it is, then the uncertainty would be zero.
but looking at the matrix for p_z, its eigenvalues are ħ, 0, and -ħ.
the given state is ( -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ), which is a linear combination of the basis vectors.

1: the matrix for the operator p_z is provided. its diagonal elements are (ħ, 0, -ħ), and all off-diagonal elements are zero, indicating that p_z is a diagonal matrix. this structure implies that the standard basis vectors |1⟩ = (1, 0, 0), |2⟩ = (0, 1, 0), and |3⟩ = (0, 0, 1) are the eigenvectors of p_z, corresponding to the eigenvalues ħ, 0, and -ħ, respectively. the problem statement explicitly mentions that the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of p_z, confirming their identity. the given state vector is (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2), which is a linear combination of these basis vectors. consequently, this state is not an eigenvector of p_z, as it is not proportional to any single basis vector, unless it represents a specific linear combination that is an eigenvector.

1.1: the state vector (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2) is examined to determine if it is an eigenvector of p_z. the vector has non-zero components in all three basis directions (a = -1/2, b = 1/√2, c = -1/2), indicating it is a combination of the three basis vectors |1⟩, |2⟩, and |3⟩. the eigenvalues of p_z for these basis vectors are ħ, 0, and -ħ, respectively. if the state were an eigenvector of p_z, it would be proportional to one of the basis vectors. since it has non-zero components in all three directions, it is not an eigenvector of p_z. the possibility of it being a hidden eigenvector is considered, but given its explicit form, it is confirmed to be a linear combination of the three basis vectors, not an eigenvector itself.

<conclusion>
the state vector (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2) is not an eigenvector of p_z, as it is a linear combination of the three basis eigenvectors, each with non-zero coefficients.

2: the eigenvalues of the operator p_x are determined by solving its characteristic equation. the matrix for p_x is provided as:
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & \hbar/\sqrt{2} & 0 \\
\hbar/\sqrt{2} & 0 & \hbar/\sqrt{2} \\
0 & \hbar/\sqrt{2} & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\]
the characteristic equation is found by calculating the determinant of (p_x - λi). the calculation of this determinant is as follows:
\[
\begin{vmatrix}
-\lambda & \hbar/\sqrt{2} & 0 \\
\hbar/\sqrt{2} & -\lambda & \hbar/\sqrt{2} \\
0 & \hbar/\sqrt{2} & -\lambda
\end{vmatrix}
\]
the determinant of this 3x3 matrix is expanded using the first row. the elements of the first row are -λ, ħ/√2, and 0. the minor matrix for the first element (-λ) is:
\[
\begin{vmatrix}
-\lambda & \hbar/\sqrt{2} \\
\hbar/\sqrt{2} & -\lambda
\end{vmatrix}
\]
the determinant of this minor matrix is λ² - (ħ²/2). the minor matrix for the second element (ħ/√2) is:
\[
\begin{vmatrix}
\hbar/\sqrt{2} & 0 \\
0 & -\lambda
\end{vmatrix}
\]
the determinant of this minor matrix is -(ħ/√2) * λ. the minor matrix for the third element (0) is:
\[
\begin{vmatrix}
\hbar/\sqrt{2} & -\lambda \\
0 & \hbar/\sqrt{2}
\end{vmatrix}
\]
the determinant of this minor matrix is (ħ/√2)². the overall determinant is calculated as:
(-λ) * (λ² - ħ²/2) - (ħ/√2) * ( - ħ/√2 * λ ) + 0.
this expression simplifies to:
-λ³ + (ħ²/2)λ + (ħ²/2)λ.
the final simplified determinant is:
-λ³ + ħ²λ.
the characteristic equation is -λ³ + ħ²λ = 0, which factors to -λ(λ² - ħ²) = 0.
the solutions to this equation are λ = 0, λ = ħ, and λ = -ħ.
the eigenvalues of p_x are therefore -ħ, 0, and ħ.
the problem states that the system is in an eigenstate of p_x with eigenvalue -ħ.
the given state vector is (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2).
the eigenstates of p_x are the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues -ħ, 0, and ħ.
the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue -ħ must be identified.
the eigenvector for the eigenvalue -ħ is determined by solving the equation (p_x + ħi)v = 0.
the matrix p_x + ħi is:
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
ħ & \hbar/\sqrt{2} & 0 \\
\hbar/\sqrt{2} & ħ & \hbar/\sqrt{2} \\
0 & \hbar/\sqrt{2} & ħ
\end{pmatrix}
\]
the equation (p_x + ħi)v = 0 is solved.
the first row of this matrix equation is ħv1 + (ħ/√2)v2 = 0.
the second row is (ħ/√2)v1 + ħv2 + (ħ/√2)v3 = 0.
the third row is (ħ/√2)v2 + ħv3 = 0.
these equations simplify to v1 + (1/√2)v2 = 0, (1/√2)v1 + v2 + (1/√2)v3 = 0, and (1/√2)v2 + v3 = 0.
the first equation gives v1 = -(1/√2)v2.
the third equation gives v3 = -(1/√2)v2.
substituting v1 and v3 into the second equation yields (1/√2)(-1/√2 v2) + v2 + (1/√2)(-1/√2 v2) = 0.
this simplifies to (-1/2)v2 + v2 - 1/2v2 = 0, which further simplifies to 0 = 0.
the eigenvector is thus parameterized by v2.
letting v2 = -√2, the components become v1 = 1, v3 = 1.
the eigenvector is (1, -√2, 1).
this eigenvector can be written as (1, -√2, 1).
the given state vector is (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2).
this vector is a scalar multiple of (1, -√2, 1).
the relationship is ( -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ) = (-1/2)(1, -√2, 1 ).
the factor is -1/2.
the eigenvector (1, -√2, 1 ) is confirmed to be an eigenvector of p_x with eigenvalue -ħ.
the given state vector is indeed an eigenvector of p_x with eigenvalue -ħ.
the state vector is properly normalized.
the normalization is confirmed.
the norm squared of the vector is (-1/2)² + (1/√2)² + (-1/2)².
this value is 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4, which sums to 1.
the state vector is normalized.

<conclusion>
the p_z operator has eigenvalues ħ, 0, and -ħ, with corresponding eigenvectors (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1). the p_x operator has eigenvalues -ħ, 0, and ħ, with the given state vector (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2) identified as an eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue -ħ.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
therefore, the given state is an eigenstate of p_x with eigenvalue -ħ, as stated.
but we need to find the uncertainty in p_z for this state.
since the state is not an eigenstate of p_z, the uncertainty will not be zero.
let's think in parallel.

</outline>
<outline>
2: the expectation value ⟨p_z²⟩ for the given state.
</outline>
</goal>
<path>
1: the expectation value ⟨p_z⟩ is calculated by taking the conjugate transpose of the state vector, multiplying it by the p_z matrix, and then multiplying the result by the state vector. the state vector is provided as a column vector with components (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). the conjugate transpose of this state vector is the same as its transpose, given that all components are real. the p_z matrix is a diagonal matrix with elements (ħ, 0, -ħ). the calculation of ⟨p_z⟩ involves the expression (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2) multiplied by p_z and then by the column vector (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2)).
the calculation of the product (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2) * p_z involves multiplying each component of the state vector by the corresponding diagonal element of p_z.
the first term is (-1/2) multiplied by ħ.
the second term is (1/√2) multiplied by 0.
the third term is (-1/2) multiplied by (-ħ).
the sum of these terms is (-ħ/2) + 0 + (ħ/2).
the overall sum simplifies to 0.
the expectation value ⟨p_z⟩ is 0.
</path>
<path>
2: the expectation value ⟨p_z²⟩ is determined. the matrix for p_z² is found by squaring the original p_z matrix. the squared matrix is diagonal with elements (ħ², 0, ħ²).
let's think in parallel.

2.1: the matrix p_z is diagonal with entries (ħ, 0, -ħ). the product p_z * p_z, being the square of a diagonal matrix, is computed by squaring each of its diagonal elements, resulting in the diagonal matrix with entries (ħ², 0, ħ²).
</path>
<conclusion>
the squared p_z matrix is diagonal with entries (ħ², 0, ħ²).
</conclusion>
</parallel>
the expectation value ⟨p_z²⟩ is calculated by taking the dot product of the state vector with p_z² acting on the state vector.
the calculation of ⟨p_z²⟩ is performed using the components of the state vector and the p_z² matrix.
the state vector is (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2).
the p_z² matrix is diagonal with entries (ħ², 0, ħ²).
the first component of the state vector is -1/2, and the corresponding diagonal element of p_z² is ħ².
the second component of the state vector is 1/√2, and the corresponding diagonal element of p_z² is 0.
the third component of the state vector is -1/2, and the corresponding diagonal element of p_z² is ħ².
the expectation value is computed as (-1/2)² * ħ² + (1/√2)² * 0 + (-1/2)² * ħ².
this expression simplifies to (1/4)ħ² + 0 + (1/4)ħ².
the sum is (1/2)ħ².
the expectation value ⟨p_z²⟩ is ħ²/2.
</path>
<conclusion>
the expectation value ⟨p_z⟩ for the given state is 0, and the expectation value ⟨p_z²⟩ is ħ²/2.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
now, the uncertainty δp_z is sqrt(⟨p_z²⟩ - ⟨p_z⟩²) = sqrt(ħ²/2 - 0²) = sqrt(ħ²/2) = ħ / sqrt(2).
wait, so that would be option b.
but wait, let me confirm once again.
the state is given as (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2).
let me check if this is correctly normalized.
the norm squared is (-1/2)² + (1/√2)² + (-1/2)² = 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1.
so it's normalized, which is good.
calculating ⟨p_z⟩:
the p_z operator is diagonal with entries ħ, 0, -ħ.
so ⟨p_z⟩ is the sum of the components of the state vector multiplied by the corresponding p_z eigenvalues and then taking the complex conjugate.
but since the state is real, it's just (-1/2)*ħ + (1/√2)*0 + (-1/2)*(-ħ) = (-ħ/2) + 0 + (ħ/2) = 0.
that's correct.
then ⟨p_z²⟩ is the sum of the components squared times the squares of the p_z eigenvalues.
because p_z squared is a diagonal matrix with entries ħ², 0, ħ².
therefore, ⟨p_z²⟩ = (-1/2)² * ħ² + (1/√2)² * 0 + (-1/2)² * ħ² = (1/4 ħ²) + 0 + (1/4 ħ²) = (1/2 ħ²).
therefore, variance is ⟨p_z²⟩ - ⟨p_z⟩² = (1/2 ħ²) - 0 = ħ²/2.
therefore, standard deviation is sqrt(ħ²/2) = ħ / sqrt(2).
so the answer should be b.
let me just check once more if i didn't make a mistake in the calculation.
wait, the problem mentions that the system is in an eigenstate of p_x with eigenvalue -ħ, and the state vector is given.
i need to make sure that the state vector is correctly given and that i didn't mix up any components.
the state vector is explicitly given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2).
so when i compute the expectation value, i take the bra vector, which is the conjugate transpose, so the same vector but row form.
multiplying by p_z and then by the ket vector.
since p_z is diagonal, the operation is straightforward.
yes, each component is multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalue of p_z.
so first component: -1/2 * ħ, second: 1/√2 * 0, third: -1/2 * (-ħ) = ħ/2.
then adding them up: -ħ/2 + 0 + ħ/2 = 0.
for the ⟨p_z²⟩, since p_z squared is diagonal with entries ħ², 0, ħ², so the components of the state vector get squared and multiplied by these values.
so (-1/2)² * ħ² + (1/√2)² * 0 + (-1/2)² * ħ² = (1/4 ħ²) + 0 + (1/4 ħ²) = 1/2 ħ².
therefore, variance is 1/2 ħ², standard deviation is sqrt(1/2) ħ, which is ħ / sqrt(2).
so answer b.

the eigenvalue equation p_x |v⟩ = -ħ |v⟩ is considered, where |v⟩ is the given state vector. the components of the state vector are v1 = -1/2, v2 = 1/√2, and v3 = -1/2.

the first component of p_x |v⟩ is (0)*(-1/2) + (√2 ħ/2)*(1/√2) + 0*(-1/2) = 0 + (ħ/2) + 0 = ħ/2.
the second component of p_x |v⟩ is (√2 ħ/2)*(-1/2) + 0*(1/√2) + (√2 ħ/2)*(-1/2) = (-√2 ħ/4) + 0 + (-√2 ħ/4) = -√2 ħ/2.
the third component of p_x |v⟩ is 0*(-1/2) + (√2 ħ/2)*(1/√2) + 0*(-1/2) = 0 + (ħ/2) + 0 = ħ/2.
the result of the matrix-vector multiplication is p_x |v⟩ = (ħ/2, -√2 ħ/2, ħ/2).
the eigenvalue equation requires that p_x |v⟩ = -ħ |v⟩.
the right-hand side of this equation is -ħ * (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2) = (ħ/2, -ħ/√2, ħ/2).
the calculated p_x |v⟩ vector (ħ/2, -√2 ħ/2, ħ/2) is compared to the expected result (ħ/2, -ħ/√2, ħ/2).
the second component of the calculated p_x |v⟩ is -√2 ħ/2, which is equivalent to -ħ/√2.
the components of p_x |v⟩ and -ħ |v⟩ are confirmed to be identical.
the given state vector is indeed an eigenvector of p_x with the eigenvalue -ħ.

<conclusion>
the uncertainty δp_z is calculated to be ħ/√2, corresponding to answer option b. if the state were an eigenvector of p_z, δp_z would be zero. the provided state vector is confirmed to be an eigenvector of p_x with the specified eigenvalue -ħ.

**final answer** 
\boxed{b}
</think>

answer: to find the uncertainty \(\delta p_z\) of the operator \(p_z\) for the given state vector, we follow these steps:

1. **identify the state vector**: the system is in the eigenstate of \(p_x\) corresponding to the eigenvalue \(-\hbar\), with the state vector \(\left( -\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, -\frac{1}{2} \right)\).

2. **verify normalization**: the state vector is normalized since the sum of the squares of its components is \(\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = 1\).

3. **calculate the expectation value \(\langle p_z \rangle\)**:
   - the matrix \(p_z\) is diagonal with entries \(\hbar, 0, -\hbar\).
   - the expectation value is computed as:
     \[
     \langle p_z \rangle = \left( -\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, -\frac{1}{2} \right) \begin{pmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{pmatrix}
     \]
   - this results in:
     \[
     \langle p_z \rangle = -\frac{1}{2} \cdot \hbar \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot 0 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + -\frac{1}{2} \cdot (-\hbar) \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) = -\frac{\hbar}{2} + 0 + \frac{\hbar}{2} = 0
     \]

4. **calculate the expectation value \(\langle p_z^2 \rangle\)**:
   - the matrix \(p_z^2\) is diagonal with entries \(\hbar^2, 0, \hbar^2\).
   - the expectation value is computed as:
     \[
     \langle p_z^2 \rangle = \left( -\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, -\frac{1}{2} \right) \begin{pmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{pmatrix}
     \]
   - this results in:
     \[
     \langle p_z^2 \rangle = \left( \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 \right) + 0 + \left( \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 \right) = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}
     \]

5. **calculate the uncertainty \(\delta p_z\)**:
   - using the formula \(\delta p_z = \sqrt{\langle p_z^2 \rangle - \langle p_z \rangle^2}\):
     \[
     \delta p_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0^2} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}
     \]

thus, the uncertainty \(\delta p_z\) is \(\boxed{b}\)
