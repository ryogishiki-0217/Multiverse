Okay, so I have this physics problem here related to particle decay in a CERN Bubble Chamber. The question is asking for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The given information includes the proper lifetime of the X0 particle (τ0 = 8 × 10^-16 s), the energy in the Bubble Chamber (27 GeV), and the mass of X0 (3.41 GeV). The answer choices are in meters, so the resolution must be a distance, probably related to how far the particle travels before decaying. Hmm, I need to figure out how to connect these pieces.
First, since the particle is moving at high energy, I should consider relativistic effects on its lifetime. The proper lifetime τ0 is the lifetime in the rest frame of the particle. But in the lab frame (the Bubble Chamber), the lifetime would be longer due to time dilation. The formula for the dilated lifetime is τ = γτ0, where γ is the Lorentz factor.
But wait, the problem mentions the energy of the particle in the Bubble Chamber. To find γ, I need to relate the energy to the mass. The total energy E of a relativistic particle is given by E = γmc2. So, solving for γ, we get γ = E/(mc2).
Wait, the units here are in GeV. The mass is 3.41 GeV, which is equivalent to mc2 = 3.41 GeV. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, which I think refers to the kinetic energy? Hmm, sometimes in particle physics, the total energy is given, but here it might be the kinetic energy. Wait, the problem says "the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV". Wait, does that mean the kinetic energy of the X0? Or the total energy? Need to be careful here.
Let me check the standard approach. In accelerators, when they talk about the energy of a particle, they often mean the kinetic energy. But sometimes, especially in collision experiments, they might refer to the total energy. Hmm. However, the mass of the X0 is given as 3.41 GeV, which is likely in units of GeV/c2, but often mass is quoted in GeV assuming c=1. So, if the particle's total energy is 27 GeV, then its gamma factor is E/m = 27 / 3.41. But if the kinetic energy is 27 GeV, then the total energy is mc2 + kinetic energy, which would be 3.41 + 27 = 30.41 GeV, so gamma would be 30.41 / 3.41 ≈ 9. I need to clarify which it is.
The problem states: "the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV". In particle physics, when a particle is moving in a bubble chamber, the energy is usually the total energy unless specified otherwise. But I need to confirm. Let me think: if X0 is produced with some kinetic energy, then in the bubble chamber, its total energy is higher than its rest mass energy. So, perhaps the given energy is the total energy. So, if the mass is 3.41 GeV, then E = 27 GeV (if that's the total energy) would imply gamma = E/m. But 27 GeV divided by 3.41 GeV is about 7.9, so gamma is roughly 7.9.
But wait, if the kinetic energy (K) is 27 GeV, then total energy E = K + mc2 = 27 + 3.41 = 30.41 GeV, so gamma = E/mc2 = 30.41 / 3.41 ≈ 9. So that's different. So which is it?
The problem says "the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV". Hmm. Without more context, this is ambiguous. But in the context of bubble chamber experiments, when they say the energy of a particle, they usually refer to its kinetic energy. Because the bubble chamber is used to track particles moving at high speeds, and the kinetic energy is a key parameter. Alternatively, maybe it's the total energy. Hmm.
But the problem gives the mass of X0 as 3.41 GeV, which is likely the rest mass energy (since mass in natural units is often given in GeV/c2, but often the c is absorbed, so it's just GeV). So if the total energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, that would include rest mass and kinetic. But 27 GeV is less than the total energy (which would have to be at least mc2 = 3.41 GeV). Wait, no, that can't be. If the total energy were 27 GeV, the kinetic energy would be 27 GeV - 3.41 GeV, which is negative. That can't be. Therefore, the energy mentioned must be the kinetic energy. So, the kinetic energy is 27 GeV, so the total energy is 27 GeV + 3.41 GeV = 30.41 GeV. Therefore, gamma is total energy divided by rest mass energy: γ = 30.41 / 3.41 ≈ 9.
Okay, so with that clarification, proceeding with E = kinetic energy = 27 GeV, so total energy is 30.41 GeV, gamma ≈ 9.
So then, the lifetime in the lab frame is τ = γτ0 ≈ 9 × 8 × 10^-16 s = 72 × 10^-16 s. Wait, but if γ is 30.41 / 3.41, let me calculate that more accurately. 3.41 × 9 = 30.69, which is a bit more than 30.41. So 30.41 / 3.41 ≈ 8.9. Let's calculate exactly: 3.41 × 8 = 27.28, and 3.41 × 0.9 = 3.069, so 3.41 × 8.9 = 27.28 + 3.069 = 30.349. That's very close to 30.41. So actually, 30.41 / 3.41 ≈ 8.9. So gamma ≈ 8.9.
Therefore, the lifetime in the lab frame τ ≈ 8.9 × 8 × 10^-16 s ≈ 71.2 × 10^-16 s.
But maybe I need to calculate this more accurately. Let's compute gamma exactly. Total energy E = kinetic energy + rest energy = 27 GeV + 3.41 GeV = 30.41 GeV. So gamma = E / (m c2) = 30.41 / 3.41 ≈ 30.41 / 3.41 ≈ Let's compute 30.41 ÷ 3.41.
Divide numerator and denominator by 3.41: 30.41 / 3.41 = (30.41 / 3.41) = 8.92 (since 3.41 × 8.92 ≈ 30.41. Let me check: 3.41 × 8 = 27.28, 3.41 × 0.92 = 3.1372, total 27.28 + 3.1372 = 30.4172 ≈ 30.41. So gamma ≈ 8.92. Therefore, the dilated lifetime τ = γ τ0 = 8.92 × 8 × 10^-16 s = 71.36 × 10^-16 s. Approximately 7.136 × 10^-15 seconds.
Okay, so in the lab frame, the lifetime is about 7.1 × 10^-15 seconds. So during this time, the particle travels a certain distance before decaying. The distance traveled is velocity × time. But since the particle is relativistic, we need to compute its velocity. For a relativistic particle, the velocity can be found using β = √(1 - 1/γ2). Alternatively, β = p c / E, where p is the momentum. But perhaps using γ = (1 / √(1 - β2)) as well. Let me recall that βγ = v / c2 * E / (m c2) = v / (c2) * E / (m c2). Wait, maybe it's easier to compute βγ first. Alternatively, since we have γ, and β = v/c, then for high-energy particles, γ can be approximated as E/(m c2), which we have as 8.92. So we can compute β using β = √(1 - 1/γ2). Let's compute that.
Given γ ≈ 8.92, 1/γ2 ≈ 1 / (8.92)^2 ≈ 1 / 79.56 ≈ 0.01257. Therefore, √(1 - 0.01257) ≈ √0.98743 ≈ 0.9937. So β ≈ 0.9937. Therefore, the velocity v ≈ βc ≈ 0.9937 * 3 × 10^8 m/s ≈ 2.981 × 10^8 m/s.
Alternatively, since we have total energy E and momentum p, related by E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c2)^2. So solving for pc: pc = √(E^2 - (m c2)^2). Let's do that.
E = 30.41 GeV, m c2 = 3.41 GeV. So (pc)^2 = (30.41)^2 - (3.41)^2 = 924.9681 - 11.6281 = 913.34. So pc = √913.34 ≈ 30.22 GeV. Therefore, momentum p = 30.22 GeV / c. So β = pc / E = 30.22 / 30.41 ≈ 0.9937. Which matches the previous result. So β ≈ 0.9937.
Therefore, velocity v = βc ≈ 0.9937 * 3e8 ≈ 2.981e8 m/s.
So now, the distance traveled by the particle in the lab frame before decaying is v × τ. So, distance Δx = v τ. Let's compute that.
τ ≈ 7.136e-15 s, v ≈ 2.981e8 m/s. Therefore, Δx ≈ 2.981e8 m/s * 7.136e-15 s ≈ Let me compute that. 2.981e8 * 7.136e-15 = 2.981 * 7.136 × 1e-7 m ≈ Let's compute 2.981 * 7.136. 3 * 7.136 = 21.408, subtract 0.019*7.136 ≈ 0.135. So approx. 21.408 - 0.135 ≈ 21.273. So 21.273 × 1e-7 m ≈ 2.1273 × 10^-6 m, or approximately 2.13 micrometers.
But the question is asking for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Wait, so the resolution must be such that the detector can resolve the decay vertex within the distance traveled by the particle. But since the particle's lifetime is a mean lifetime, the actual decay occurs at a random time between 0 and infinity, but with an exponential distribution. The problem is asking for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps they want the distance corresponding to the decay length such that 30% of the decays happen within that distance. Alternatively, maybe they need the full width at half maximum or something else. But in particle physics, the decay length is typically given by the mean lifetime times the velocity. So the average distance traveled is Δx = v τ. But if the question is about resolving the decay vertex, then the resolution should be smaller than the typical decay length. However, since the decays follow an exponential distribution, to observe 30% of the decays, maybe they need the distance within which 30% of the decays occur. The cumulative distribution function for exponential decay is F(t) = 1 - e^(-t/τ). So to find the time t such that 30% of decays have happened, we set 1 - e^(-t/τ) = 0.30, which gives e^(-t/τ) = 0.7, so -t/τ = ln(0.7), t = -τ ln(0.7). Then multiply by velocity to get the distance. Wait, maybe. Let me think.
If the problem is asking for the minimum resolution (i.e., the path length) such that 30% of the decays are observed, that probably corresponds to the distance where the integral of the decay probability from 0 to that distance is 30%. Since the decay is in flight, the probability is proportional to the proper lifetime and the path length. Wait, but in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer, so the decay rate in the lab frame is 1/τ. The decay probability as a function of time is exponential: P(t) = (1/τ) e^(-t/τ). The expected path length is then v multiplied by t. But if we need the resolution to be able to resolve the decay within a certain distance so that 30% of the decays are detected, perhaps they want the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of some distribution? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, if the detector has a resolution R, then the probability of detecting a decay is the ratio of R to the path length? That seems unlikely. Alternatively, the problem might require considering the time dilation and then computing the distance such that the integral of the decay probability up to that distance is 30%. Let's model it properly.
In the lab frame, the lifetime is τ = γ τ0. The decay distribution as a function of time is exponential: P(t) = (1/τ) e^(-t/τ). The distance traveled is v t. So to find the probability as a function of distance, we can substitute t = d/v. So the probability per unit distance is P(d) = (1/τ) e^(-d/(v τ)) * (1/v) = (1/(v τ)) e^(-d/(v τ)). So the cumulative distribution function (CDF) is F(d) = 1 - e^(-d/(v τ)). We need to find d such that F(d) = 0.30. Then, 1 - e^(-d/(v τ)) = 0.30 → e^(-d/(v τ)) = 0.70 → -d/(v τ) = ln(0.70) → d = -v τ ln(0.70). Calculating this:
First, compute v τ. We had τ ≈ 7.136e-15 s and v ≈ 2.981e8 m/s. So v τ ≈ 2.981e8 m/s * 7.136e-15 s ≈ 21.273e-7 m ≈ 2.1273e-6 m, which is about 2.1273 micrometers.
Then, multiply by -ln(0.70). ln(0.70) ≈ -0.3567. So take the absolute value times that. Wait, d = v τ * ln(1/0.7) = v τ * ln(10/7) ≈ 2.1273e-6 m * 0.3567 ≈ 0.758e-6 m ≈ 7.58e-7 m, which is 758 nanometers, or 0.758 micrometers.
But none of the answer choices are close to that. The answer choices are 2.08e-3 m (2.08 mm), 2.08e-1 m (20.8 cm), 2.08e-9 m (2.08 nm), and 2.08e-6 m (2.08 μm). Hmm. Wait, this suggests that the answer is around 0.758 micrometers, but the closest answer is 2.08e-6 m (2.08 μm), which is about three times larger. So why is there a discrepancy?
Wait, perhaps the question is simplified and doesn't consider the exponential decay, but instead uses the average lifetime? If they need the resolution to capture 30% of the decays, maybe they just take the average distance and scale it by some factor? For example, if 30% of the decays are within a certain multiple of the mean. However, in the exponential distribution, the mean is τ, but the median is τ ln(2), and the mean is the first moment. Alternatively, maybe the problem is not about the decay time distribution but simply the average distance divided by some number to get 30%? Wait, maybe the problem is actually about the resolution needed to resolve the decay vertex. If the particles travel a certain distance before decaying, the detector must have a resolution better than that distance to see the decay. But if they want to observe at least 30% of the decays, perhaps they need the distance where 30% of the particles have decayed, as I did before. But in that case, my calculation gives about 0.758 micrometers, but the answer choices don't have that. Alternatively, maybe the problem is about the uncertainty in the decay position? Or maybe I made a mistake in my steps.
Wait, let's check the steps again.
1. Calculate gamma: E_total = E_kinetic + m c^2 = 27 + 3.41 = 30.41 GeV. Then gamma = E_total / (m c^2) = 30.41 / 3.41 ≈ 8.92.
2. Dilated lifetime: τ = γ τ0 = 8.92 * 8e-16 ≈ 7.136e-15 s.
3. Velocity: computed via β = √(1 - 1/γ2) ≈ √(1 - 1/(8.92)^2) ≈ √(1 - 1/79.56) ≈ √0.987 ≈ 0.9935c. The velocity is then 0.9935 * 3e8 ≈ 2.98e8 m/s.
4. Compute the distance d = v τ ≈ 2.98e8 m/s * 7.136e-15 s ≈ 2.12e-6 m, which is about 2.12 micrometers.
5. Then, to find the distance where 30% of the decays occur, set 1 - e^(-d/(v τ)) = 0.30. Wait, no, that would be 1 - e^(-x) = 0.3, so e^(-x) = 0.7, x = -ln(0.7) ≈ 0.3567. So d = 0.3567 * v τ ≈ 0.3567 * 2.12e-6 m ≈ 0.756e-6 m, which is 756 nanometers, or 7.56e-7 m. But none of the answer choices are in that range. The answer choices are 2.08e-3 m (2.08 mm), 2.08e-1 m (20.8 cm), 2.08e-9 m (2.08 nm), 2.08e-6 m (2.08 μm). The 2.08e-6 m is 2.08 micrometers, which is close to my calculated v τ of ~2.12 micrometers. So perhaps they took gamma as exactly E_total / m c^2 = 30.41 / 3.41 ≈ 8.9, then τ = 8.9 * 8e-16 = 7.12e-15 s, then v ≈ pc / E. Let me check that.
Alternatively, maybe they used the approximate relation for high gamma, where γ ≈ E/(m c2). Then, since E = 27 GeV, and m c2 = 3.41 GeV, gamma ≈ 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.92. Wait, but that would be if the total energy is 27 GeV, which would be inconsistent because the rest mass is 3.41 GeV, so kinetic energy would have to be 27 GeV, hence total energy 30.41 GeV, which gives gamma ≈ 30.41 / 3.41 ≈ 8.92. So if the total energy is 27 GeV, then that would imply gamma ≈ 7.92, but that is not correct because total energy includes rest mass.
Wait, the problem says "the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27GeV". If that's the total energy, then gamma = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.92, but then the lifetime dilation would be τ = 7.92 * 8e-16 ≈ 6.34e-15 s. Then, velocity: for gamma =7.92, beta = sqrt(1 -1/(7.92)^2)=sqrt(1 -1/62.7)=sqrt(0.984)=0.992. So velocity v=0.992c≈2.976e8 m/s. Then distance v τ ≈ 2.976e8 *6.34e-15≈1.888e-6 m≈1.888 micrometers. Then, the 30% distance would be 1.888 * ln(10/7) ≈1.888*0.3567≈0.67 micrometers. Still not matching the answer choices.
Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the proper lifetime, not the lab lifetime. If not considering relativistic effects, the lifetime is 8e-16 s, and then distance would be v * tau_0. But even then, with velocity ~3e8 m/s, 3e8 *8e-16=2.4e-7 m=240 nanometers. Then 30% distance would be even less. But the answer choices are 2.08e-6 m (microns), which is 2.08 micrometers. Hmm.
Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's see the answer options all have 2.08, just different exponents. The answer is one of them. Let me check my calculation again. If I use exact numbers:
Gamma is 30.41 / 3.41 = 30.41 / 3.41 ≈ 8.917. So gamma =8.917. Lifetime tau =8.917*8e-16=7.1336e-15 s. Velocity: beta= sqrt(1 -1/gamma2)=sqrt(1 -1/(8.917)^2)=sqrt(1 -0.01256)=sqrt(0.98744)=0.9937. So velocity=0.9937c=0.9937*3e8≈2.981e8 m/s. Then distance delta x= v tau=2.981e8 *7.1336e-15≈2.114e-6 m≈2.114 micrometers. So that's the average distance. Then the question is about the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays. If the resolution is on the order of the decay length, then 30% would be detected. But the answer choice C is 2.08e-9 m, which is 2.08 nanometers, answer D is 2.08e-6 m, which is micrometers. The calculated value is approximately 2.1e-6 m, which is answer D. If the answer is D, then perhaps they just approximated 3.41 as 3.4, 8 as 8, etc., leading to gamma=30.41/3.4≈9, tau=9*8=72e-16, velocity≈0.99c, then 0.99c*72e-16=0.99*3e8*72e-16=2.13e-6 m≈2.1e-6 m, so 2.08e-6 m is close. So maybe they used some approximations. So then the answer is D. But the question says "minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays". If the resolution is 2.08e-6 m (2.08 micrometers), which is similar to the average decay length, then the number of observed decays would be around 1 - e^(-2.08/2.12) ≈1 - e^(-0.98)≈1 - 0.376≈0.624, so 62% of decays would be observed. But the question says "at least 30%", so even a lower resolution would suffice. Wait, but the problem says "minimum resolution" to observe at least 30%. So the minimum resolution would be the resolution that allows exactly 30% of decays to be observed, which would be the distance d where 30% of decays happen, which is less than the average distance. Wait, but if the average is ~2.1 micrometers, then 30% would be at a shorter distance. As calculated before, d = -v τ ln(0.7) ≈2.12e-6 m * 0.3567 ≈0.756e-6 m≈756 nanometers, which is around 0.75e-6 m. But none of the answer options match. The closest is 2.08e-6 m, which is answer D. But that's three times larger. Alternatively, maybe the question is not about the distance where 30% decay, but the resolution needed to resolve the decay at the average distance. Since the average decay length is ~2.1e-6 m, and the answer D is 2.08e-6 m, which is close. So perhaps the answer is D, assuming that the minimum resolution is on the order of the decay length. But I'm confused here. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating gamma. Let me check. If the energy is 27 GeV, and the mass is 3.41 GeV, then the total energy is kinetic + rest mass. So if kinetic energy is 27 GeV, rest mass is 3.41 GeV, total energy is 30.41 GeV. Then gamma =30.41 /3.41≈8.917. So velocity: beta c = sqrt(1 -1/gamma2)=sqrt(1 -1/8.917^2)=sqrt(1 -1/79.5)=sqrt(0.987)=0.9935c. So velocity=0.9935*3e8≈2.98e8 m/s. Then lifetime in lab frame tau=gamma tau0=8.917*8e-16≈7.13e-15 s. Distance v*tau=2.98e8*7.13e-15≈2.11e-6 m≈2.11 micrometers. So the average decay length is about 2.1 micrometers. So if the resolution is 2.08e-6 m (option D), which is ~2.08 micrometers, that's close to the average. But how does this relate to observing 30% of the decays? If the resolution is the same order as the average decay length, then the chance of observing the decay would be significant. Wait, perhaps the "resolution" refers to the time resolution, but the answer is given in meters. Alternatively, maybe it's the spatial resolution, i.e., the precision in measuring the decay vertex position. If the decay length is 2.1 micrometers, then to resolve the decay (i.e., see it as a distinct vertex), the resolution must be smaller than that. However, the problem says "minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays". This phrasing is a bit unclear. If 30% of the decays are to be observed, maybe the resolution must be such that it can detect decays within a certain distance. But since the decays are spread out over an exponential distribution, perhaps the 30% corresponds to the containment within the resolution. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the Doppler effect in the decay, which enhances the lifetime in a particular direction, but I don't think so. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simplified and just divides the average distance by some factor. Wait, let's think of another approach. Suppose the problem is simplified and doesn't consider relativistic addition of velocities or time dilation. Let's see. If the proper lifetime is 8e-16 s, and the particle moves at velocity v. Then in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau_0. The distance traveled is v gamma tau_0. If gamma is not considered, then it's just v tau_0. But the given answer options differ. But if the problem ignores gamma, then: velocity is found using classical kinetic energy: KE = (1/2) m v2. But with mass 3.41 GeV/c2, kinetic energy 27 GeV? That's a problem, since classical mechanics would never handle such energies. But for the sake of calculation, if we ignore relativity: KE = 1/2 m v2 =27 GeV. m =3.41 GeV/c2. But 1 GeV =1.6e-10 J. So KE in Joules:27 GeV *1.6e-10 J/GeV=4.32e-9 J. Mass in kg:3.41 GeV/c2 *1.78e-27 kg/GeV=3.41*1.78e-27≈6.07e-27 kg. Then v^2=2*KE/m=2*4.32e-9 J /6.07e-27 kg≈1.426e19 m2/s2, so v≈3.77e9 m/s, which is impossible, since it's higher than the speed of light. Thus, classical mechanics is invalid here, so we must use relativistic mechanics. Therefore, the initial approach with relativistic lifetime dilation and velocity is correct. Given that the average distance is ~2.1 micrometers, and answer D is 2.08e-6 m, which is 2.08 micrometers. If the problem is asking for the average distance traveled, then answer D is close. But why 2.08 instead of 2.12? Maybe due to rounding during calculations. Let's check with precise numbers. Given gamma=30.41 /3.41=exactly 30.41/3.41. Let me calculate that: 3.41 × 9 = 30.69. But we have 30.41, so 30.41 /3.41 =9 - (0.28)/3.41≈9 -0.082≈8.918. So gamma≈8.918. Then tau=8.918×8e-16=7.1344e-16 s. Velocity: beta= sqrt(1 -1/(8.918)^2)=sqrt(1 -1/79.5)=sqrt(0.9874)=0.9937c. Therefore, velocity=0.9937×299792458≈0.9937×299792458≈2.981e8 m/s. Then, distance=2.981e8 m/s ×7.1344e-16 s=2.115e-7 meters? Wait, 2.981e8 *7.1344e-16= (2.981*7.1344) *1e-8≈21.27*1e-8=2.127e-7 meters=2.127e-7 m=21.27 micrometers? Wait, no, 1e-6 m is 1 micrometer, so 2.127e-7 m is 0.2127 micrometers. Wait, that can't be. Wait, 2.981e8 m/s *7.1344e-16 s=2.127e-7 m=0.2127e-6 m=0.2127 micrometers. Wait, no—2.127e-7 m is 2.127 ×10^-7 m=0.2127 ×10^-6 m=0.2127 micrometers. But this contradicts the previous calculation which suggested ~2.1 micrometers. Wait, no. Wait, 2.981e8 meters per second times 7.1344e-16 seconds is: 2.981e8 *7.1344e-16 = (2.981 *7.1344) ×1e-8 m. 2.981*7.1344≈21. What's 2.981*7? 20.867. 2.981*0.1344≈0.401. Total≈20.867+0.401≈21.268. So 21.268 ×1e-8 m=2.1268e-7 m=0.21268e-6 m=0

okay, so i have this physics problem here related to particle decay in a cern bubble chamber. the question is asking for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. the given information includes the proper lifetime of the x0 particle (τ0 = 8 × 10^-16 s), the energy in the bubble chamber (27 gev), and the mass of x0 (3.41 gev). the answer choices are in meters, so the resolution must be a distance, probably related to how far the particle travels before decaying. hmm, i need to figure out how to connect these pieces.
first, since the particle is moving at high energy, i should consider relativistic effects on its lifetime. the proper lifetime τ0 is the lifetime in the rest frame of the particle. but in the lab frame (the bubble chamber), the lifetime would be longer due to time dilation. the formula for the dilated lifetime is τ = γτ0, where γ is the lorentz factor.
but wait, the problem mentions the energy of the particle in the bubble chamber. to find γ, i need to relate the energy to the mass. the total energy e of a relativistic particle is given by e = γmc2. so, solving for γ, we get γ = e/(mc2).
wait, the units here are in gev. the mass is 3.41 gev, which is equivalent to mc2 = 3.41 gev. the energy in the bubble chamber is 27 gev, which i think refers to the kinetic energy? hmm, sometimes in particle physics, the total energy is given, but here it might be the kinetic energy. wait, the problem says "the energy in the bubble chamber is 27 gev". wait, does that mean the kinetic energy of the x0? or the total energy? need to be careful here.
let me check the standard approach. in accelerators, when they talk about the energy of a particle, they often mean the kinetic energy. but sometimes, especially in collision experiments, they might refer to the total energy. hmm. however, the mass of the x0 is given as 3.41 gev, which is likely in units of gev/c2, but often mass is quoted in gev assuming c=1. so, if the particle's total energy is 27 gev, then its gamma factor is e/m = 27 / 3.41. but if the kinetic energy is 27 gev, then the total energy is mc2 + kinetic energy, which would be 3.41 + 27 = 30.41 gev, so gamma would be 30.41 / 3.41 ≈ 9. i need to clarify which it is.
the problem states: "the energy in the bubble chamber is 27gev". in particle physics, when a particle is moving in a bubble chamber, the energy is usually the total energy unless specified otherwise. but i need to confirm. let me think: if x0 is produced with some kinetic energy, then in the bubble chamber, its total energy is higher than its rest mass energy. so, perhaps the given energy is the total energy. so, if the mass is 3.41 gev, then e = 27 gev (if that's the total energy) would imply gamma = e/m. but 27 gev divided by 3.41 gev is about 7.9, so gamma is roughly 7.9.
but wait, if the kinetic energy (k) is 27 gev, then total energy e = k + mc2 = 27 + 3.41 = 30.41 gev, so gamma = e/mc2 = 30.41 / 3.41 ≈ 9. so that's different. so which is it?
the problem says "the energy in the bubble chamber is 27gev". hmm. without more context, this is ambiguous. but in the context of bubble chamber experiments, when they say the energy of a particle, they usually refer to its kinetic energy. because the bubble chamber is used to track particles moving at high speeds, and the kinetic energy is a key parameter. alternatively, maybe it's the total energy. hmm.
but the problem gives the mass of x0 as 3.41 gev, which is likely the rest mass energy (since mass in natural units is often given in gev/c2, but often the c is absorbed, so it's just gev). so if the total energy in the bubble chamber is 27 gev, that would include rest mass and kinetic. but 27 gev is less than the total energy (which would have to be at least mc2 = 3.41 gev). wait, no, that can't be. if the total energy were 27 gev, the kinetic energy would be 27 gev - 3.41 gev, which is negative. that can't be. therefore, the energy mentioned must be the kinetic energy. so, the kinetic energy is 27 gev, so the total energy is 27 gev + 3.41 gev = 30.41 gev. therefore, gamma is total energy divided by rest mass energy: γ = 30.41 / 3.41 ≈ 9.
okay, so with that clarification, proceeding with e = kinetic energy = 27 gev, so total energy is 30.41 gev, gamma ≈ 9.
so then, the lifetime in the lab frame is τ = γτ0 ≈ 9 × 8 × 10^-16 s = 72 × 10^-16 s. wait, but if γ is 30.41 / 3.41, let me calculate that more accurately. 3.41 × 9 = 30.69, which is a bit more than 30.41. so 30.41 / 3.41 ≈ 8.9. let's calculate exactly: 3.41 × 8 = 27.28, and 3.41 × 0.9 = 3.069, so 3.41 × 8.9 = 27.28 + 3.069 = 30.349. that's very close to 30.41. so actually, 30.41 / 3.41 ≈ 8.9. so gamma ≈ 8.9.
therefore, the lifetime in the lab frame τ ≈ 8.9 × 8 × 10^-16 s ≈ 71.2 × 10^-16 s.
but maybe i need to calculate this more accurately. let's compute gamma exactly. total energy e = kinetic energy + rest energy = 27 gev + 3.41 gev = 30.41 gev. so gamma = e / (m c2) = 30.41 / 3.41 ≈ 30.41 / 3.41 ≈ let's compute 30.41 ÷ 3.41.
divide numerator and denominator by 3.41: 30.41 / 3.41 = (30.41 / 3.41) = 8.92 (since 3.41 × 8.92 ≈ 30.41. let me check: 3.41 × 8 = 27.28, 3.41 × 0.92 = 3.1372, total 27.28 + 3.1372 = 30.4172 ≈ 30.41. so gamma ≈ 8.92. therefore, the dilated lifetime τ = γ τ0 = 8.92 × 8 × 10^-16 s = 71.36 × 10^-16 s. approximately 7.136 × 10^-15 seconds.
okay, so in the lab frame, the lifetime is about 7.1 × 10^-15 seconds. so during this time, the particle travels a certain distance before decaying. the distance traveled is velocity × time. but since the particle is relativistic, we need to compute its velocity. for a relativistic particle, the velocity can be found using β = √(1 - 1/γ2). alternatively, β = p c / e, where p is the momentum. but perhaps using γ = (1 / √(1 - β2)) as well. let me recall that βγ = v / c2 * e / (m c2) = v / (c2) * e / (m c2). wait, maybe it's easier to compute βγ first. alternatively, since we have γ, and β = v/c, then for high-energy particles, γ can be approximated as e/(m c2), which we have as 8.92. so we can compute β using β = √(1 - 1/γ2). let's compute that.
given γ ≈ 8.92, 1/γ2 ≈ 1 / (8.92)^2 ≈ 1 / 79.56 ≈ 0.01257. therefore, √(1 - 0.01257) ≈ √0.98743 ≈ 0.9937. so β ≈ 0.9937. therefore, the velocity v ≈ βc ≈ 0.9937 * 3 × 10^8 m/s ≈ 2.981 × 10^8 m/s.
alternatively, since we have total energy e and momentum p, related by e^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c2)^2. so solving for pc: pc = √(e^2 - (m c2)^2). let's do that.
e = 30.41 gev, m c2 = 3.41 gev. so (pc)^2 = (30.41)^2 - (3.41)^2 = 924.9681 - 11.6281 = 913.34. so pc = √913.34 ≈ 30.22 gev. therefore, momentum p = 30.22 gev / c. so β = pc / e = 30.22 / 30.41 ≈ 0.9937. which matches the previous result. so β ≈ 0.9937.
therefore, velocity v = βc ≈ 0.9937 * 3e8 ≈ 2.981e8 m/s.
so now, the distance traveled by the particle in the lab frame before decaying is v × τ. so, distance δx = v τ. let's compute that.
τ ≈ 7.136e-15 s, v ≈ 2.981e8 m/s. therefore, δx ≈ 2.981e8 m/s * 7.136e-15 s ≈ let me compute that. 2.981e8 * 7.136e-15 = 2.981 * 7.136 × 1e-7 m ≈ let's compute 2.981 * 7.136. 3 * 7.136 = 21.408, subtract 0.019*7.136 ≈ 0.135. so approx. 21.408 - 0.135 ≈ 21.273. so 21.273 × 1e-7 m ≈ 2.1273 × 10^-6 m, or approximately 2.13 micrometers.
but the question is asking for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. wait, so the resolution must be such that the detector can resolve the decay vertex within the distance traveled by the particle. but since the particle's lifetime is a mean lifetime, the actual decay occurs at a random time between 0 and infinity, but with an exponential distribution. the problem is asking for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. so perhaps they want the distance corresponding to the decay length such that 30% of the decays happen within that distance. alternatively, maybe they need the full width at half maximum or something else. but in particle physics, the decay length is typically given by the mean lifetime times the velocity. so the average distance traveled is δx = v τ. but if the question is about resolving the decay vertex, then the resolution should be smaller than the typical decay length. however, since the decays follow an exponential distribution, to observe 30% of the decays, maybe they need the distance within which 30% of the decays occur. the cumulative distribution function for exponential decay is f(t) = 1 - e^(-t/τ). so to find the time t such that 30% of decays have happened, we set 1 - e^(-t/τ) = 0.30, which gives e^(-t/τ) = 0.7, so -t/τ = ln(0.7), t = -τ ln(0.7). then multiply by velocity to get the distance. wait, maybe. let me think.
if the problem is asking for the minimum resolution (i.e., the path length) such that 30% of the decays are observed, that probably corresponds to the distance where the integral of the decay probability from 0 to that distance is 30%. since the decay is in flight, the probability is proportional to the proper lifetime and the path length. wait, but in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer, so the decay rate in the lab frame is 1/τ. the decay probability as a function of time is exponential: p(t) = (1/τ) e^(-t/τ). the expected path length is then v multiplied by t. but if we need the resolution to be able to resolve the decay within a certain distance so that 30% of the decays are detected, perhaps they want the full width at half maximum (fwhm) of some distribution? hmm, maybe not. alternatively, if the detector has a resolution r, then the probability of detecting a decay is the ratio of r to the path length? that seems unlikely. alternatively, the problem might require considering the time dilation and then computing the distance such that the integral of the decay probability up to that distance is 30%. let's model it properly.
in the lab frame, the lifetime is τ = γ τ0. the decay distribution as a function of time is exponential: p(t) = (1/τ) e^(-t/τ). the distance traveled is v t. so to find the probability as a function of distance, we can substitute t = d/v. so the probability per unit distance is p(d) = (1/τ) e^(-d/(v τ)) * (1/v) = (1/(v τ)) e^(-d/(v τ)). so the cumulative distribution function (cdf) is f(d) = 1 - e^(-d/(v τ)). we need to find d such that f(d) = 0.30. then, 1 - e^(-d/(v τ)) = 0.30 → e^(-d/(v τ)) = 0.70 → -d/(v τ) = ln(0.70) → d = -v τ ln(0.70). calculating this:
first, compute v τ. we had τ ≈ 7.136e-15 s and v ≈ 2.981e8 m/s. so v τ ≈ 2.981e8 m/s * 7.136e-15 s ≈ 21.273e-7 m ≈ 2.1273e-6 m, which is about 2.1273 micrometers.
then, multiply by -ln(0.70). ln(0.70) ≈ -0.3567. so take the absolute value times that. wait, d = v τ * ln(1/0.7) = v τ * ln(10/7) ≈ 2.1273e-6 m * 0.3567 ≈ 0.758e-6 m ≈ 7.58e-7 m, which is 758 nanometers, or 0.758 micrometers.
but none of the answer choices are close to that. the answer choices are 2.08e-3 m (2.08 mm), 2.08e-1 m (20.8 cm), 2.08e-9 m (2.08 nm), and 2.08e-6 m (2.08 μm). hmm. wait, this suggests that the answer is around 0.758 micrometers, but the closest answer is 2.08e-6 m (2.08 μm), which is about three times larger. so why is there a discrepancy?
wait, perhaps the question is simplified and doesn't consider the exponential decay, but instead uses the average lifetime? if they need the resolution to capture 30% of the decays, maybe they just take the average distance and scale it by some factor? for example, if 30% of the decays are within a certain multiple of the mean. however, in the exponential distribution, the mean is τ, but the median is τ ln(2), and the mean is the first moment. alternatively, maybe the problem is not about the decay time distribution but simply the average distance divided by some number to get 30%? wait, maybe the problem is actually about the resolution needed to resolve the decay vertex. if the particles travel a certain distance before decaying, the detector must have a resolution better than that distance to see the decay. but if they want to observe at least 30% of the decays, perhaps they need the distance where 30% of the particles have decayed, as i did before. but in that case, my calculation gives about 0.758 micrometers, but the answer choices don't have that. alternatively, maybe the problem is about the uncertainty in the decay position? or maybe i made a mistake in my steps.
wait, let's check the steps again.
1. calculate gamma: e_total = e_kinetic + m c^2 = 27 + 3.41 = 30.41 gev. then gamma = e_total / (m c^2) = 30.41 / 3.41 ≈ 8.92.
2. dilated lifetime: τ = γ τ0 = 8.92 * 8e-16 ≈ 7.136e-15 s.
3. velocity: computed via β = √(1 - 1/γ2) ≈ √(1 - 1/(8.92)^2) ≈ √(1 - 1/79.56) ≈ √0.987 ≈ 0.9935c. the velocity is then 0.9935 * 3e8 ≈ 2.98e8 m/s.
4. compute the distance d = v τ ≈ 2.98e8 m/s * 7.136e-15 s ≈ 2.12e-6 m, which is about 2.12 micrometers.
5. then, to find the distance where 30% of the decays occur, set 1 - e^(-d/(v τ)) = 0.30. wait, no, that would be 1 - e^(-x) = 0.3, so e^(-x) = 0.7, x = -ln(0.7) ≈ 0.3567. so d = 0.3567 * v τ ≈ 0.3567 * 2.12e-6 m ≈ 0.756e-6 m, which is 756 nanometers, or 7.56e-7 m. but none of the answer choices are in that range. the answer choices are 2.08e-3 m (2.08 mm), 2.08e-1 m (20.8 cm), 2.08e-9 m (2.08 nm), 2.08e-6 m (2.08 μm). the 2.08e-6 m is 2.08 micrometers, which is close to my calculated v τ of ~2.12 micrometers. so perhaps they took gamma as exactly e_total / m c^2 = 30.41 / 3.41 ≈ 8.9, then τ = 8.9 * 8e-16 = 7.12e-15 s, then v ≈ pc / e. let me check that.
alternatively, maybe they used the approximate relation for high gamma, where γ ≈ e/(m c2). then, since e = 27 gev, and m c2 = 3.41 gev, gamma ≈ 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.92. wait, but that would be if the total energy is 27 gev, which would be inconsistent because the rest mass is 3.41 gev, so kinetic energy would have to be 27 gev, hence total energy 30.41 gev, which gives gamma ≈ 30.41 / 3.41 ≈ 8.92. so if the total energy is 27 gev, then that would imply gamma ≈ 7.92, but that is not correct because total energy includes rest mass.
wait, the problem says "the energy in the bubble chamber is 27gev". if that's the total energy, then gamma = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.92, but then the lifetime dilation would be τ = 7.92 * 8e-16 ≈ 6.34e-15 s. then, velocity: for gamma =7.92, beta = sqrt(1 -1/(7.92)^2)=sqrt(1 -1/62.7)=sqrt(0.984)=0.992. so velocity v=0.992c≈2.976e8 m/s. then distance v τ ≈ 2.976e8 *6.34e-15≈1.888e-6 m≈1.888 micrometers. then, the 30% distance would be 1.888 * ln(10/7) ≈1.888*0.3567≈0.67 micrometers. still not matching the answer choices.
alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the proper lifetime, not the lab lifetime. if not considering relativistic effects, the lifetime is 8e-16 s, and then distance would be v * tau_0. but even then, with velocity ~3e8 m/s, 3e8 *8e-16=2.4e-7 m=240 nanometers. then 30% distance would be even less. but the answer choices are 2.08e-6 m (microns), which is 2.08 micrometers. hmm.
wait, maybe i'm overcomplicating. let's see the answer options all have 2.08, just different exponents. the answer is one of them. let me check my calculation again. if i use exact numbers:
gamma is 30.41 / 3.41 = 30.41 / 3.41 ≈ 8.917. so gamma =8.917. lifetime tau =8.917*8e-16=7.1336e-15 s. velocity: beta= sqrt(1 -1/gamma2)=sqrt(1 -1/(8.917)^2)=sqrt(1 -0.01256)=sqrt(0.98744)=0.9937. so velocity=0.9937c=0.9937*3e8≈2.981e8 m/s. then distance delta x= v tau=2.981e8 *7.1336e-15≈2.114e-6 m≈2.114 micrometers. so that's the average distance. then the question is about the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays. if the resolution is on the order of the decay length, then 30% would be detected. but the answer choice c is 2.08e-9 m, which is 2.08 nanometers, answer d is 2.08e-6 m, which is micrometers. the calculated value is approximately 2.1e-6 m, which is answer d. if the answer is d, then perhaps they just approximated 3.41 as 3.4, 8 as 8, etc., leading to gamma=30.41/3.4≈9, tau=9*8=72e-16, velocity≈0.99c, then 0.99c*72e-16=0.99*3e8*72e-16=2.13e-6 m≈2.1e-6 m, so 2.08e-6 m is close. so maybe they used some approximations. so then the answer is d. but the question says "minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays". if the resolution is 2.08e-6 m (2.08 micrometers), which is similar to the average decay length, then the number of observed decays would be around 1 - e^(-2.08/2.12) ≈1 - e^(-0.98)≈1 - 0.376≈0.624, so 62% of decays would be observed. but the question says "at least 30%", so even a lower resolution would suffice. wait, but the problem says "minimum resolution" to observe at least 30%. so the minimum resolution would be the resolution that allows exactly 30% of decays to be observed, which would be the distance d where 30% of decays happen, which is less than the average distance. wait, but if the average is ~2.1 micrometers, then 30% would be at a shorter distance. as calculated before, d = -v τ ln(0.7) ≈2.12e-6 m * 0.3567 ≈0.756e-6 m≈756 nanometers, which is around 0.75e-6 m. but none of the answer options match. the closest is 2.08e-6 m, which is answer d. but that's three times larger. alternatively, maybe the question is not about the distance where 30% decay, but the resolution needed to resolve the decay at the average distance. since the average decay length is ~2.1e-6 m, and the answer d is 2.08e-6 m, which is close. so perhaps the answer is d, assuming that the minimum resolution is on the order of the decay length. but i'm confused here. alternatively, maybe i made a mistake in calculating gamma. let me check. if the energy is 27 gev, and the mass is 3.41 gev, then the total energy is kinetic + rest mass. so if kinetic energy is 27 gev, rest mass is 3.41 gev, total energy is 30.41 gev. then gamma =30.41 /3.41≈8.917. so velocity: beta c = sqrt(1 -1/gamma2)=sqrt(1 -1/8.917^2)=sqrt(1 -1/79.5)=sqrt(0.987)=0.9935c. so velocity=0.9935*3e8≈2.98e8 m/s. then lifetime in lab frame tau=gamma tau0=8.917*8e-16≈7.13e-15 s. distance v*tau=2.98e8*7.13e-15≈2.11e-6 m≈2.11 micrometers. so the average decay length is about 2.1 micrometers. so if the resolution is 2.08e-6 m (option d), which is ~2.08 micrometers, that's close to the average. but how does this relate to observing 30% of the decays? if the resolution is the same order as the average decay length, then the chance of observing the decay would be significant. wait, perhaps the "resolution" refers to the time resolution, but the answer is given in meters. alternatively, maybe it's the spatial resolution, i.e., the precision in measuring the decay vertex position. if the decay length is 2.1 micrometers, then to resolve the decay (i.e., see it as a distinct vertex), the resolution must be smaller than that. however, the problem says "minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays". this phrasing is a bit unclear. if 30% of the decays are to be observed, maybe the resolution must be such that it can detect decays within a certain distance. but since the decays are spread out over an exponential distribution, perhaps the 30% corresponds to the containment within the resolution. alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the doppler effect in the decay, which enhances the lifetime in a particular direction, but i don't think so. alternatively, maybe the problem is simplified and just divides the average distance by some factor. wait, let's think of another approach. suppose the problem is simplified and doesn't consider relativistic addition of velocities or time dilation. let's see. if the proper lifetime is 8e-16 s, and the particle moves at velocity v. then in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau_0. the distance traveled is v gamma tau_0. if gamma is not considered, then it's just v tau_0. but the given answer options differ. but if the problem ignores gamma, then: velocity is found using classical kinetic energy: ke = (1/2) m v2. but with mass 3.41 gev/c2, kinetic energy 27 gev? that's a problem, since classical mechanics would never handle such energies. but for the sake of calculation, if we ignore relativity: ke = 1/2 m v2 =27 gev. m =3.41 gev/c2. but 1 gev =1.6e-10 j. so ke in joules:27 gev *1.6e-10 j/gev=4.32e-9 j. mass in kg:3.41 gev/c2 *1.78e-27 kg/gev=3.41*1.78e-27≈6.07e-27 kg. then v^2=2*ke/m=2*4.32e-9 j /6.07e-27 kg≈1.426e19 m2/s2, so v≈3.77e9 m/s, which is impossible, since it's higher than the speed of light. thus, classical mechanics is invalid here, so we must use relativistic mechanics. therefore, the initial approach with relativistic lifetime dilation and velocity is correct. given that the average distance is ~2.1 micrometers, and answer d is 2.08e-6 m, which is 2.08 micrometers. if the problem is asking for the average distance traveled, then answer d is close. but why 2.08 instead of 2.12? maybe due to rounding during calculations. let's check with precise numbers. given gamma=30.41 /3.41=exactly 30.41/3.41. let me calculate that: 3.41 × 9 = 30.69. but we have 30.41, so 30.41 /3.41 =9 - (0.28)/3.41≈9 -0.082≈8.918. so gamma≈8.918. then tau=8.918×8e-16=7.1344e-16 s. velocity: beta= sqrt(1 -1/(8.918)^2)=sqrt(1 -1/79.5)=sqrt(0.9874)=0.9937c. therefore, velocity=0.9937×299792458≈0.9937×299792458≈2.981e8 m/s. then, distance=2.981e8 m/s ×7.1344e-16 s=2.115e-7 meters? wait, 2.981e8 *7.1344e-16= (2.981*7.1344) *1e-8≈21.27*1e-8=2.127e-7 meters=2.127e-7 m=21.27 micrometers? wait, no, 1e-6 m is 1 micrometer, so 2.127e-7 m is 0.2127 micrometers. wait, that can't be. wait, 2.981e8 m/s *7.1344e-16 s=2.127e-7 m=0.2127e-6 m=0.2127 micrometers. wait, no—2.127e-7 m is 2.127 ×10^-7 m=0.2127 ×10^-6 m=0.2127 micrometers. but this contradicts the previous calculation which suggested ~2.1 micrometers. wait, no. wait, 2.981e8 meters per second times 7.1344e-16 seconds is: 2.981e8 *7.1344e-16 = (2.981 *7.1344) ×1e-8 m. 2.981*7.1344≈21. what's 2.981*7? 20.867. 2.981*0.1344≈0.401. total≈20.867+0.401≈21.268. so 21.268 ×1e-8 m=2.1268e-7 m=0.21268e-6 m=0
