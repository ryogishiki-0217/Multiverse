Okay, so I need to figure out which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck.
The key factors here are the apparent magnitudes that each spectrograph can observe.
ESPRESSO can go down to 17th magnitude in V, and HIRES can go to 16th.
So a star needs to be brighter than 16th magnitude for HIRES and brighter than 17th for ESPRESSO.
But since they have to be detectable by both, the limiting factor here is HIRES's magnitude limit of 16.
Wait, actually, no.
Let me clarify: the question says stars WITH BOTH.
So the star must be observable by both instruments.
Therefore, the star's apparent magnitude must be brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO and brighter than 16 for HIRES.
Wait, but ESPRESSO requires brighter than 17 V mag, so if a star is, say, 17th magnitude or fainter (higher number), then it's not detectable.
Wait, no, the problem says "brighter than 17 V mag can be observed".
So a star must have V magnitude less than 17 for ESPRESSO and less than 16 for HIRES.
Because in the magnitude scale, lower numbers are brighter.
So for a star to be detectable by both, its V magnitude must be less than 16 (since HIRES requires <16, and ESPRESSO <17, so the stricter limit is HIRES's <16).
Therefore, the star must have V magnitude less than 16.
So the apparent magnitude in V must be less than 16 for a star to be detectable by both.
But I need to check each star's apparent magnitude, right?
Wait, but some stars are given with absolute magnitude, so for those, I need to compute the apparent magnitude using the distance.
The formula for apparent magnitude is m = M + 5(log_{10}(d/10)) where M is absolute magnitude and d is distance in parsecs.
Also, some stars have extinction (E(B-V)) which affects the apparent magnitude.
The extinction in V band (A_V) is given by R_V * E(B-V), where R_V is typically 3.1.
So A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V).
Then, the extinction causes the observed magnitude to be brighter by A_V mag.
Wait, no.
Let me recall: extinction (dust) makes a star appear fainter (since it blocks light), so the true magnitude is actually brighter than observed.
So, if there's extinction, the intrinsic magnitude is m_true = m_observed + A_V.
But in this problem, when they give the apparent V magnitude, do they mean the observed or the extinction-corrected magnitude?
Wait, let's read the problem again carefully.
Let's think in parallel.

For the sake of simplicity, let's disregard the pointing limits of the telescopes (such as maximum and minimum elevations) as well as the altitudes of the telescopes.
So, the observatories can observe different parts of the sky based on their latitude.
Paranal is in Chile, at around -29 degrees latitude, so it can observe southern skies well.
Keck is in Hawaii, at about +20 degrees latitude, so it can observe northern skies.
But the problem says to disregard pointing limits, so we can assume that all stars are visible from both observatories.
So, the only constraints are the magnitudes.
So, we need to check each star's apparent V magnitude (correcting for extinction if necessary) and see if they are less than 16 (which would make them detectable by both).
Wait, but let's go star by star.
Let's think in parallel.

1: Star1 has an absolute V magnitude of 15.5 mag and is located at 10 pc. The apparent magnitude (m) is calculated using the distance modulus formula: m = M + 5(log10(d) - 1). Substituting the values, m = 15.5 + 5(log10(10) - 1) = 15.5 + 5(1 - 1) = 15.5. Star1 has an apparent magnitude of 15.5 mag. This value is derived from its absolute magnitude and distance, without any extinction correction. Star1's RA is 15 deg and DEC is -75 deg. This star is located in the southern sky. The Paranal Observatory in Chile.
</Path>
<Path>
2: Star2 has an RA of 30 degrees and a DEC of 55 degrees, an apparent V magnitude of 16.5 mag, and is located at 5 parsecs distance. The problem provides Star2's apparent magnitude directly as 16.5 mag. This magnitude is not corrected for extinction. The star's E(B-V) value is not given, implying no extinction correction is needed. Star2's stated apparent magnitude is 16.5 mag, which is fainter than the 16 mag limit for HIRES. Consequently, Star2 cannot be observed by HIRES. Star2 also fails the ESPRESSO limit, as its magnitude of 16.5 is fainter than the 17 mag threshold. Star2 is undetectable by either spectrograph for Star2.
</Path>
<Path>
3: Star3's apparent magnitude (m) is 15.5 mag, and its E(B-V) color excess is 0.6 mag. The total absorption in the V band (A_V) is calculated using the formula A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V), resulting in A_V = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag. The extinction causes the observed magnitude to be fainter than the intrinsic magnitude. The intrinsic (extinction-corrected) apparent magnitude (m_intrinsic) is therefore the observed magnitude minus the extinction, which is 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64 mag. This corrected magnitude is less than 16, so Star3 is detectable by both instruments.
</Path>
<Path>
4: Star4 has a right ascension (RA) of 85 degrees, a declination (DEC) of -48 degrees, an absolute V magnitude (M) of 15.5 mag, a color excess E(B-V) of 0.4 mag, and a distance of 10 pc. The total absorption in the V band (A_V) is calculated using the formula A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V), which results in A_V = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag. The apparent magnitude (m) is determined using the distance modulus formula: m = M + 5 * log10(d/10), where d is the distance in parsecs. Substituting the given values, m = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10/10) = 15.5 + 0 = 15.5.
Star4's extinction-corrected apparent magnitude is 16.74 mag.
This magnitude is fainter than the ESPRESSO limit (17 mag) but brighter than the HIRES limit (16 mag).
Star4 is detectable by ESPRESSO but not by HIRES.
Star4 is therefore not detectable by both instruments.
</Path>
<Path>
5: Star5 has an absolute V magnitude of 16.5 mag and is located at a distance of 5 parsecs. The apparent magnitude (m) is calculated as m = M + 5*(log10(d/10)). The distance ratio d/10 is 5/10 = 0.5, and its logarithm (base 10) is approximately -0.3010. The calculation proceeds as m = 16.5 + (5 * -0.3010) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 14.995, which is approximately 15.0 mag. Star5 has an apparent magnitude of 15.0 mag. The problem states to disregard extinction for Star5.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
Star1 has an apparent magnitude of 15.5, Star2 has an apparent magnitude of 16.5, Star3 has an extinction-corrected apparent magnitude of 13.64, Star4 has an extinction-corrected apparent magnitude of 16.74, and Star5 has an apparent magnitude of 15.0, based on their respective parameters.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Wait, so Star1 is 15.5 (detectable by both).
Star2 is 16.5 (detectable by ESPRESSO only).
Star3 is 13.64 (detectable by both).
Star4 is 16.74 (detectable by ESPRESSO only).
Star5 is 15.0 (detectable by both).
So which stars are detectable by both?
Star1 (15.5), Star3 (13.64), Star5 (15.0).
So the possible answers must be pairs among these.
The options are: A) Star1 and Star4, but Star4 is not detectable by both.
B) Star2 and Star3: Star2 is 16.5, so only ESPRESSO.
But Star3 is detectable by both.
Hmm, but Star2 is not.
So B is incorrect.
C) Star3 and Star5: both detectable by both.
So C is a candidate.
D) Star4 and Star5: Star4 is detectable by ESPRESSO only, so no.
So the correct answer must be C.
But let me double-check Star3 and Star5.
Star3's extinction-corrected magnitude is 13.64 (so observed magnitude was 15.5, but after correcting for extinction, it's 13.64.
But wait, does the spectrograph observe the star's light as it is observed (i.e., affected by extinction) or the intrinsic light?
Wait, the problem says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed", so the apparent magnitude as observed, right?
Because that's what the telescope would detect.
So when they mention the magnitude limits, they're talking about the observed magnitude.
But in the star data, for some stars, the given magnitude is the observed one, and for others, we have to calculate it.
Wait, let's clarify.
For Star1, it gives the absolute magnitude and distance, so we can compute the apparent magnitude (which would be the observed one, before extinction?).
Wait, no.
The formula m = M + distance modulus gives the absolute magnitude (which is the intrinsic brightness).
Then extinction would make the star appear fainter, so the observed magnitude is m_obs = m_true + A_V.
Wait, so when the problem says "apparent V magnitude", that's the observed magnitude, which includes the effect of extinction.
So for Star1, they gave the absolute V magnitude (which is the true, intrinsic magnitude) and the distance.
Then, the apparent magnitude (observed) would be calculated using m = M + 5(log_{10}(d/10)) + A_V.
Wait, but they didn't give E(B-V) for Star1, so maybe A_V is zero for Star1.
Wait, the problem says "Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1."
So unless E(B-V) is given, we can assume it's zero.
So for stars where E(B-V) is not mentioned, there is no extinction.
Therefore, for Star1, Star2, and Star5, there is no extinction (since E(B-V) is only given for Star3 and Star4).
Therefore, for Star1, the apparent magnitude would be calculated without A_V.
So Star1's apparent magnitude is m = M + 5(log10(d/10)) = 15.5 + 5(log10(10/10)) = 15.5 + 0 = 15.5.
So observed magnitude is 15.5.
Since this is brighter than 16 and 17, detectable by both.
Star2: given apparent V magnitude of 16.5.
Since no extinction mentioned, so observed magnitude is 16.5.
This is fainter than 16, so only detectable by ESPRESSO.
Star3: given apparent V magnitude of 15.5, but E(B-V)=0.6.
So A_V = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86.
Therefore, the intrinsic magnitude is m_true = observed - A_V = 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64.
But the spectrographs observe the light as it is affected by extinction, so the observed magnitude is 15.5.
Therefore, even though the true magnitude is 13.64, the observed is 15.5.
Wait, but does the instrument detect the star based on the observed magnitude or the intrinsic?
The problem says "apparent V magnitude".
So the apparent is what is observed, which includes dimming from extinction.
So the observed magnitude is given for Star3 as 15.5.
Therefore, regardless of extinction, the apparent (observed) magnitude is 15.5.
Therefore, same as Star1, it's 15.5.
So both Star1 and Star3 have observed magnitudes of 15.5.
Wait, but in Star3's case, the problem says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag".
So in this case, the given apparent magnitude is the observed one (which is already dimmed by extinction).
Therefore, even though the intrinsic magnitude is 13.64, the observed magnitude is 15.5.
Therefore, for the purpose of detection by the instruments, it's the observed magnitude that matters.
So Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5, same as Star1.
Therefore, Star3 is detectable by both.
Wait, so maybe I was wrong before when I thought extinction affects the observed magnitude.
But no, extinction is already factored into the given apparent magnitude.
So if a star has an apparent magnitude of 15.5 and E(B-V)=0.6, the intrinsic magnitude is brighter, but the observed magnitude is 15.5.
Therefore, the spectrograph would observe the 15.5 magnitude.
Therefore, Star3 is observed at 15.5, which is bright enough for both instruments.
Similarly, Star4 has an apparent magnitude calculated from absolute magnitude and distance, with extinction.
Star4's data: absolute V magnitude 15.5, E(B-V)=0.4, distance 10 pc.
So first, calculate the true (intrinsic) apparent magnitude: m_true = M + 5(log10(10/10)) = 15.5 + 0 = 15.5.
Then, the extinction causes the observed magnitude to be m_obs = m_true + A_V = 15.5 + 3.1*0.4 = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74.
Therefore, Star4's observed apparent magnitude is 16.74.
Which is fainter than 16, so detectable by ESPRESSO (which can go to 17) but not by HIRES (which needs <16).
Therefore, Star4 is out.
Star5: absolute magnitude 16.5, distance 5 pc.
m = M + 5(log10(5/10)) = 16.5 + 5*(-0.3010) ≈ 16.5 - 1.505 ≈ 14.995 ≈ 15.0.
So Star5's apparent magnitude is 15.0, detectable by both.
So, stars detectable by both are Star1 (15.5), Star3 (15.5), and Star5 (15.0).
Therefore, the possible pairs are Star1 and Star3, Star1 and Star5, or Star3 and Star5.
Looking at the options, C) Star3 and Star5.
So the answer should be C.
Wait, let me confirm each star's observability:
Star1: observed mag 15.5 -> yes to both.
Star2: observed mag 16.5 -> only ESPRESSO.
Star3: observed mag 15.5 -> yes to both.
Star4: observed mag 16.74 -> only ESPRESSO.
Star5: observed mag 15.0 -> yes to both.
So pairs that are detectable by both are (Star1, Star3), (Star1, Star5), (Star3, Star5).
The options given are: A: Star1 and Star4 -> no, since Star4 is not detectable by both. B: Star2 and Star3 -> no, Star2 is not. C: Star3 and Star5 -> yes. D: Star4 and Star5 -> no, Star4 is not. Therefore, the answer is C.
Wait, but let me check the extinction for Star3 again.
Star3's given apparent V magnitude is 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6.
So, does that mean the observed magnitude is 15.5, and the intrinsic is 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64?
So even though the intrinsic is 13.64, due to extinction, it's observed as 15.5.
So the spectrograph would see the 15.5 magnitude.
Therefore, Star3's apparent (observed) magnitude is 15.5, which is within the limits of both instruments.
So Star3 is okay.
Similarly, Star4's calculation: absolute mag 15.5, distance 10 pc, so true app mag is 15.5.
Then with A_V = 1.24, observed mag is 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74.
So even though the intrinsic is 15.5, the observed is 16.74.
So Star4 is observed at 16.74, which is too faint for HIRES but bright enough for ESPRESSO.
Therefore, Star4 is not detectable by both.
So answer is C.
**Final Answer** 
\boxed{C}
</Think>

Answer: To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph (which requires stars brighter than 17th magnitude) and the HIRES spectrograph (which requires stars brighter than 16th magnitude), we need to check the apparent V magnitudes of each star. The star must have an apparent magnitude brighter than 16th (i.e., less than 16) to be detected by both instruments.

1. **Star1**:  
   - Absolute magnitude \( M = 15.5 \), distance \( d = 10 \) pc.  
   - Apparent magnitude \( m = M + 5(\log_{10}(d/10)) = 15.5 + 0 = 15.5 \).  
   - Magnitude 15.5 is brighter than 16, so detectable by both.

2. **Star2**:  
   - Apparent magnitude \( m = 16.5 \).  
   - Magnitude 16.5 is fainter than 16, so only detectable by ESPRESSO.

3. **Star3**:  
   - Apparent magnitude \( m = 15.5 \), with extinction \( E(B-V) = 0.6 \).  
   - Extinction causes the observed magnitude to be 15.5, which is brighter than 16, so detectable by both.

4. **Star4**:  
   - Absolute magnitude \( M = 15.5 \), distance \( d = 10 \) pc, \( E(B-V) = 0.4 \).  
   - True apparent magnitude \( m = 15.5 \).  
   - With extinction \( A_V = 3.1 \times 0.4 = 1.24 \), observed magnitude \( m = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74 \).  
   - Magnitude 16.74 is fainter than 16, so only detectable by ESPRESSO.

5. **Star5**:  
   - Absolute magnitude \( M = 16.5 \), distance \( d = 5 \) pc.  
   - Apparent magnitude \( m = 16.5 + 5(\log_{10}(5/10)) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 15.0 \).  
   - Magnitude 15.0 is brighter than 16, so detectable by both.

Stars detectable by both instruments are Star1, Star3, and Star5. The correct pair from the options is Star3 and Star5.

for the sake of simplicity, let's disregard the pointing limits of the telescopes (such as maximum and minimum elevations) as well as the altitudes of the telescopes.
so, the observatories can observe different parts of the sky based on their latitude.
paranal is in chile, at around -29 degrees latitude, so it can observe southern skies well.
keck is in hawaii, at about +20 degrees latitude, so it can observe northern skies.
but the problem says to disregard pointing limits, so we can assume that all stars are visible from both observatories.
so, the only constraints are the magnitudes.
so, we need to check each star's apparent v magnitude (correcting for extinction if necessary) and see if they are less than 16 (which would make them detectable by both).
wait, but let's go star by star.
let's think in parallel.

1: star1 has an absolute v magnitude of 15.5 mag and is located at 10 pc. the apparent magnitude (m) is calculated using the distance modulus formula: m = m + 5(log10(d) - 1). substituting the values, m = 15.5 + 5(log10(10) - 1) = 15.5 + 5(1 - 1) = 15.5. star1 has an apparent magnitude of 15.5 mag. this value is derived from its absolute magnitude and distance, without any extinction correction. star1's ra is 15 deg and dec is -75 deg. this star is located in the southern sky. the paranal observatory in chile.
</path>
<path>
2: star2 has an ra of 30 degrees and a dec of 55 degrees, an apparent v magnitude of 16.5 mag, and is located at 5 parsecs distance. the problem provides star2's apparent magnitude directly as 16.5 mag. this magnitude is not corrected for extinction. the star's e(b-v) value is not given, implying no extinction correction is needed. star2's stated apparent magnitude is 16.5 mag, which is fainter than the 16 mag limit for hires. consequently, star2 cannot be observed by hires. star2 also fails the espresso limit, as its magnitude of 16.5 is fainter than the 17 mag threshold. star2 is undetectable by either spectrograph for star2.
</path>
<path>
3: star3's apparent magnitude (m) is 15.5 mag, and its e(b-v) color excess is 0.6 mag. the total absorption in the v band (a_v) is calculated using the formula a_v = 3.1 * e(b-v), resulting in a_v = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag. the extinction causes the observed magnitude to be fainter than the intrinsic magnitude. the intrinsic (extinction-corrected) apparent magnitude (m_intrinsic) is therefore the observed magnitude minus the extinction, which is 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64 mag. this corrected magnitude is less than 16, so star3 is detectable by both instruments.
</path>
<path>
4: star4 has a right ascension (ra) of 85 degrees, a declination (dec) of -48 degrees, an absolute v magnitude (m) of 15.5 mag, a color excess e(b-v) of 0.4 mag, and a distance of 10 pc. the total absorption in the v band (a_v) is calculated using the formula a_v = 3.1 * e(b-v), which results in a_v = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24 mag. the apparent magnitude (m) is determined using the distance modulus formula: m = m + 5 * log10(d/10), where d is the distance in parsecs. substituting the given values, m = 15.5 + 5 * log10(10/10) = 15.5 + 0 = 15.5.
star4's extinction-corrected apparent magnitude is 16.74 mag.
this magnitude is fainter than the espresso limit (17 mag) but brighter than the hires limit (16 mag).
star4 is detectable by espresso but not by hires.
star4 is therefore not detectable by both instruments.
</path>
<path>
5: star5 has an absolute v magnitude of 16.5 mag and is located at a distance of 5 parsecs. the apparent magnitude (m) is calculated as m = m + 5*(log10(d/10)). the distance ratio d/10 is 5/10 = 0.5, and its logarithm (base 10) is approximately -0.3010. the calculation proceeds as m = 16.5 + (5 * -0.3010) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 14.995, which is approximately 15.0 mag. star5 has an apparent magnitude of 15.0 mag. the problem states to disregard extinction for star5.
</path>
<conclusion>
star1 has an apparent magnitude of 15.5, star2 has an apparent magnitude of 16.5, star3 has an extinction-corrected apparent magnitude of 13.64, star4 has an extinction-corrected apparent magnitude of 16.74, and star5 has an apparent magnitude of 15.0, based on their respective parameters.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
wait, so star1 is 15.5 (detectable by both).
star2 is 16.5 (detectable by espresso only).
star3 is 13.64 (detectable by both).
star4 is 16.74 (detectable by espresso only).
star5 is 15.0 (detectable by both).
so which stars are detectable by both?
star1 (15.5), star3 (13.64), star5 (15.0).
so the possible answers must be pairs among these.
the options are: a) star1 and star4, but star4 is not detectable by both.
b) star2 and star3: star2 is 16.5, so only espresso.
but star3 is detectable by both.
hmm, but star2 is not.
so b is incorrect.
c) star3 and star5: both detectable by both.
so c is a candidate.
d) star4 and star5: star4 is detectable by espresso only, so no.
so the correct answer must be c.
but let me double-check star3 and star5.
star3's extinction-corrected magnitude is 13.64 (so observed magnitude was 15.5, but after correcting for extinction, it's 13.64.
but wait, does the spectrograph observe the star's light as it is observed (i.e., affected by extinction) or the intrinsic light?
wait, the problem says "stars with apparent v magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed", so the apparent magnitude as observed, right?
because that's what the telescope would detect.
so when they mention the magnitude limits, they're talking about the observed magnitude.
but in the star data, for some stars, the given magnitude is the observed one, and for others, we have to calculate it.
wait, let's clarify.
for star1, it gives the absolute magnitude and distance, so we can compute the apparent magnitude (which would be the observed one, before extinction?).
wait, no.
the formula m = m + distance modulus gives the absolute magnitude (which is the intrinsic brightness).
then extinction would make the star appear fainter, so the observed magnitude is m_obs = m_true + a_v.
wait, so when the problem says "apparent v magnitude", that's the observed magnitude, which includes the effect of extinction.
so for star1, they gave the absolute v magnitude (which is the true, intrinsic magnitude) and the distance.
then, the apparent magnitude (observed) would be calculated using m = m + 5(log_{10}(d/10)) + a_v.
wait, but they didn't give e(b-v) for star1, so maybe a_v is zero for star1.
wait, the problem says "note that the total absorption in the v band is related to the color excess in b-v with a coefficient equal to 3.1."
so unless e(b-v) is given, we can assume it's zero.
so for stars where e(b-v) is not mentioned, there is no extinction.
therefore, for star1, star2, and star5, there is no extinction (since e(b-v) is only given for star3 and star4).
therefore, for star1, the apparent magnitude would be calculated without a_v.
so star1's apparent magnitude is m = m + 5(log10(d/10)) = 15.5 + 5(log10(10/10)) = 15.5 + 0 = 15.5.
so observed magnitude is 15.5.
since this is brighter than 16 and 17, detectable by both.
star2: given apparent v magnitude of 16.5.
since no extinction mentioned, so observed magnitude is 16.5.
this is fainter than 16, so only detectable by espresso.
star3: given apparent v magnitude of 15.5, but e(b-v)=0.6.
so a_v = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86.
therefore, the intrinsic magnitude is m_true = observed - a_v = 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64.
but the spectrographs observe the light as it is affected by extinction, so the observed magnitude is 15.5.
therefore, even though the true magnitude is 13.64, the observed is 15.5.
wait, but does the instrument detect the star based on the observed magnitude or the intrinsic?
the problem says "apparent v magnitude".
so the apparent is what is observed, which includes dimming from extinction.
so the observed magnitude is given for star3 as 15.5.
therefore, regardless of extinction, the apparent (observed) magnitude is 15.5.
therefore, same as star1, it's 15.5.
so both star1 and star3 have observed magnitudes of 15.5.
wait, but in star3's case, the problem says "apparent v magnitude of 15.5 mag, e(b-v) = 0.6 mag".
so in this case, the given apparent magnitude is the observed one (which is already dimmed by extinction).
therefore, even though the intrinsic magnitude is 13.64, the observed magnitude is 15.5.
therefore, for the purpose of detection by the instruments, it's the observed magnitude that matters.
so star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5, same as star1.
therefore, star3 is detectable by both.
wait, so maybe i was wrong before when i thought extinction affects the observed magnitude.
but no, extinction is already factored into the given apparent magnitude.
so if a star has an apparent magnitude of 15.5 and e(b-v)=0.6, the intrinsic magnitude is brighter, but the observed magnitude is 15.5.
therefore, the spectrograph would observe the 15.5 magnitude.
therefore, star3 is observed at 15.5, which is bright enough for both instruments.
similarly, star4 has an apparent magnitude calculated from absolute magnitude and distance, with extinction.
star4's data: absolute v magnitude 15.5, e(b-v)=0.4, distance 10 pc.
so first, calculate the true (intrinsic) apparent magnitude: m_true = m + 5(log10(10/10)) = 15.5 + 0 = 15.5.
then, the extinction causes the observed magnitude to be m_obs = m_true + a_v = 15.5 + 3.1*0.4 = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74.
therefore, star4's observed apparent magnitude is 16.74.
which is fainter than 16, so detectable by espresso (which can go to 17) but not by hires (which needs <16).
therefore, star4 is out.
star5: absolute magnitude 16.5, distance 5 pc.
m = m + 5(log10(5/10)) = 16.5 + 5*(-0.3010) ≈ 16.5 - 1.505 ≈ 14.995 ≈ 15.0.
so star5's apparent magnitude is 15.0, detectable by both.
so, stars detectable by both are star1 (15.5), star3 (15.5), and star5 (15.0).
therefore, the possible pairs are star1 and star3, star1 and star5, or star3 and star5.
looking at the options, c) star3 and star5.
so the answer should be c.
wait, let me confirm each star's observability:
star1: observed mag 15.5 -> yes to both.
star2: observed mag 16.5 -> only espresso.
star3: observed mag 15.5 -> yes to both.
star4: observed mag 16.74 -> only espresso.
star5: observed mag 15.0 -> yes to both.
so pairs that are detectable by both are (star1, star3), (star1, star5), (star3, star5).
the options given are: a: star1 and star4 -> no, since star4 is not detectable by both. b: star2 and star3 -> no, star2 is not. c: star3 and star5 -> yes. d: star4 and star5 -> no, star4 is not. therefore, the answer is c.
wait, but let me check the extinction for star3 again.
star3's given apparent v magnitude is 15.5, and e(b-v)=0.6.
so, does that mean the observed magnitude is 15.5, and the intrinsic is 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64?
so even though the intrinsic is 13.64, due to extinction, it's observed as 15.5.
so the spectrograph would see the 15.5 magnitude.
therefore, star3's apparent (observed) magnitude is 15.5, which is within the limits of both instruments.
so star3 is okay.
similarly, star4's calculation: absolute mag 15.5, distance 10 pc, so true app mag is 15.5.
then with a_v = 1.24, observed mag is 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74.
so even though the intrinsic is 15.5, the observed is 16.74.
so star4 is observed at 16.74, which is too faint for hires but bright enough for espresso.
therefore, star4 is not detectable by both.
so answer is c.
**final answer** 
\boxed{c}

answer: to determine which stars can be detected by both the espresso spectrograph (which requires stars brighter than 17th magnitude) and the hires spectrograph (which requires stars brighter than 16th magnitude), we need to check the apparent v magnitudes of each star. the star must have an apparent magnitude brighter than 16th (i.e., less than 16) to be detected by both instruments.

1. **star1**:  
   - absolute magnitude \( m = 15.5 \), distance \( d = 10 \) pc.  
   - apparent magnitude \( m = m + 5(\log_{10}(d/10)) = 15.5 + 0 = 15.5 \).  
   - magnitude 15.5 is brighter than 16, so detectable by both.

2. **star2**:  
   - apparent magnitude \( m = 16.5 \).  
   - magnitude 16.5 is fainter than 16, so only detectable by espresso.

3. **star3**:  
   - apparent magnitude \( m = 15.5 \), with extinction \( e(b-v) = 0.6 \).  
   - extinction causes the observed magnitude to be 15.5, which is brighter than 16, so detectable by both.

4. **star4**:  
   - absolute magnitude \( m = 15.5 \), distance \( d = 10 \) pc, \( e(b-v) = 0.4 \).  
   - true apparent magnitude \( m = 15.5 \).  
   - with extinction \( a_v = 3.1 \times 0.4 = 1.24 \), observed magnitude \( m = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74 \).  
   - magnitude 16.74 is fainter than 16, so only detectable by espresso.

5. **star5**:  
   - absolute magnitude \( m = 16.5 \), distance \( d = 5 \) pc.  
   - apparent magnitude \( m = 16.5 + 5(\log_{10}(5/10)) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 15.0 \).  
   - magnitude 15.0 is brighter than 16, so detectable by both.

stars detectable by both instruments are star1, star3, and star5. the correct pair from the options is star3 and star5.

\boxed{c}
