Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step.
It's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down.
The problem involves an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorize bromine water.
When treated with platinum and heat, they undergo disproportionation to form mixture Y, which doesn't decolorize bromine water.
Both X and Y, when hydrogenated with platinum under severe conditions, produce the same hydrocarbon Z.
Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28% and is a constituent of Y.
Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, and there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the compounds of X.
We need to find the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.
First, let's parse the key information:
1. **Mixture X**: Equimolar, two liquids, decolorize bromine water (indicating presence of double bonds or other reactive groups like conjugated dienes or triple bonds).
2. **Disproportionation with Pt heat**: Forms mixture Y (also equimolar, two other liquids) which doesn't decolorize bromine water.
3. **Hydrogenation of X and Y**: Both lead to the same hydrocarbon Z.
4. **Hydrocarbon Z**: Mass % H is 14.28%, a constituent of Y, used as a solvent, doesn't react further with H2 (saturated), no conjugated bonds in X.
The question is the total number of H atoms in the two liquids of X.
Let's start by figuring out what hydrocarbon Z is.
Since Z is a constituent of Y and is a solvent, widely used, and has 14.28% hydrogen by mass.
Let's calculate the empirical formula for Z.
Hydrocarbon Z: H% = 14.28%, so C% = 100 - 14.28 = 85.72%.
Assume 100 g of Z: 85.72 g C, 14.28 g H.
Convert to moles:
C: 85.72 / 12 ≈ 7.143 moles
H: 14.28 / 1 ≈ 14.28 moles
Divide by smallest number:
C: 7.143 / 7.143 ≈ 1
H: 14.28 / 7.143 ≈ 2
So empirical formula is CH2.
So the hydrocarbon is likely ethylene (C2H4)? But wait, Z is saturated (doesn't react with H2), so ethylene (C2H4) is unsaturated.
Wait, that can't be. Wait, maybe I miscalculated. Wait, if the empirical formula is CH2, possible hydrocarbons are C2H4, C3H6, etc. But Z is saturated? Because it doesn't react further with H2. Wait, that's confusing. Wait, if Z is the product of hydrogenation, then Z should be saturated. But if the empirical formula is CH2, that suggests it's an alkene (CnH2n). But alkenes would require hydrogenation, so if Z is the product, then maybe it's an alkane? Wait, the problem says hydrogenation of X and Y gives Z. So X and Y are unsaturated, and Z is saturated. So Z should have the formula CnH2n+2. But the empirical formula based on mass % is CH2. So perhaps Z is an alkane? Let me check. If Z is an alkane CnH2n+2, then the mass % H is (2n+2)/(12n + 2n +2)*100. We are given that as 14.28%, so let's compute: (2n + 2)/(14n + 2) = 14.28/100 = 0.1428.
So, (2n + 2)/(14n + 2) = 0.1428.
Multiply both sides by (14n + 2):
2n + 2 = 0.1428*(14n + 2)
Let me compute RHS:
0.1428*(14n + 2) = 0.1428*14n + 0.1428*2 ≈ 2.0n + 0.2856
So:
2n + 2 ≈ 2.0n + 0.2856
Subtract 2n from both sides:
2 ≈ 0.2856
Which is not possible. So clearly, this approach is wrong. Perhaps Z isn't an alkane. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the formula. Let's approach again. Let me recompute the empirical formula: Given H% = 14.28%, so in 100g of Z, H = 14.28g, C = 85.72g.
Moles of C: 85.72 / 12 ≈ 7.143
Moles of H: 14.28 / 1 ≈ 14.28
Mole ratio: C:H ≈ 1:2, so empirical formula is CH2.
Therefore, the molecular formula must be (CH2)n.
Now, since Z is a hydrocarbon and the empirical formula is CH2, possible candidates are ethylene (C2H4), cyclohexane (C6H12), etc. But Z is a solvent and widely used. Also, Z is a constituent of Y, which is formed by disproportionation of X. Also, X's components have no conjugated double bonds. Hmm. Disproportionation usually involves a reaction where the same molecule is both oxidized and reduced. For example, in the case of aldehydes forming acids and alcohols, but here we are dealing with hydrocarbons. Wait, another example is the disproportionation of 2-hexyne to hexane and 3-hexyne under certain conditions. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, think about the fact that mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water, so the products are saturated. Since X decolorizes bromine (i.e., has double bonds or triple bonds), when they disproportionate, they form a mixture of saturated compounds (maybe one with longer chains or different structures). But after hydrogenation, both X and Y become Z, which is a saturated hydrocarbon. Since Z is a constituent of Y, that means Y has Z and another compound. But when Y is hydrogenated, it becomes Z. That suggests that the other compound in Y is an unsaturated hydrocarbon which, upon hydrogenation, becomes Z as well. Wait, but if Y is the product of disproportionation, then maybe the two components of Y are Z and another compound which, upon hydrogenation, also gives Z. That would mean the other compound in Y is an isomer of Z that can hydrogenate to Z, but that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe during hydrogenation, some structural rearrangement happens, but usually hydrogenation is supposed to be selective. Wait, but the problem states that both mixture X and mixture Y hydrogenate to give only one substance, Z. So both components of X hydrogenate to Z, and both components of Y hydrogenate to Z. Therefore, Z must be a saturated hydrocarbon that can be formed both by hydrogenating the components of X (which are unsaturated) and by hydrogenating the components of Y (which might be a mixture of a saturated and an unsaturated compound, but the problem says both components of Y hydrogenate to Z). Wait, but mixture Y is said to be an equimolar mixture of two liquids, which do not decolorize bromine water (so they are saturated). Therefore, both components of Y are saturated compounds, which when hydrogenated (even though they are already saturated) don't react further, but maybe they isomerize? But the problem says "no further reaction with hydrogen" for Z. Wait, but if Y's components are saturated, then hydrogenation would not do anything. But the problem says that hydrogenation of Y gives Z. So perhaps Y's components are cyclic or have some functional groups that can be hydrogenated? Wait, but if they don't decolorize bromine, they must be saturated. Alternatively, maybe Y's components are aldehydes or something else, but the problem specifies hydrocarbons. Wait, the problem states that "Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y in the presence of platinum under rather severe conditions gives only one substance, a certain hydrocarbon Z..." So, even though Y's components might be saturated, they undergo some reaction under severe conditions. But normally, severe conditions with H2 and Pt might indicate isomerization or something else, but the problem states it's hydrogenation. Wait, maybe the components of Y are conjugated dienes, but then they would decolorize bromine water. But the problem says Y does not decolorize. Alternatively, maybe the components of Y are more substituted alkenes that are harder to hydrogenate, but the question says after treatment with Pt and heat, they don't decolorize bromine. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not simple hydrogenation but some other type of reaction. Wait, but the problem statement says "Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y...". Let's pause. Let's think of possible hydrocarbons Z that are solvents. Common hydrocarbon solvents are things like hexane, benzene (though it's not an alkane), but benzene would have 7.7% hydrogen. Wait, hexane (C6H14) has mass % H: (14 / 86) * 100 ≈ 16.28%. The given value is 14.28%. Let's check pentane (C5H12): (12 / 72) *100 ≈ 16.66%. Not matching. Heptane (C7H16): 16 / 100 *approx*, no. Maybe something else. Wait, cyclohexane: C6H12. Mass % H: 12 / 84 ≈ 14.28%. Yes! 12 hydrogen / (6*12 + 12*1) = 12/84 ≈ 0.142857, which is 14.28%. So cyclohexane (C6H12) is a possible candidate for Z. Cyclohexane is a common solvent, and 14.28% H matches. So Z is cyclohexane. Then, mixture Y contains cyclohexane and another compound. Since Y is formed by disproportionation of X, which is an equimolar mixture of two liquids with double bonds (since they decolorize bromine water). Disproportionation often involves the same compound forming products of different oxidation states. For example, in the case of 2-hexyne, under certain conditions, it can disproportionate into hexane and 3-hexyne. But here, maybe the reactants are conjugated dienes. Wait, but the problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X. So perhaps X has isolated double bonds or isolated triple bonds. Wait, if Z is cyclohexane, then hydrogenation of X (which are unsaturated compounds) would lead to cyclohexane. So the components of X must be cyclohexene or something that becomes cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. Wait, but cyclohexene hydrogenated is cyclohexane. So if X is cyclohexene, but cyclohexene has a single double bond, so adding H2 would give cyclohexane. But if X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, perhaps cyclohexene and something else? Wait, but cyclohexane is a constituent of Y, which is formed by disproportionation of X. Disproportionation usually requires a reactant that can form products of different oxidation states. If X is a single compound, but here X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. Wait, maybe the problem is about the oxidation of one molecule and reduction of another. Wait, perhaps the liquids in X are such that when heated with platinum, one undergoes oxidation (forming a more oxidized product) and the other reduction (more reduced product). For example, if X is a mixture of an alkene and an alkyne. Let's say, for example, X is an alkene and another alkene. Wait, but how would that disproportionate? Alternatively, maybe X contains a diene and an alkene. But the problem says no conjugated multiple bonds. Hmm. Wait, if Z is cyclohexane, and Y is a mixture of cyclohexane and another compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Let's say, for example, Y is cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane. But when you hydrogenate methylcyclohexane, you get cyclohexane. But if that's the case, then X must be something that forms cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane upon some reaction. But the problem states that X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. Let's think: If X is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexene and another compound, say a conjugated diene... Wait, but cyclohexene has one double bond. If you mix it with another compound, maybe with two double bonds, then under certain conditions, they could react to form cyclohexane and another product. But I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, let's think about the fact that the problem mentions "disproportionation". Disproportionation typically involves a species that is both oxidized and reduced. For example, 2 HOCl → HCl + HClO2. In organic chemistry, a ketone can disproportionate to give alcohol and aldehyde under certain conditions. But in this case, maybe a dihalide? Wait, maybe the liquids in X are halogenated hydrocarbons? But the problem states they decolorize bromine water. Normally, alkenes and dienes react with bromine to decolorize bromine water. So X likely consists of alkenes or dienes. Upon treatment with Pt and heat, they might undergo some type of reaction. Wait, another thought: The reaction of alkenes with platinum under heat can lead to hydrogenation or possibly isomerization. But if it's hydrogenation, then the product would be alkanes. But in the problem, the products Y still have two liquids. If X is an alkene and a diene, then hydrogenation would give alkanes, but the problem says Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so they must be saturated. But if Y is formed by hydrogenation, then why would further hydrogenation of Y give Z? Unless the conditions are different. Wait, maybe the first reaction is not full hydrogenation. Wait, the problem says that when treated with platinum when heated, X becomes Y through disproportionation, not necessarily hydrogenation. Then, separately, both X and Y when hydrogenated with platinum under severe conditions give Z. So maybe the initial reaction (disproportionation) doesn't involve H2, just heating with Pt. For example, certain alkenes can undergo ring formation or other reactions. Wait, for instance, if X is a mixture of two alkenes, say 1-hexene and another alkene. Upon heating with platinum, which can act as an acid and cause rearrangements. But I'm not familiar with such a reaction. Alternatively, maybe the alkenes undergo a [2+4] cycloaddition, but that would require specific conditions and might not be disproportionation. Alternatively, think about allene. However, allene is a triply bonded compound, but it also decolorizes bromine water. If X is allene and another compound, but I'm not sure. Wait, the problem says that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X. So any double bonds in X are isolated. So, if X has two liquids with isolated double bonds, and when heated with platinum, they might undergo some type of reaction. For example, if one of the compounds in X has a triple bond (since triple bonds are more reactive), but triple bonds are also isolated, maybe. Wait, but triple bonds can decolorize bromine as well. Wait, let's think about acetylene vs. allene. Acetylene is a triple bond, allene is two double bonds, but in allene, they are not conjugated (if it's something like CH2=CH-CH=CH2?), but the problem says no conjugated bonds. Wait, allene is CH2=C=CH2, which has a triple bond equivalent, but actually, it's two double bonds with a carbon atom in between. Wait, allene (CH2=C=CH2) has a cumulated double bond, but cumulated double bonds are not conjugated because there's no alternating single and double bonds. Wait, but cumulated double bonds are typically in a straight line and not conjugated. However, allene (CH2=C=CH2) can react with bromine. Alternatively, maybe the compounds in X are such that when heated over platinum, they undergo ozonolysis or something else. But ozonolysis requires O3, not H2. Hmm. Another angle: The fact that Z is cyclohexane (assuming 14.28% H is cyclohexane). Then, what would X be? If X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that hydrogenate to cyclohexane. So, possible X components could be cyclohexene and another compound that upon hydrogenation becomes cyclohexane. But if X is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexene and 1,3-cyclohexadiene, then hydrogenation would convert both to cyclohexane. But 1,3-cyclohexadiene is a conjugated diene, but the problem says there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X. Therefore, that's out. Alternatively, X could be a mixture of two different cyclohexene isomers, but I don't think that would form different products upon hydrogenation. Wait, if X is a mixture of two alkenes, each with three double bonds? No, that seems unlikely. Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of two different compounds, each with a double bond and a triple bond? For instance, an alkene and an alkyne. Let's say, ethylene and acetylene. But hydrogenation of ethylene gives ethane, and acetylene gives ethane as well. But if Z is cyclohexane, then maybe the compounds are more complex. Alternatively, let's consider that X is a mixture of two different types of cyclohexene derivatives. For example, cyclohexene and methylcyclohexene. Hydrogenation of cyclohexene is cyclohexane. Hydrogenation of methylcyclohexene is also cyclohexane (since the double bond is between two CH2 groups). Wait, but methylcyclohexene would become cyclohexane only if the methyl group is axial and the hydrogenation breaks the cyclohexene ring? No, actually, methylcyclohexene (say, 1-methylcyclohexene) hydrogenated would become methylcyclohexane, but if there's some isomerization, maybe it becomes cyclohexane. Wait, no. For example, if you have 1-methylcyclohexene, adding H2 would give 1-methylcyclohexane, which is not the same as cyclohexane. Therefore, unless there's some rearrangement, which isn't typical in hydrogenation. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the original compounds in X are such that when they disproportionate, they form cyclohexane and another compound. For example, two molecules of cyclohexene could react to form something? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is about benzene and cyclohexane. Wait, but benzene has 7.7% hydrogen, which doesn't match. Alternatively, let's think about what kind of reaction would lead to disproportionation in hydrocarbons. For example, in the presence of a catalyst like platinum and heat, alkenes can undergo polymerization, but that would form higher molecules. Alternatively, in the case of alkynes, they can undergo reactions to form alkanes and alkynes. For example, the reaction: 2 RC≡CH → RC=CH2 + RCH2CH3. But I'm not sure. Wait, if X is a mixture of two alkenes, say, 1-hexene and another alkene, when heated with platinum, which can cause isomerization. For example, 1-hexene can isomerize to 3-methylpentene-2. But that's not a disproportionation. Disproportionation usually requires different products. Alternatively, if X is a mixture of two different aldehydes, but the problem specifies hydrocarbons. Hmm. Wait, if we consider that cyclohexane is formed by hydrogenation from mixture X and Y. So, mixture X is unsaturated hydrocarbons (alkenes or alkynes) that hydrogenate to cyclohexane, and mixture Y is also hydrocarbons that hydrogenate to cyclohexane. But mixture Y is formed by disproportionation of X. Disproportionation typically involves the same reactant forming products of higher and lower oxidation states. So, perhaps in X, you have two different alkenes. For example, if X is cyclohexene and another alkene, then under certain conditions, they could react to form cyclohexane (by hydrogenation?) and another product. But I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, think about the fact that X has two liquids with isolated double bonds. For instance, X could be a mixture of two different dienes, but no conjugated dienes. Wait, but cyclohexane is formed by hydrogenation, so if X is a diene, hydrogenation would add two Hs. For example, 1,4-hexadiene would hydrogenate to hexane, but cyclohexane would require a cyclic structure. Alternatively, if X is a mixture of two different cycloalkenes. For example, two different cyclohexenes (like 1-cyclohexene and another isomer). Upon hydrogenation, both would become cyclohexane. But then Y would be something else. Wait, but the problem says that Y is formed by disproportionation of X, not hydrogenation. So maybe the platinum and heat cause a different reaction. Wait, another thought. The decolorization of bromine water indicates the presence of double or triple bonds. So X has unsaturated hydrocarbons. When treated with Pt and heat, they disproportionate. Disproportionation often involves the same reactant forming products of different oxidation states. For example, in the reaction of 2-hexyne to give hexane and 3-hexyne (a dismutation reaction), but that's under different conditions. Alternatively, if X is a mixture of two alkenes, say, 1-hexene and another alkene, and when heated over platinum, they undergo isomerization and possibly other reactions. But I'm not making progress. Let's try another approach. We need the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of X. Let's consider that each compound in X is a hydrocarbon. Let's assume each has 'n' and 'm' hydrogens. The problem asks for n + m. Given the answer choices are 12, 18, 16, 22. Let's think about possible structures. If Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), which has 12 hydrogens, then the unsaturated compounds in X would have fewer hydrogens. Wait, but when X is hydrogenated, it becomes Z. So each component of X would gain hydrogen atoms to become cyclohexane. Suppose each component of X is a cyclohexene (C6H10), which upon hydrogenation adds two hydrogens to become cyclohexane (C6H12). So if X is two moles of cyclohexene, then total H would be 10 +10=20. But answer choices don't have this. Alternatively, maybe X is a mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and another compound, say 1,3-cyclohexadiene (C6H8), which would hydrogenate to cyclohexane. But 1,3-cyclohexadiene has conjugated double bonds, which is not allowed in X. So maybe another structure. If the other compound is two isolated double bonds, like in bicyclo structures. Wait, but getting complicated. Alternatively, maybe X is a mixture of two different compounds, each with one double bond and some rings. For instance, two different cyclohexene isomers. Each would have 10 hydrogens. So total H in X would be 10+10=20. But answer choices don't have 20. Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of benzene and another compound. Wait, but benzene doesn't decolorize bromine water. Maybe only in presence of Fe. Hmm. Wait, maybe the components of X are cyclopentene and cycloheptene. Then upon hydrogenation, they become cyclopentane and cycloheptane, but these are different from cyclohexane. So Z would not be cyclohexane in that case. But the problem states that Z is a constituent of Y and is a widely used solvent. Cyclohexane is a common solvent. Another possibility is that Z is toluene? But toluene has a different hydrogen percentage. (C7H8: 8/92 ≈ 8.7%). No. Wait back to the beginning. If Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), then each H in the hydrogenated product comes either from the original compound or from added H2. If X is a mixture of two cyclic alkenes, each with one double bond. For example, two different cyclohexene isomers. Each would have molecular formula C6H10. Then, upon hydrogenation (adding one H2 per double bond), they become C6H12 (cyclohexane). So, if X is two C6H10 compounds, total H is 10+10=20. But the answer choices don't have 20. Wait, but the problem says that "the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X". If each liquid in X is C6H10, then two liquids would have C6H10 each, so total H is 10+10=20. Not in options. Alternatively, maybe X is a mixture of two different compounds, each with 6 and 10 hydrogens. But that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the original compounds in X are not cyclohexene. Maybe they have more double bonds. For instance, if X is a mixture of two conjugated dienes, but the problem states no conjugated multiple bonds. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe X is a mixture of two alkenes and an alkyne? Wait, but three components contradicts the problem. The problem states X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. Alternatively, maybe the answer is 16. Let's see how. Suppose each compound in X has 8 hydrogens. But two compounds would have 16. But how. If Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), then each component of X, when hydrogenated, must add enough H2 to reach C6H12. For example, if a component of X is C6H8, then it would need 2 H2 to become C6H12. But if X is two C6H8 compounds, then total H would be 8+8=16. But C6H8 would be a diene. If it's a diene with isolated double bonds (not conjugated), then okay. But when you hydrogenate a diene (even isolated), you would add two H2, so C6H8 + 2 H2 → C6H12. So if X is two C6H8 compounds, then the total H is 8+8=16. Then the answer is 16, option C. But does this fit? Let's check. If the two liquids in X are each C6H8 (isolated dienes), then Y would be formed by their disproportionation. Disproportionation could lead to one being reduced and another oxidized. But how? Alternatively, maybe during the reaction, some H2 is released or consumed. Wait, but the problem says that when treated with platinum when heated, disproportionation occurs. If the dienes decolorize bromine, then they could undergo a reaction where one molecule loses a double bond (becomes more reduced, cyclohexane) and another gains a double bond (oxidized, more unsaturated), but the problem says Y does not decolorize bromine. So all products in Y are saturated. That implies both products in Y are saturated. If X is C6H8 (a diene) and upon disproportionation, forms Y which is cyclohexane (C6H12) and another saturated compound. But how? Alternatively, maybe two C6H8 molecules react to form one C6H12 (cyclohexane) and another product. Let's see: 2 C6H8 → C6H12 + ? To balance, another product would need to be C6H4, but that would be highly unsaturated and would decolorize bromine. But the problem says Y doesn't decolorize. So maybe that path is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the other product is C6H12 as well. Then Y is a mixture of two C6H12 compounds. But that seems unlikely to be called disproportionation. Disproportionation usually gives different products. Alternatively, think about the fact that Z is a constituent of Y. So Y contains Z (cyclohexane) and another compound. If X is a mixture of two C6H8 dienes, then upon some reaction (not hydrogenation, but disproportionation), maybe they form cyclohexane and another saturated compound. For instance, maybe two dienes (C6H8) react to form cyclohexane (C6H12) and another hydrocarbon. Let's balance: C6H8 + C6H8 → C6H12 + C6H4? But C6H4 would be very unsaturated. Not possible. Alternatively, maybe a dimer forms. For example, two C6H8 units combining to form a larger alkane. But that's not disproportionation. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a cyclization. For instance, if X is a mixture of two alkenes, one of which can donate H2 to another. But this is unclear. Alternatively, think about 1,2-dihydroxyethylene reacting, but that's not a hydrocarbon. Wait, stepping back. If Z is cyclohexane, and mixture Y contains cyclohexane and another saturated compound. When Y is hydrogenated, the other compound becomes cyclohexane. Therefore, the other compound must be something that can hydrogenate to cyclohexane. For example, methylcyclohexene. If Y is cyclohexane and methylcyclohexene, then hydrogenating methylcyclohexene would give cyclohexane. Therefore, hydrogenation of Y (mixture of cyclohexane and methylcyclohexene) would give a mixture of cyclohexane and cyclohexane, i.e., pure cyclohexane. But how is methylcyclohexene formed? If X is a mixture of two compounds that form cyclohexane and methylcyclohexene upon some reaction. But what reaction would that be? Alternatively, if X is a mixture of cyclohexene and another compound. For example, if X is cyclohexene and methylcyclohexene. But then Y would be formed by their disproportionation. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the problem is about the total number of hydrogens in X. Let's see: If X is a mixture of two C6H10 compounds (each with 10 hydrogens), total H is 20. Not in options. If X is a mixture of C6H8 and C6H12. Then total H is 8 +12=20. No. If X is C6H12 (cyclohexane) and something else, but cyclohexane is Z, which is a product after hydrogenation. Wait, no. X is before hydrogenation. So X must be unsaturated. Hmm. Wait, maybe the answer is 16. If each compound in X has 8 hydrogens. For example, if X is a mixture of two C6H8 compounds (like 1,4-hexadiene). Each has 8 hydrogens. Total H is 16. Then upon hydrogenation (adding 2 H2 per double bond; since it's an equimolar mix, each mole would require 2 H2 to become C6H12). So hydrogenation would add 2 H2 to each double bond. Each C6H8 has two double bonds. Therefore, adding 2 H2 per double bond (two double bonds would require 4 H2), but I think hydrogenation typically adds one H2 per double bond. Wait, no. Alkenes add one H2 each. If a compound has two double bonds, it would add two H2 molecules. So C6H8 (with two double bonds) hydrogenates to C6H12 (adding two H2). So if X is two C6H8 compounds, they hydrogenate to two C6H12 (cyclohexane). But the problem says hydrogenation of X and Y gives only one substance, Z. So maybe Z is not cyclohexane but something else. Wait, but earlier calculation suggested Z is cyclohexane. Alternatively, maybe the problem is about a different set of compounds. Wait, let's check again the hydrogen percentage. If Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), mass of H is 12, mass of C is 72. Total mass is 84. Mass % H is (12/84)*100 ≈ 14.28%, which matches. So Z is cyclohexane. Then, X must be a mixture of two unsaturated hydrocarbons that hydrogenate to cyclohexane. Each component of X could be a cyclohexene (C6H10), which upon adding one H2 becomes cyclohexane (C6H12). If X is two moles of cyclohexene, then total H in X is 10 +10 =20. But answer options don't have 20. So this approach must be wrong. Wait, perhaps the components of X are not cyclohexene but something else. For example, methylidenecyclohexane (C7H12)? But no, because then hydrogenation would give a different product. Alternatively, let's think of two different compounds in X, each contributing to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. Suppose X is a mixture of cyclohexadiene (two isolated double bonds, so C6H8) and cyclohexene (C6H10). Then, upon hydrogenation, each would add H2: cyclohexadiene would add two H2 (need 2 H2 per molecule) and cyclohexene would add one H2. But the problem states that after hydrogenation, both components of X become Z, which is cyclohexane. So cyclohexadiene (C6H8) would need two H2 to become cyclohexane (C6H12), and cyclohexene (C6H10) needs one H2. But the problem says that the hydrogenation is done under severe conditions, so maybe even if there are multiple double bonds, they can all be hydrogenated. But if X is a mixture of C6H8 and C6H10, then total H in X would be 8 +10=18. If they are equimolar, then total H per mole of X (which is two moles, one of each) would be 18. But the question says "the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X". Each liquid in X is a component, so if each component is C6H8 and C6H10, then total H is 8 +10=18. But answer choice B is 18. But the problem states that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X. If cyclohexadi

okay, let's tackle this problem step by step.
it's a bit complex, but i'll try to break it down.
the problem involves an equimolar mixture x of two liquids that decolorize bromine water.
when treated with platinum and heat, they undergo disproportionation to form mixture y, which doesn't decolorize bromine water.
both x and y, when hydrogenated with platinum under severe conditions, produce the same hydrocarbon z.
z has a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28% and is a constituent of y.
also, z doesn't react further with hydrogen, and there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the compounds of x.
we need to find the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture x.
first, let's parse the key information:
1. **mixture x**: equimolar, two liquids, decolorize bromine water (indicating presence of double bonds or other reactive groups like conjugated dienes or triple bonds).
2. **disproportionation with pt heat**: forms mixture y (also equimolar, two other liquids) which doesn't decolorize bromine water.
3. **hydrogenation of x and y**: both lead to the same hydrocarbon z.
4. **hydrocarbon z**: mass % h is 14.28%, a constituent of y, used as a solvent, doesn't react further with h2 (saturated), no conjugated bonds in x.
the question is the total number of h atoms in the two liquids of x.
let's start by figuring out what hydrocarbon z is.
since z is a constituent of y and is a solvent, widely used, and has 14.28% hydrogen by mass.
let's calculate the empirical formula for z.
hydrocarbon z: h% = 14.28%, so c% = 100 - 14.28 = 85.72%.
assume 100 g of z: 85.72 g c, 14.28 g h.
convert to moles:
c: 85.72 / 12 ≈ 7.143 moles
h: 14.28 / 1 ≈ 14.28 moles
divide by smallest number:
c: 7.143 / 7.143 ≈ 1
h: 14.28 / 7.143 ≈ 2
so empirical formula is ch2.
so the hydrocarbon is likely ethylene (c2h4)? but wait, z is saturated (doesn't react with h2), so ethylene (c2h4) is unsaturated.
wait, that can't be. wait, maybe i miscalculated. wait, if the empirical formula is ch2, possible hydrocarbons are c2h4, c3h6, etc. but z is saturated? because it doesn't react further with h2. wait, that's confusing. wait, if z is the product of hydrogenation, then z should be saturated. but if the empirical formula is ch2, that suggests it's an alkene (cnh2n). but alkenes would require hydrogenation, so if z is the product, then maybe it's an alkane? wait, the problem says hydrogenation of x and y gives z. so x and y are unsaturated, and z is saturated. so z should have the formula cnh2n+2. but the empirical formula based on mass % is ch2. so perhaps z is an alkane? let me check. if z is an alkane cnh2n+2, then the mass % h is (2n+2)/(12n + 2n +2)*100. we are given that as 14.28%, so let's compute: (2n + 2)/(14n + 2) = 14.28/100 = 0.1428.
so, (2n + 2)/(14n + 2) = 0.1428.
multiply both sides by (14n + 2):
2n + 2 = 0.1428*(14n + 2)
let me compute rhs:
0.1428*(14n + 2) = 0.1428*14n + 0.1428*2 ≈ 2.0n + 0.2856
so:
2n + 2 ≈ 2.0n + 0.2856
subtract 2n from both sides:
2 ≈ 0.2856
which is not possible. so clearly, this approach is wrong. perhaps z isn't an alkane. wait, maybe i made a mistake in assuming the formula. let's approach again. let me recompute the empirical formula: given h% = 14.28%, so in 100g of z, h = 14.28g, c = 85.72g.
moles of c: 85.72 / 12 ≈ 7.143
moles of h: 14.28 / 1 ≈ 14.28
mole ratio: c:h ≈ 1:2, so empirical formula is ch2.
therefore, the molecular formula must be (ch2)n.
now, since z is a hydrocarbon and the empirical formula is ch2, possible candidates are ethylene (c2h4), cyclohexane (c6h12), etc. but z is a solvent and widely used. also, z is a constituent of y, which is formed by disproportionation of x. also, x's components have no conjugated double bonds. hmm. disproportionation usually involves a reaction where the same molecule is both oxidized and reduced. for example, in the case of aldehydes forming acids and alcohols, but here we are dealing with hydrocarbons. wait, another example is the disproportionation of 2-hexyne to hexane and 3-hexyne under certain conditions. but i'm not sure. alternatively, think about the fact that mixture y doesn't decolorize bromine water, so the products are saturated. since x decolorizes bromine (i.e., has double bonds or triple bonds), when they disproportionate, they form a mixture of saturated compounds (maybe one with longer chains or different structures). but after hydrogenation, both x and y become z, which is a saturated hydrocarbon. since z is a constituent of y, that means y has z and another compound. but when y is hydrogenated, it becomes z. that suggests that the other compound in y is an unsaturated hydrocarbon which, upon hydrogenation, becomes z as well. wait, but if y is the product of disproportionation, then maybe the two components of y are z and another compound which, upon hydrogenation, also gives z. that would mean the other compound in y is an isomer of z that can hydrogenate to z, but that seems odd. alternatively, maybe during hydrogenation, some structural rearrangement happens, but usually hydrogenation is supposed to be selective. wait, but the problem states that both mixture x and mixture y hydrogenate to give only one substance, z. so both components of x hydrogenate to z, and both components of y hydrogenate to z. therefore, z must be a saturated hydrocarbon that can be formed both by hydrogenating the components of x (which are unsaturated) and by hydrogenating the components of y (which might be a mixture of a saturated and an unsaturated compound, but the problem says both components of y hydrogenate to z). wait, but mixture y is said to be an equimolar mixture of two liquids, which do not decolorize bromine water (so they are saturated). therefore, both components of y are saturated compounds, which when hydrogenated (even though they are already saturated) don't react further, but maybe they isomerize? but the problem says "no further reaction with hydrogen" for z. wait, but if y's components are saturated, then hydrogenation would not do anything. but the problem says that hydrogenation of y gives z. so perhaps y's components are cyclic or have some functional groups that can be hydrogenated? wait, but if they don't decolorize bromine, they must be saturated. alternatively, maybe y's components are aldehydes or something else, but the problem specifies hydrocarbons. wait, the problem states that "hydrogenation of both mixture x and mixture y in the presence of platinum under rather severe conditions gives only one substance, a certain hydrocarbon z..." so, even though y's components might be saturated, they undergo some reaction under severe conditions. but normally, severe conditions with h2 and pt might indicate isomerization or something else, but the problem states it's hydrogenation. wait, maybe the components of y are conjugated dienes, but then they would decolorize bromine water. but the problem says y does not decolorize. alternatively, maybe the components of y are more substituted alkenes that are harder to hydrogenate, but the question says after treatment with pt and heat, they don't decolorize bromine. hmm. alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not simple hydrogenation but some other type of reaction. wait, but the problem statement says "hydrogenation of both mixture x and mixture y...". let's pause. let's think of possible hydrocarbons z that are solvents. common hydrocarbon solvents are things like hexane, benzene (though it's not an alkane), but benzene would have 7.7% hydrogen. wait, hexane (c6h14) has mass % h: (14 / 86) * 100 ≈ 16.28%. the given value is 14.28%. let's check pentane (c5h12): (12 / 72) *100 ≈ 16.66%. not matching. heptane (c7h16): 16 / 100 *approx*, no. maybe something else. wait, cyclohexane: c6h12. mass % h: 12 / 84 ≈ 14.28%. yes! 12 hydrogen / (6*12 + 12*1) = 12/84 ≈ 0.142857, which is 14.28%. so cyclohexane (c6h12) is a possible candidate for z. cyclohexane is a common solvent, and 14.28% h matches. so z is cyclohexane. then, mixture y contains cyclohexane and another compound. since y is formed by disproportionation of x, which is an equimolar mixture of two liquids with double bonds (since they decolorize bromine water). disproportionation often involves the same compound forming products of different oxidation states. for example, in the case of 2-hexyne, under certain conditions, it can disproportionate into hexane and 3-hexyne. but here, maybe the reactants are conjugated dienes. wait, but the problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds in x. so perhaps x has isolated double bonds or isolated triple bonds. wait, if z is cyclohexane, then hydrogenation of x (which are unsaturated compounds) would lead to cyclohexane. so the components of x must be cyclohexene or something that becomes cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. wait, but cyclohexene hydrogenated is cyclohexane. so if x is cyclohexene, but cyclohexene has a single double bond, so adding h2 would give cyclohexane. but if x is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, perhaps cyclohexene and something else? wait, but cyclohexane is a constituent of y, which is formed by disproportionation of x. disproportionation usually requires a reactant that can form products of different oxidation states. if x is a single compound, but here x is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. wait, maybe the problem is about the oxidation of one molecule and reduction of another. wait, perhaps the liquids in x are such that when heated with platinum, one undergoes oxidation (forming a more oxidized product) and the other reduction (more reduced product). for example, if x is a mixture of an alkene and an alkyne. let's say, for example, x is an alkene and another alkene. wait, but how would that disproportionate? alternatively, maybe x contains a diene and an alkene. but the problem says no conjugated multiple bonds. hmm. wait, if z is cyclohexane, and y is a mixture of cyclohexane and another compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane. let's say, for example, y is cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane. but when you hydrogenate methylcyclohexane, you get cyclohexane. but if that's the case, then x must be something that forms cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane upon some reaction. but the problem states that x is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. let's think: if x is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexene and another compound, say a conjugated diene... wait, but cyclohexene has one double bond. if you mix it with another compound, maybe with two double bonds, then under certain conditions, they could react to form cyclohexane and another product. but i'm getting stuck here. alternatively, let's think about the fact that the problem mentions "disproportionation". disproportionation typically involves a species that is both oxidized and reduced. for example, 2 hocl → hcl + hclo2. in organic chemistry, a ketone can disproportionate to give alcohol and aldehyde under certain conditions. but in this case, maybe a dihalide? wait, maybe the liquids in x are halogenated hydrocarbons? but the problem states they decolorize bromine water. normally, alkenes and dienes react with bromine to decolorize bromine water. so x likely consists of alkenes or dienes. upon treatment with pt and heat, they might undergo some type of reaction. wait, another thought: the reaction of alkenes with platinum under heat can lead to hydrogenation or possibly isomerization. but if it's hydrogenation, then the product would be alkanes. but in the problem, the products y still have two liquids. if x is an alkene and a diene, then hydrogenation would give alkanes, but the problem says y doesn't decolorize bromine, so they must be saturated. but if y is formed by hydrogenation, then why would further hydrogenation of y give z? unless the conditions are different. wait, maybe the first reaction is not full hydrogenation. wait, the problem says that when treated with platinum when heated, x becomes y through disproportionation, not necessarily hydrogenation. then, separately, both x and y when hydrogenated with platinum under severe conditions give z. so maybe the initial reaction (disproportionation) doesn't involve h2, just heating with pt. for example, certain alkenes can undergo ring formation or other reactions. wait, for instance, if x is a mixture of two alkenes, say 1-hexene and another alkene. upon heating with platinum, which can act as an acid and cause rearrangements. but i'm not familiar with such a reaction. alternatively, maybe the alkenes undergo a [2+4] cycloaddition, but that would require specific conditions and might not be disproportionation. alternatively, think about allene. however, allene is a triply bonded compound, but it also decolorizes bromine water. if x is allene and another compound, but i'm not sure. wait, the problem says that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in x. so any double bonds in x are isolated. so, if x has two liquids with isolated double bonds, and when heated with platinum, they might undergo some type of reaction. for example, if one of the compounds in x has a triple bond (since triple bonds are more reactive), but triple bonds are also isolated, maybe. wait, but triple bonds can decolorize bromine as well. wait, let's think about acetylene vs. allene. acetylene is a triple bond, allene is two double bonds, but in allene, they are not conjugated (if it's something like ch2=ch-ch=ch2?), but the problem says no conjugated bonds. wait, allene is ch2=c=ch2, which has a triple bond equivalent, but actually, it's two double bonds with a carbon atom in between. wait, allene (ch2=c=ch2) has a cumulated double bond, but cumulated double bonds are not conjugated because there's no alternating single and double bonds. wait, but cumulated double bonds are typically in a straight line and not conjugated. however, allene (ch2=c=ch2) can react with bromine. alternatively, maybe the compounds in x are such that when heated over platinum, they undergo ozonolysis or something else. but ozonolysis requires o3, not h2. hmm. another angle: the fact that z is cyclohexane (assuming 14.28% h is cyclohexane). then, what would x be? if x is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that hydrogenate to cyclohexane. so, possible x components could be cyclohexene and another compound that upon hydrogenation becomes cyclohexane. but if x is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexene and 1,3-cyclohexadiene, then hydrogenation would convert both to cyclohexane. but 1,3-cyclohexadiene is a conjugated diene, but the problem says there are no conjugated multiple bonds in x. therefore, that's out. alternatively, x could be a mixture of two different cyclohexene isomers, but i don't think that would form different products upon hydrogenation. wait, if x is a mixture of two alkenes, each with three double bonds? no, that seems unlikely. wait, perhaps x is a mixture of two different compounds, each with a double bond and a triple bond? for instance, an alkene and an alkyne. let's say, ethylene and acetylene. but hydrogenation of ethylene gives ethane, and acetylene gives ethane as well. but if z is cyclohexane, then maybe the compounds are more complex. alternatively, let's consider that x is a mixture of two different types of cyclohexene derivatives. for example, cyclohexene and methylcyclohexene. hydrogenation of cyclohexene is cyclohexane. hydrogenation of methylcyclohexene is also cyclohexane (since the double bond is between two ch2 groups). wait, but methylcyclohexene would become cyclohexane only if the methyl group is axial and the hydrogenation breaks the cyclohexene ring? no, actually, methylcyclohexene (say, 1-methylcyclohexene) hydrogenated would become methylcyclohexane, but if there's some isomerization, maybe it becomes cyclohexane. wait, no. for example, if you have 1-methylcyclohexene, adding h2 would give 1-methylcyclohexane, which is not the same as cyclohexane. therefore, unless there's some rearrangement, which isn't typical in hydrogenation. hmm. alternatively, perhaps the original compounds in x are such that when they disproportionate, they form cyclohexane and another compound. for example, two molecules of cyclohexene could react to form something? not sure. alternatively, maybe the problem is about benzene and cyclohexane. wait, but benzene has 7.7% hydrogen, which doesn't match. alternatively, let's think about what kind of reaction would lead to disproportionation in hydrocarbons. for example, in the presence of a catalyst like platinum and heat, alkenes can undergo polymerization, but that would form higher molecules. alternatively, in the case of alkynes, they can undergo reactions to form alkanes and alkynes. for example, the reaction: 2 rc≡ch → rc=ch2 + rch2ch3. but i'm not sure. wait, if x is a mixture of two alkenes, say, 1-hexene and another alkene, when heated with platinum, which can cause isomerization. for example, 1-hexene can isomerize to 3-methylpentene-2. but that's not a disproportionation. disproportionation usually requires different products. alternatively, if x is a mixture of two different aldehydes, but the problem specifies hydrocarbons. hmm. wait, if we consider that cyclohexane is formed by hydrogenation from mixture x and y. so, mixture x is unsaturated hydrocarbons (alkenes or alkynes) that hydrogenate to cyclohexane, and mixture y is also hydrocarbons that hydrogenate to cyclohexane. but mixture y is formed by disproportionation of x. disproportionation typically involves the same reactant forming products of higher and lower oxidation states. so, perhaps in x, you have two different alkenes. for example, if x is cyclohexene and another alkene, then under certain conditions, they could react to form cyclohexane (by hydrogenation?) and another product. but i'm getting stuck here. alternatively, think about the fact that x has two liquids with isolated double bonds. for instance, x could be a mixture of two different dienes, but no conjugated dienes. wait, but cyclohexane is formed by hydrogenation, so if x is a diene, hydrogenation would add two hs. for example, 1,4-hexadiene would hydrogenate to hexane, but cyclohexane would require a cyclic structure. alternatively, if x is a mixture of two different cycloalkenes. for example, two different cyclohexenes (like 1-cyclohexene and another isomer). upon hydrogenation, both would become cyclohexane. but then y would be something else. wait, but the problem says that y is formed by disproportionation of x, not hydrogenation. so maybe the platinum and heat cause a different reaction. wait, another thought. the decolorization of bromine water indicates the presence of double or triple bonds. so x has unsaturated hydrocarbons. when treated with pt and heat, they disproportionate. disproportionation often involves the same reactant forming products of different oxidation states. for example, in the reaction of 2-hexyne to give hexane and 3-hexyne (a dismutation reaction), but that's under different conditions. alternatively, if x is a mixture of two alkenes, say, 1-hexene and another alkene, and when heated over platinum, they undergo isomerization and possibly other reactions. but i'm not making progress. let's try another approach. we need the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of x. let's consider that each compound in x is a hydrocarbon. let's assume each has 'n' and 'm' hydrogens. the problem asks for n + m. given the answer choices are 12, 18, 16, 22. let's think about possible structures. if z is cyclohexane (c6h12), which has 12 hydrogens, then the unsaturated compounds in x would have fewer hydrogens. wait, but when x is hydrogenated, it becomes z. so each component of x would gain hydrogen atoms to become cyclohexane. suppose each component of x is a cyclohexene (c6h10), which upon hydrogenation adds two hydrogens to become cyclohexane (c6h12). so if x is two moles of cyclohexene, then total h would be 10 +10=20. but answer choices don't have this. alternatively, maybe x is a mixture of cyclohexene (c6h10) and another compound, say 1,3-cyclohexadiene (c6h8), which would hydrogenate to cyclohexane. but 1,3-cyclohexadiene has conjugated double bonds, which is not allowed in x. so maybe another structure. if the other compound is two isolated double bonds, like in bicyclo structures. wait, but getting complicated. alternatively, maybe x is a mixture of two different compounds, each with one double bond and some rings. for instance, two different cyclohexene isomers. each would have 10 hydrogens. so total h in x would be 10+10=20. but answer choices don't have 20. alternatively, perhaps x is a mixture of benzene and another compound. wait, but benzene doesn't decolorize bromine water. maybe only in presence of fe. hmm. wait, maybe the components of x are cyclopentene and cycloheptene. then upon hydrogenation, they become cyclopentane and cycloheptane, but these are different from cyclohexane. so z would not be cyclohexane in that case. but the problem states that z is a constituent of y and is a widely used solvent. cyclohexane is a common solvent. another possibility is that z is toluene? but toluene has a different hydrogen percentage. (c7h8: 8/92 ≈ 8.7%). no. wait back to the beginning. if z is cyclohexane (c6h12), then each h in the hydrogenated product comes either from the original compound or from added h2. if x is a mixture of two cyclic alkenes, each with one double bond. for example, two different cyclohexene isomers. each would have molecular formula c6h10. then, upon hydrogenation (adding one h2 per double bond), they become c6h12 (cyclohexane). so, if x is two c6h10 compounds, total h is 10+10=20. but the answer choices don't have 20. wait, but the problem says that "the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture x". if each liquid in x is c6h10, then two liquids would have c6h10 each, so total h is 10+10=20. not in options. alternatively, maybe x is a mixture of two different compounds, each with 6 and 10 hydrogens. but that doesn't make sense. wait, maybe the original compounds in x are not cyclohexene. maybe they have more double bonds. for instance, if x is a mixture of two conjugated dienes, but the problem states no conjugated multiple bonds. hmm. alternatively, maybe x is a mixture of two alkenes and an alkyne? wait, but three components contradicts the problem. the problem states x is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. alternatively, maybe the answer is 16. let's see how. suppose each compound in x has 8 hydrogens. but two compounds would have 16. but how. if z is cyclohexane (c6h12), then each component of x, when hydrogenated, must add enough h2 to reach c6h12. for example, if a component of x is c6h8, then it would need 2 h2 to become c6h12. but if x is two c6h8 compounds, then total h would be 8+8=16. but c6h8 would be a diene. if it's a diene with isolated double bonds (not conjugated), then okay. but when you hydrogenate a diene (even isolated), you would add two h2, so c6h8 + 2 h2 → c6h12. so if x is two c6h8 compounds, then the total h is 8+8=16. then the answer is 16, option c. but does this fit? let's check. if the two liquids in x are each c6h8 (isolated dienes), then y would be formed by their disproportionation. disproportionation could lead to one being reduced and another oxidized. but how? alternatively, maybe during the reaction, some h2 is released or consumed. wait, but the problem says that when treated with platinum when heated, disproportionation occurs. if the dienes decolorize bromine, then they could undergo a reaction where one molecule loses a double bond (becomes more reduced, cyclohexane) and another gains a double bond (oxidized, more unsaturated), but the problem says y does not decolorize bromine. so all products in y are saturated. that implies both products in y are saturated. if x is c6h8 (a diene) and upon disproportionation, forms y which is cyclohexane (c6h12) and another saturated compound. but how? alternatively, maybe two c6h8 molecules react to form one c6h12 (cyclohexane) and another product. let's see: 2 c6h8 → c6h12 + ? to balance, another product would need to be c6h4, but that would be highly unsaturated and would decolorize bromine. but the problem says y doesn't decolorize. so maybe that path is incorrect. alternatively, maybe the other product is c6h12 as well. then y is a mixture of two c6h12 compounds. but that seems unlikely to be called disproportionation. disproportionation usually gives different products. alternatively, think about the fact that z is a constituent of y. so y contains z (cyclohexane) and another compound. if x is a mixture of two c6h8 dienes, then upon some reaction (not hydrogenation, but disproportionation), maybe they form cyclohexane and another saturated compound. for instance, maybe two dienes (c6h8) react to form cyclohexane (c6h12) and another hydrocarbon. let's balance: c6h8 + c6h8 → c6h12 + c6h4? but c6h4 would be very unsaturated. not possible. alternatively, maybe a dimer forms. for example, two c6h8 units combining to form a larger alkane. but that's not disproportionation. alternatively, maybe the reaction is a cyclization. for instance, if x is a mixture of two alkenes, one of which can donate h2 to another. but this is unclear. alternatively, think about 1,2-dihydroxyethylene reacting, but that's not a hydrocarbon. wait, stepping back. if z is cyclohexane, and mixture y contains cyclohexane and another saturated compound. when y is hydrogenated, the other compound becomes cyclohexane. therefore, the other compound must be something that can hydrogenate to cyclohexane. for example, methylcyclohexene. if y is cyclohexane and methylcyclohexene, then hydrogenating methylcyclohexene would give cyclohexane. therefore, hydrogenation of y (mixture of cyclohexane and methylcyclohexene) would give a mixture of cyclohexane and cyclohexane, i.e., pure cyclohexane. but how is methylcyclohexene formed? if x is a mixture of two compounds that form cyclohexane and methylcyclohexene upon some reaction. but what reaction would that be? alternatively, if x is a mixture of cyclohexene and another compound. for example, if x is cyclohexene and methylcyclohexene. but then y would be formed by their disproportionation. hmm. alternatively, maybe the problem is about the total number of hydrogens in x. let's see: if x is a mixture of two c6h10 compounds (each with 10 hydrogens), total h is 20. not in options. if x is a mixture of c6h8 and c6h12. then total h is 8 +12=20. no. if x is c6h12 (cyclohexane) and something else, but cyclohexane is z, which is a product after hydrogenation. wait, no. x is before hydrogenation. so x must be unsaturated. hmm. wait, maybe the answer is 16. if each compound in x has 8 hydrogens. for example, if x is a mixture of two c6h8 compounds (like 1,4-hexadiene). each has 8 hydrogens. total h is 16. then upon hydrogenation (adding 2 h2 per double bond; since it's an equimolar mix, each mole would require 2 h2 to become c6h12). so hydrogenation would add 2 h2 to each double bond. each c6h8 has two double bonds. therefore, adding 2 h2 per double bond (two double bonds would require 4 h2), but i think hydrogenation typically adds one h2 per double bond. wait, no. alkenes add one h2 each. if a compound has two double bonds, it would add two h2 molecules. so c6h8 (with two double bonds) hydrogenates to c6h12 (adding two h2). so if x is two c6h8 compounds, they hydrogenate to two c6h12 (cyclohexane). but the problem says hydrogenation of x and y gives only one substance, z. so maybe z is not cyclohexane but something else. wait, but earlier calculation suggested z is cyclohexane. alternatively, maybe the problem is about a different set of compounds. wait, let's check again the hydrogen percentage. if z is cyclohexane (c6h12), mass of h is 12, mass of c is 72. total mass is 84. mass % h is (12/84)*100 ≈ 14.28%, which matches. so z is cyclohexane. then, x must be a mixture of two unsaturated hydrocarbons that hydrogenate to cyclohexane. each component of x could be a cyclohexene (c6h10), which upon adding one h2 becomes cyclohexane (c6h12). if x is two moles of cyclohexene, then total h in x is 10 +10 =20. but answer options don't have 20. so this approach must be wrong. wait, perhaps the components of x are not cyclohexene but something else. for example, methylidenecyclohexane (c7h12)? but no, because then hydrogenation would give a different product. alternatively, let's think of two different compounds in x, each contributing to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. suppose x is a mixture of cyclohexadiene (two isolated double bonds, so c6h8) and cyclohexene (c6h10). then, upon hydrogenation, each would add h2: cyclohexadiene would add two h2 (need 2 h2 per molecule) and cyclohexene would add one h2. but the problem states that after hydrogenation, both components of x become z, which is cyclohexane. so cyclohexadiene (c6h8) would need two h2 to become cyclohexane (c6h12), and cyclohexene (c6h10) needs one h2. but the problem says that the hydrogenation is done under severe conditions, so maybe even if there are multiple double bonds, they can all be hydrogenated. but if x is a mixture of c6h8 and c6h10, then total h in x would be 8 +10=18. if they are equimolar, then total h per mole of x (which is two moles, one of each) would be 18. but the question says "the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture x". each liquid in x is a component, so if each component is c6h8 and c6h10, then total h is 8 +10=18. but answer choice b is 18. but the problem states that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in x. if cyclohexadi
