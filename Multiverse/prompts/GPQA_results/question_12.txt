Okay, so I need to find the kinetic energies of the product particles in the decay of a pi-plus meson into a muon and a neutrino. The problem states that the pi-plus is stationary, which means the muon and neutrino will have opposite momenta to conserve momentum. The rest masses are given as 139.6 MeV/c2 for the pi-plus and 105.7 MeV/c2 for the muon. The neutrino is massless, I think? Well, the problem doesn't give a rest mass for the neutrino, so maybe it's assumed to be massless. That would make sense because neutrinos have very small masses, and in many problems, they are approximated as massless particles, like photons. So, the neutrino is like a photon in terms of having energy and momentum but no rest mass. Okay, so the decay is pi-plus at rest decaying into a muon and a neutrino. This is similar to a charged pion decay, right? So, I need to use conservation of energy and momentum. Since the pi-plus is at rest, the total momentum before the decay is zero. Therefore, the total momentum after the decay must also be zero. That means the momentum of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So, their momenta are equal but opposite, so their magnitudes are the same. So, if I denote the momentum of the muon as p, then the momentum of the neutrino is also p, but in the opposite direction. Now, energy and momentum are related for each particle. For the muon, since it's a massive particle, its energy (E_mu) is given by sqrt((pc)^2 + (m_mu c2)^2). Similarly, for the neutrino, since it's massless, its energy (E_nu) is just pc. The total energy before the decay is just the rest energy of the pi-plus, which is m_pi c2. So, 139.6 MeV. After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the muon's energy and the neutrino's energy. So, we have: m_pi c2 = E_mu + E_nu But E_mu = sqrt((p^2 c^2) + (m_mu^2 c^4)) E_nu = p c Therefore, 139.6 MeV = sqrt((p^2 c^2) + (105.7^2 c^4 / c^2)) + p c Wait, the units here are a bit confusing, but since we're working in natural units where c=1, this simplifies. Maybe I should set c=1 to make the calculations easier. So, in natural units (where c=1), the energy and mass are equivalent. So, m_pi = 139.6 MeV, m_mu = 105.7 MeV, and the neutrino mass is 0. So, the equation becomes: m_pi = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p So, 139.6 = sqrt(p^2 + 105.7^2) + p This equation can be solved for p. Let me rearrange it. Subtract p from both sides: 139.6 - p = sqrt(p^2 + 105.7^2) Now, square both sides: (139.6 - p)^2 = p^2 + 105.7^2 Expand the left side: 139.6^2 - 2*139.6*p + p^2 = p^2 + 105.7^2 Subtract p^2 from both sides: 139.6^2 - 2*139.6*p = 105.7^2 Then, move 105.7^2 to the left: 139.6^2 - 105.7^2 - 2*139.6*p = 0 Factor the difference of squares: (139.6 - 105.7)(139.6 + 105.7) - 2*139.6*p = 0 Calculate each term: 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 139.6 + 105.7 = 245.3 So, 33.9 * 245.3 - 2*139.6*p = 0 Calculate 33.9 * 245.3. Let me compute that. First, 30 * 245.3 = 7359 3.9 * 245.3 = 956.67 So, total is 7359 + 956.67 ≈ 8315.67 Therefore, 8315.67 - 2*139.6*p = 0 So, 2*139.6*p = 8315.67 => p = 8315.67 / (2*139.6) Calculate denominator: 2*139.6 = 279.2 So, p = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ Let me compute that. 279.2 * 30 ≈ 8376, which is a bit more than 8315.67. So, 30 - (8376 - 8315.67)/279.2 ≈ 30 - 60.33/279.2 ≈ 30 - 0.216 ≈ 29.784 So, approximately p ≈ 29.78 MeV/c. So, the momentum p is approximately 29.78 MeV/c. Now, the kinetic energy of the muon is E_mu - m_mu. So, first find E_mu which is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2). But wait, earlier we set c=1, so E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2). But actually, in natural units, E_mu would be in units of mass (MeV/c2), but since we've already been working in units where c=1, maybe everything is in MeV. Wait, perhaps the masses are given in MeV, which actually is equivalent to MeV/c2 when talking about rest mass. So perhaps in this problem, they just use MeV as the mass. So, m_pi is 139.6 MeV, which actually should be m_pi c2 = 139.6 MeV, so m_pi = 139.6 MeV/c2. But when we calculate the energy E_mu in natural units (where c=1), it's E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2). But then, the energy in MeV would be E_mu * c2? Wait, this might be getting confusing. Let me clarify. Let's recall that in particle physics, it's common to use units where c = 1, so energies and rest masses can be expressed in the same units, like MeV. So, the rest mass of the pi-plus is 139.6 MeV/c2, but when c=1, that becomes 139.6 MeV. Similarly, the rest mass of the muon is 105.7 MeV/c2 becomes 105.7 MeV. The momentum p would have units of MeV/c, but with c=1, it's just MeV. Then, energy has units of MeV. So, the energy of the muon would be E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) where p is in MeV and m_mu is in MeV. Therefore, E_mu is in MeV. Then, the kinetic energy of the muon is E_mu - m_mu. Similarly, the energy of the neutrino is E_nu = p c, but with c=1, that's just p, so E_nu = p. Therefore, the total energy is m_pi c2 = E_mu + E_nu = (sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p). But since m_pi c2 = 139.6 MeV and m_mu c2 = 105.7 MeV, we have: 139.6 = sqrt(p2 + 105.72) + p Which is the same equation as before. Then, solving for p, we got approximately p ≈ 29.78 MeV (since c=1, units of p are MeV). Therefore, the energy of the neutrino E_nu = p = 29.78 MeV. The kinetic energy of the muon is E_mu - m_mu = (sqrt(p2 + m_mu2) - m_mu). Let's compute that. First, compute E_mu: E_mu = sqrt(29.782 + 105.72) 29.78 squared: approx 886.8 MeV2 105.7 squared: 105.7*105.7. 1002=10000, 100*5.7=5700, 5.72=32.49. So, 105.72 = (100+5.7)^2 = 1002 + 2*100*5.7 + 5.72 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49. So, 886.8 + 11172.49 ≈ 12059.29. So, sqrt(12059.29) ≈ 109.81 MeV. Therefore, E_mu ≈ 109.81 MeV. Then, kinetic energy of muon (KE_mu) = E_mu - m_mu = 109.81 - 105.7 ≈ 4.11 MeV. Then, KE_nu is E_nu, which is 29.78 MeV. But wait, the neutrino's energy is E_nu = p = 29.78 MeV, but since the neutrino is massless, all its energy is kinetic. Therefore, KE_nu = E_nu = 29.78 MeV. So, the kinetic energies are approximately 4.11 MeV and 29.78 MeV. Looking at the answer choices, option A is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, which is very close. But let me check my approximation to see if a more precise calculation is needed. Maybe my approximation when calculating p was a bit rough. Let me go back and compute p more accurately. Original equation: 139.6 = sqrt(p2 + 105.72) + p Rearranged: 139.6 - p = sqrt(p2 + 105.72) Squared: 139.62 - 2*139.6 p + p2 = p2 + 105.72 Simplify: 139.62 - 2*139.6 p = 105.72 Subtract: 139.62 - 105.72 = 2*139.6 p So, p = (139.62 - 105.72)/(2*139.6) Compute numerator: 139.6 + 105.7 = 245.3 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 So, (139.62 - 105.72) = (139.6 - 105.7)*(139.6 + 105.7) = 33.9 * 245.3 Calculate 33.9 * 245.3. Let me compute this more accurately. First, 33.9 * 200 = 6780 33.9 * 45 = 1525.5 33.9 * 0.3 = 10.17 Total = 6780 + 1525.5 + 10.17 = 8315.67 So numerator is 8315.67 Denominator is 2*139.6 = 279.2 Therefore, p = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ Let's compute this division. 279.2 * 29 = 279.2*30 = 8376 - 279.2 = 8376 - 279.2 = 8096.8 Wait, no. Wait 279.2 * 30 = 8376, so 279.2 * 29 = 8376 - 279.2 = 8096.8. But 8315.67 is less than 8376, so 279.2 * (29 + (8315.67 - 8096.8)/279.2) = 279.2*(29 + 218.87/279.2) 218.87 / 279.2 ≈ 0.784 So, p ≈ 29 + 0.784 ≈ 29.784 MeV So, p ≈ 29.784 MeV, which is the momentum. Then, the energy of the neutrino is E_nu = p*c, but since in our units c=1, E_nu = p = 29.784 MeV. So, the neutrino's kinetic energy is 29.784 MeV. Now, compute the muon's energy: E_mu = sqrt(p2 + m_mu2) = sqrt((29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2) Compute 29.7842: 29.784 * 29.784 ≈ (30 - 0.216)^2 ≈ 900 - 2*30*0.216 + 0.2162 ≈ 900 - 12.96 + 0.046 ≈ 887.086 MeV2 Similarly, 105.72 = 11172.49 (as computed earlier). So, E_mu = sqrt(887.086 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.576) ≈ 109.816 MeV Therefore, kinetic energy of muon is E_mu - m_mu = 109.816 - 105.7 ≈ 4.116 MeV So, approximately 4.12 MeV and 29.784 MeV. The closest answer is A) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV. So, the correct answer should be A. Wait, but let me check the other options. Wait, the options are given as: A) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV B) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV C) 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV D) 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV So, if our calculation gives 4.116 MeV and 29.78 MeV, which rounds to 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, so answer A. So, why would the other options be incorrect? Let's think. Option B has lower energies, perhaps a mistake in calculation. Option C higher. Option D in between. But our step-by-step calculation matches answer A. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Wait, but let me check if there's another approach. Let me recall that in a decay where a particle at rest decays into two particles, one massive and one massless, the energies can be calculated using the formulas: E1 = (m_parent2 c4 + m_child12 c^4)/(2 m_parent c2) and E2 = (m_parent2 c4 - m_child12 c^4)/(2 m_parent c2) Wait, perhaps these formulas are applicable here. Wait, in the case where a particle decays into two particles, one of which is massless (like a neutrino), the energies are given by E_photon = (m_parent2 - m_daughter2)/(2 m_parent) and E_daughter = (m_parent2 + m_daughter2)/(2 m_parent) Wait, let me check. In natural units where c=1, the energy of the daughter particle (muon) would be (m_pi2 + m_mu2)/(2 m_pi) and the energy of the neutrino would be (m_pi2 - m_mu2)/(2 m_pi). Then, kinetic energy of muon is E_daughter - m_mu, and KE of neutrino is E_photon since it's massless. Wait, let's try this. Compute E_mu = (m_pi2 + m_mu2)/(2 m_pi) E_nu = (m_pi2 - m_mu2)/(2 m_pi) Compute m_pi = 139.6, m_mu = 105.7 E_mu = (139.62 + 105.72)/(2*139.6) E_nu = (139.62 - 105.72)/(2*139.6) Compute numerator terms: 139.62 = 19,500.16 (since 139.6*139.6 = (140-0.4)^2 = 1402 - 2*140*0.4 +0.42=19600 -112 +0.16=19488.16, wait, but 139.6 is actually: 139.6 * 139.6: Calculate 130*130=16900, 130*9.6=1152, 9.6*130=1152, 9.6*9.6=92.16. So, total: 16900 + 1152 + 1152 + 92.16 = 16900 + 2352 + 92.16 = 19352 + 92.16 = 19444.16. Wait, no. Wait 139 * 139 = 19321. Then 139.6 = 139 + 0.6. So, (a + b)^2 = a2 + 2ab + b2. Here, a = 139, b = 0.6. So, 1392 = 19321, 2*139*0.6 = 166.8, 0.62=0.36. So total: 19321 + 166.8 + 0.36 = 19488.16. So, 139.62 = 19488.16. Similarly, 105.72 = 11172.49. Therefore: E_mu = (19488.16 + 11172.49)/(2*139.6) = (30660.65)/279.2 ≈ 109.81 MeV E_nu = (19488.16 - 11172.49)/279.2 = 8315.67/279.2 ≈ 29.78 MeV Therefore, KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu = 109.81 - 105.7 ≈ 4.11 MeV KE_nu = E_nu = 29.78 MeV, since neutrino is massless. So, this again gives the same result as before. Therefore, answer A. So, why are the other options different? Let's see option B: 2.84 and 26.8. Perhaps if there was a mistake in calculating the momentum? Wait, maybe if someone used the non-relativistic approximation, which would be way off here. But given that we're dealing with particles near the mass scale of mesons and muons, relativistic effects are significant, so non-relativistic approximation is invalid. Option C: 7.2 and 32.8. Maybe if someone added energies without considering the mass properly. Option D: 3.52 and 20.8. Maybe confused with a different problem. So, all other options seem inconsistent with the calculation. Therefore, the correct answer must be A. Wait, but let me check the KE values again. For the neutrino, since it's massless, all its energy is kinetic. So E_nu = pc = KE_nu. For the muon, KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu. So, we have the total energy: m_pi c2 = 139.6 MeV = E_mu + E_nu = (KE_mu + m_mu c2) + KE_nu = KE_mu + m_mu c2 + KE_nu. But in our case, KE_mu = 4.11 MeV, KE_nu = 29.78 MeV. So total KE: 4.11 + 29.78 = 33.89 MeV. Then, m_pi c2 - m_mu c2 = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV, which matches the total KE. So this is a good check. So, indeed, the sum of the kinetic energies is equal to the mass difference, which is consistent with conservation of energy. Therefore, answer A is correct.

Answer: To find the kinetic energies (KE) of the muon and neutrino in the decay of a stationary pi-plus meson ($\pi^+$) into a muon ($\mu^+$) and a neutrino ($\nu$), we use conservation of energy and momentum. The rest masses are given as 139.6 MeV/$c^2$ for $\pi^+$ and 105.7 MeV/$c^2$ for $\mu^+$. 

1. **Energy Conservation**: The total energy before decay (rest energy of $\pi^+$) equals the total energy after decay (sum of energies of $\mu^+$ and $\nu$):
   \[
   m_{\pi} c^2 = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}
   \]
   where $E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 c^2 + m_{\mu}^2 c^4}$ and $E_{\nu} = pc$ (since the neutrino is massless).

2. **Momentum Conservation**: The magnitudes of the momenta of $\mu^+$ and $\nu$ are equal ($p$) but opposite in direction.

3. **Solving for Momentum**: Substitute the expressions for $E_{\mu}$ and $E_{\nu}$ into the energy conservation equation:
   \[
   139.6 = \sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} + p
   \]
   Solving this equation:
   \[
   139.6 - p = \sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2}
   \]
   Squaring both sides and simplifying:
   \[
   139.6^2 - 105.7^2 = 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p \implies p = \frac{139.6^2 - 105.7^2}{2 \cdot 139.6} \approx 29.78 \text{ MeV}
   \]

4. **Kinetic Energies**:
   - **Muon**: KE of $\mu^+$ is $E_{\mu} - m_{\mu}$. Calculate $E_{\mu} = \sqrt{(29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2} \approx 109.81$ MeV, so KE $\approx 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11$ MeV.
   - **Neutrino**: KE of $\nu$ is $E_{\nu} = pc \approx 29.78$ MeV.

The closest answer matching these values is A) 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.

\boxed{A}

okay, so i need to find the kinetic energies of the product particles in the decay of a pi-plus meson into a muon and a neutrino. the problem states that the pi-plus is stationary, which means the muon and neutrino will have opposite momenta to conserve momentum. the rest masses are given as 139.6 mev/c2 for the pi-plus and 105.7 mev/c2 for the muon. the neutrino is massless, i think? well, the problem doesn't give a rest mass for the neutrino, so maybe it's assumed to be massless. that would make sense because neutrinos have very small masses, and in many problems, they are approximated as massless particles, like photons. so, the neutrino is like a photon in terms of having energy and momentum but no rest mass. okay, so the decay is pi-plus at rest decaying into a muon and a neutrino. this is similar to a charged pion decay, right? so, i need to use conservation of energy and momentum. since the pi-plus is at rest, the total momentum before the decay is zero. therefore, the total momentum after the decay must also be zero. that means the momentum of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. so, their momenta are equal but opposite, so their magnitudes are the same. so, if i denote the momentum of the muon as p, then the momentum of the neutrino is also p, but in the opposite direction. now, energy and momentum are related for each particle. for the muon, since it's a massive particle, its energy (e_mu) is given by sqrt((pc)^2 + (m_mu c2)^2). similarly, for the neutrino, since it's massless, its energy (e_nu) is just pc. the total energy before the decay is just the rest energy of the pi-plus, which is m_pi c2. so, 139.6 mev. after the decay, the total energy is the sum of the muon's energy and the neutrino's energy. so, we have: m_pi c2 = e_mu + e_nu but e_mu = sqrt((p^2 c^2) + (m_mu^2 c^4)) e_nu = p c therefore, 139.6 mev = sqrt((p^2 c^2) + (105.7^2 c^4 / c^2)) + p c wait, the units here are a bit confusing, but since we're working in natural units where c=1, this simplifies. maybe i should set c=1 to make the calculations easier. so, in natural units (where c=1), the energy and mass are equivalent. so, m_pi = 139.6 mev, m_mu = 105.7 mev, and the neutrino mass is 0. so, the equation becomes: m_pi = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p so, 139.6 = sqrt(p^2 + 105.7^2) + p this equation can be solved for p. let me rearrange it. subtract p from both sides: 139.6 - p = sqrt(p^2 + 105.7^2) now, square both sides: (139.6 - p)^2 = p^2 + 105.7^2 expand the left side: 139.6^2 - 2*139.6*p + p^2 = p^2 + 105.7^2 subtract p^2 from both sides: 139.6^2 - 2*139.6*p = 105.7^2 then, move 105.7^2 to the left: 139.6^2 - 105.7^2 - 2*139.6*p = 0 factor the difference of squares: (139.6 - 105.7)(139.6 + 105.7) - 2*139.6*p = 0 calculate each term: 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 139.6 + 105.7 = 245.3 so, 33.9 * 245.3 - 2*139.6*p = 0 calculate 33.9 * 245.3. let me compute that. first, 30 * 245.3 = 7359 3.9 * 245.3 = 956.67 so, total is 7359 + 956.67 ≈ 8315.67 therefore, 8315.67 - 2*139.6*p = 0 so, 2*139.6*p = 8315.67 => p = 8315.67 / (2*139.6) calculate denominator: 2*139.6 = 279.2 so, p = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let me compute that. 279.2 * 30 ≈ 8376, which is a bit more than 8315.67. so, 30 - (8376 - 8315.67)/279.2 ≈ 30 - 60.33/279.2 ≈ 30 - 0.216 ≈ 29.784 so, approximately p ≈ 29.78 mev/c. so, the momentum p is approximately 29.78 mev/c. now, the kinetic energy of the muon is e_mu - m_mu. so, first find e_mu which is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2). but wait, earlier we set c=1, so e_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2). but actually, in natural units, e_mu would be in units of mass (mev/c2), but since we've already been working in units where c=1, maybe everything is in mev. wait, perhaps the masses are given in mev, which actually is equivalent to mev/c2 when talking about rest mass. so perhaps in this problem, they just use mev as the mass. so, m_pi is 139.6 mev, which actually should be m_pi c2 = 139.6 mev, so m_pi = 139.6 mev/c2. but when we calculate the energy e_mu in natural units (where c=1), it's e_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2). but then, the energy in mev would be e_mu * c2? wait, this might be getting confusing. let me clarify. let's recall that in particle physics, it's common to use units where c = 1, so energies and rest masses can be expressed in the same units, like mev. so, the rest mass of the pi-plus is 139.6 mev/c2, but when c=1, that becomes 139.6 mev. similarly, the rest mass of the muon is 105.7 mev/c2 becomes 105.7 mev. the momentum p would have units of mev/c, but with c=1, it's just mev. then, energy has units of mev. so, the energy of the muon would be e_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) where p is in mev and m_mu is in mev. therefore, e_mu is in mev. then, the kinetic energy of the muon is e_mu - m_mu. similarly, the energy of the neutrino is e_nu = p c, but with c=1, that's just p, so e_nu = p. therefore, the total energy is m_pi c2 = e_mu + e_nu = (sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p). but since m_pi c2 = 139.6 mev and m_mu c2 = 105.7 mev, we have: 139.6 = sqrt(p2 + 105.72) + p which is the same equation as before. then, solving for p, we got approximately p ≈ 29.78 mev (since c=1, units of p are mev). therefore, the energy of the neutrino e_nu = p = 29.78 mev. the kinetic energy of the muon is e_mu - m_mu = (sqrt(p2 + m_mu2) - m_mu). let's compute that. first, compute e_mu: e_mu = sqrt(29.782 + 105.72) 29.78 squared: approx 886.8 mev2 105.7 squared: 105.7*105.7. 1002=10000, 100*5.7=5700, 5.72=32.49. so, 105.72 = (100+5.7)^2 = 1002 + 2*100*5.7 + 5.72 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49. so, 886.8 + 11172.49 ≈ 12059.29. so, sqrt(12059.29) ≈ 109.81 mev. therefore, e_mu ≈ 109.81 mev. then, kinetic energy of muon (ke_mu) = e_mu - m_mu = 109.81 - 105.7 ≈ 4.11 mev. then, ke_nu is e_nu, which is 29.78 mev. but wait, the neutrino's energy is e_nu = p = 29.78 mev, but since the neutrino is massless, all its energy is kinetic. therefore, ke_nu = e_nu = 29.78 mev. so, the kinetic energies are approximately 4.11 mev and 29.78 mev. looking at the answer choices, option a is 4.12 mev and 29.8 mev, which is very close. but let me check my approximation to see if a more precise calculation is needed. maybe my approximation when calculating p was a bit rough. let me go back and compute p more accurately. original equation: 139.6 = sqrt(p2 + 105.72) + p rearranged: 139.6 - p = sqrt(p2 + 105.72) squared: 139.62 - 2*139.6 p + p2 = p2 + 105.72 simplify: 139.62 - 2*139.6 p = 105.72 subtract: 139.62 - 105.72 = 2*139.6 p so, p = (139.62 - 105.72)/(2*139.6) compute numerator: 139.6 + 105.7 = 245.3 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 so, (139.62 - 105.72) = (139.6 - 105.7)*(139.6 + 105.7) = 33.9 * 245.3 calculate 33.9 * 245.3. let me compute this more accurately. first, 33.9 * 200 = 6780 33.9 * 45 = 1525.5 33.9 * 0.3 = 10.17 total = 6780 + 1525.5 + 10.17 = 8315.67 so numerator is 8315.67 denominator is 2*139.6 = 279.2 therefore, p = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's compute this division. 279.2 * 29 = 279.2*30 = 8376 - 279.2 = 8376 - 279.2 = 8096.8 wait, no. wait 279.2 * 30 = 8376, so 279.2 * 29 = 8376 - 279.2 = 8096.8. but 8315.67 is less than 8376, so 279.2 * (29 + (8315.67 - 8096.8)/279.2) = 279.2*(29 + 218.87/279.2) 218.87 / 279.2 ≈ 0.784 so, p ≈ 29 + 0.784 ≈ 29.784 mev so, p ≈ 29.784 mev, which is the momentum. then, the energy of the neutrino is e_nu = p*c, but since in our units c=1, e_nu = p = 29.784 mev. so, the neutrino's kinetic energy is 29.784 mev. now, compute the muon's energy: e_mu = sqrt(p2 + m_mu2) = sqrt((29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2) compute 29.7842: 29.784 * 29.784 ≈ (30 - 0.216)^2 ≈ 900 - 2*30*0.216 + 0.2162 ≈ 900 - 12.96 + 0.046 ≈ 887.086 mev2 similarly, 105.72 = 11172.49 (as computed earlier). so, e_mu = sqrt(887.086 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.576) ≈ 109.816 mev therefore, kinetic energy of muon is e_mu - m_mu = 109.816 - 105.7 ≈ 4.116 mev so, approximately 4.12 mev and 29.784 mev. the closest answer is a) 4.12 mev, 29.8 mev. so, the correct answer should be a. wait, but let me check the other options. wait, the options are given as: a) 4.12 mev, 29.8 mev b) 2.84 mev, 26.8 mev c) 7.2 mev, 32.8 mev d) 3.52 mev, 20.8 mev so, if our calculation gives 4.116 mev and 29.78 mev, which rounds to 4.12 mev and 29.8 mev, so answer a. so, why would the other options be incorrect? let's think. option b has lower energies, perhaps a mistake in calculation. option c higher. option d in between. but our step-by-step calculation matches answer a. therefore, the correct answer is a. wait, but let me check if there's another approach. let me recall that in a decay where a particle at rest decays into two particles, one massive and one massless, the energies can be calculated using the formulas: e1 = (m_parent2 c4 + m_child12 c^4)/(2 m_parent c2) and e2 = (m_parent2 c4 - m_child12 c^4)/(2 m_parent c2) wait, perhaps these formulas are applicable here. wait, in the case where a particle decays into two particles, one of which is massless (like a neutrino), the energies are given by e_photon = (m_parent2 - m_daughter2)/(2 m_parent) and e_daughter = (m_parent2 + m_daughter2)/(2 m_parent) wait, let me check. in natural units where c=1, the energy of the daughter particle (muon) would be (m_pi2 + m_mu2)/(2 m_pi) and the energy of the neutrino would be (m_pi2 - m_mu2)/(2 m_pi). then, kinetic energy of muon is e_daughter - m_mu, and ke of neutrino is e_photon since it's massless. wait, let's try this. compute e_mu = (m_pi2 + m_mu2)/(2 m_pi) e_nu = (m_pi2 - m_mu2)/(2 m_pi) compute m_pi = 139.6, m_mu = 105.7 e_mu = (139.62 + 105.72)/(2*139.6) e_nu = (139.62 - 105.72)/(2*139.6) compute numerator terms: 139.62 = 19,500.16 (since 139.6*139.6 = (140-0.4)^2 = 1402 - 2*140*0.4 +0.42=19600 -112 +0.16=19488.16, wait, but 139.6 is actually: 139.6 * 139.6: calculate 130*130=16900, 130*9.6=1152, 9.6*130=1152, 9.6*9.6=92.16. so, total: 16900 + 1152 + 1152 + 92.16 = 16900 + 2352 + 92.16 = 19352 + 92.16 = 19444.16. wait, no. wait 139 * 139 = 19321. then 139.6 = 139 + 0.6. so, (a + b)^2 = a2 + 2ab + b2. here, a = 139, b = 0.6. so, 1392 = 19321, 2*139*0.6 = 166.8, 0.62=0.36. so total: 19321 + 166.8 + 0.36 = 19488.16. so, 139.62 = 19488.16. similarly, 105.72 = 11172.49. therefore: e_mu = (19488.16 + 11172.49)/(2*139.6) = (30660.65)/279.2 ≈ 109.81 mev e_nu = (19488.16 - 11172.49)/279.2 = 8315.67/279.2 ≈ 29.78 mev therefore, ke_mu = e_mu - m_mu = 109.81 - 105.7 ≈ 4.11 mev ke_nu = e_nu = 29.78 mev, since neutrino is massless. so, this again gives the same result as before. therefore, answer a. so, why are the other options different? let's see option b: 2.84 and 26.8. perhaps if there was a mistake in calculating the momentum? wait, maybe if someone used the non-relativistic approximation, which would be way off here. but given that we're dealing with particles near the mass scale of mesons and muons, relativistic effects are significant, so non-relativistic approximation is invalid. option c: 7.2 and 32.8. maybe if someone added energies without considering the mass properly. option d: 3.52 and 20.8. maybe confused with a different problem. so, all other options seem inconsistent with the calculation. therefore, the correct answer must be a. wait, but let me check the ke values again. for the neutrino, since it's massless, all its energy is kinetic. so e_nu = pc = ke_nu. for the muon, ke_mu = e_mu - m_mu. so, we have the total energy: m_pi c2 = 139.6 mev = e_mu + e_nu = (ke_mu + m_mu c2) + ke_nu = ke_mu + m_mu c2 + ke_nu. but in our case, ke_mu = 4.11 mev, ke_nu = 29.78 mev. so total ke: 4.11 + 29.78 = 33.89 mev. then, m_pi c2 - m_mu c2 = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 mev, which matches the total ke. so this is a good check. so, indeed, the sum of the kinetic energies is equal to the mass difference, which is consistent with conservation of energy. therefore, answer a is correct.

answer: to find the kinetic energies (ke) of the muon and neutrino in the decay of a stationary pi-plus meson ($\pi^+$) into a muon ($\mu^+$) and a neutrino ($\nu$), we use conservation of energy and momentum. the rest masses are given as 139.6 mev/$c^2$ for $\pi^+$ and 105.7 mev/$c^2$ for $\mu^+$. 

1. **energy conservation**: the total energy before decay (rest energy of $\pi^+$) equals the total energy after decay (sum of energies of $\mu^+$ and $\nu$):
   \[
   m_{\pi} c^2 = e_{\mu} + e_{\nu}
   \]
   where $e_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 c^2 + m_{\mu}^2 c^4}$ and $e_{\nu} = pc$ (since the neutrino is massless).

2. **momentum conservation**: the magnitudes of the momenta of $\mu^+$ and $\nu$ are equal ($p$) but opposite in direction.

3. **solving for momentum**: substitute the expressions for $e_{\mu}$ and $e_{\nu}$ into the energy conservation equation:
   \[
   139.6 = \sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} + p
   \]
   solving this equation:
   \[
   139.6 - p = \sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2}
   \]
   squaring both sides and simplifying:
   \[
   139.6^2 - 105.7^2 = 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p \implies p = \frac{139.6^2 - 105.7^2}{2 \cdot 139.6} \approx 29.78 \text{ mev}
   \]

4. **kinetic energies**:
   - **muon**: ke of $\mu^+$ is $e_{\mu} - m_{\mu}$. calculate $e_{\mu} = \sqrt{(29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2} \approx 109.81$ mev, so ke $\approx 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11$ mev.
   - **neutrino**: ke of $\nu$ is $e_{\nu} = pc \approx 29.78$ mev.

the closest answer matching these values is a) 4.12 mev and 29.8 mev.

\boxed{a}
