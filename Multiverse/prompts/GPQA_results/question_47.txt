Okay, let's try to solve this problem. So, the question is about identifying a compound with the formula C9H11NO2 using IR and 1H NMR data provided. The options are A to D. Let's break down the information step by step.
First, let me recall what each type of spectroscopy tells us. IR spectroscopy gives information about functional groups based on the presence of certain absorption bands. The NMR, specifically 1H NMR here, gives details about the hydrogen environments and the structure's connectivity.
Starting with the IR data: There are medium to strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. These are likely N–H stretching vibrations. The presence of two bands suggests some splitting, maybe due to hydrogen bonding or different amine environments. Then there's a strong band at 1720 cm-1. That's typical for a carbonyl group (C=O). So the compound has a carbonyl and an amine group. The amine might be aromatic since amines on benzene rings can have different IR characteristics. The carbonyl at 1720 is probably from an ester, amide, or maybe a ketone. But given the formula has O and N, an ester or amide is more likely. Wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's confirm that. The formula for each option would help. Let me check later when considering the options. But first, let's parse the NMR data.
The 1H NMR data: 1.20 ppm (t, 3H); 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H); 4.5 ppm (q, 2H); 7.0 ppm (d, 2H); 8.0 ppm (d, 2H).
Starting with the splitting patterns. A "t" is a triplet, "q" is a quartet, "d" is a doublet, and "s" is a singlet. But here, "bs" likely means broad singlet.
First, the signal at 1.20 ppm as a triplet (3H). That's probably a methyl group adjacent to a CH2. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Then 4.0 ppm, broad singlet (bs) for 2H. A broad peak could indicate exchange broadening, common for NH groups. So maybe two NH protons. Wait, but maybe not necessarily—sometimes impurities or other factors. But amine protons can be broad. Then 4.5 ppm, quartet (2H). Quartet comes from coupling with three protons. So this would be a CH2 group next to a CH3. Connecting the dots: 1.20 ppm triplet (3H) and 4.5 ppm quartet (2H)—this is typical for an ethyl group. The ethyl group has the CH3 at around 1.2 ppm (triplet) and the CH2 at around 4.5 ppm (quartet). The chemical shift of the CH2 is influenced by adjacent functional groups. If the CH2 is next to an oxygen, maybe in an ester or ether. The 4.5 ppm seems a bit upfield for an ester (like ethyl acetate has the CH2 around 4-4.5 ppm maybe?), but maybe. Then the 7.0 and 8.0 ppm doublets. 7.0 ppm could be an OCH2 or possibly para-substituted aromatic protons. Wait, but if there are two doublets for 2H each, that's four aromatic protons total. Wait, but substituents on benzene rings can split the adjacent protons. For example, para-substituted benzene might have two doublets if there are two substituents? Let's see. If the ring is substituted at the para position, say, with an ester and an amine, then the remaining aromatic protons could be split into two doublets. Alternatively, maybe ortho or meta substituents causing certain splitting. But let's look at the chemical shifts. 7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm. For benzene rings, para-substituted protons (like in nitrobenzene) are around 7.5-8.0 ppm, but that can vary. However, if there is electron-withdrawing groups (EWG) like nitro or carbonyl, the protons are shifted upfield or downfield. Wait, carbonyl groups adjacent would deshield the protons, moving them upfield or downfield? Wait, downfield. So, if the aromatic protons are adjacent to a carbonyl, they would be at higher ppm. For example, in nitrobenzene, the proton is at 8.1 ppm. If there's an amine (electron donating group), it could cause the adjacent protons to be upfield. But in this case, the signals are at 7.0 and 8.0. So maybe the substituents are in para positions. Let's imagine a benzene ring with two substituents: one is an ester or carbonyl group (pulling the protons downfield, so around 8.0 ppm) and another is an amine (which donates electrons, so the adjacent protons are upfield, like 7.0 ppm). Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in positions that the remaining protons are split into two doublets. But how? Wait, another possibility is that the aromatic protons are split by coupling to adjacent protons, but usually, in a benzene ring, protons are split into multiplets unless there's symmetry. Wait, if there are two doublets, each integrating to 2H, that suggests symmetry. For example, if the substituents are in the para positions, then the remaining two pairs of equivalent protons would each be adjacent to different substituents. Wait, maybe not. Let me think. If the benzene ring has substituents in positions 1 and 3 (meta), then the equivalent protons would be in positions 2, 4, 5, 6. But maybe that's not symmetrical. Alternatively, if substituents are para, like positions 1 and 4, then the remaining protons would be in positions 2, 3, 5, 6. But these are not equivalent. Wait, but maybe if the substituents are such that there are two pairs of equivalent protons. For instance, if the benzene ring has two substituents in the ortho positions, then maybe the remaining equivalent protons are in two doublets. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the aromatic protons are split by coupling to each other. In simple cases, like o-dichlorobenzene, you have two doublets. But that's when there are two adjacent Cl atoms, so the protons are split. Wait, perhaps in this case, the two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm each integrating to 2H could be two sets of equivalent protons. That would mean the aromatic ring has two different environments for the protons, each with two equivalent protons. This might happen if there's a substituent that breaks the symmetry. For example, if there is an ester group in the para position and another group in the meta position? Hmm, maybe I need to think of specific structures.
Alternatively, maybe the compound is a benzoate ester. Let's see. Option B is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Let's consider that structure. Benzoate ester would have the ester group (COOEt) on the benzene ring. The 4-aminobenzoate would have an amine group at position 4 (para) of the benzene ring, and the ester at position 1. Wait, but if the ester is at position 1 (carboxylic acid becomes ester), then the amine is at position 4. So the benzene ring has COOEt in position 1 and NH2 in position 4. Then the aromatic protons would be split into two doublets. Wait, in such a case, the ring would have substituents in positions 1 and 4. The protons adjacent to these substituents would be deshielded or shielded. But how many protons would be affected? If the COOEt is in position 1 and NH2 in position 4, then the adjacent protons would be in positions 2 and 3 (next to COOEt) and position 5 (next to NH2)? Wait, positions 2 and 6? Hmm, maybe. Wait, let me draw the structure: Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1 (COOEt) and 4 (NH2). Then the remaining aromatic protons would be in positions 2, 3, 5, and 6. However, due to the substituents in positions 1 and 4, the ring is symmetric. Wait, but the substituents are in para positions, so the molecule is symmetric. Therefore, positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and positions 3 and 5 would be equivalent. So that would give two doublets in the NMR. Each doublet would correspond to two equivalent protons. The positions adjacent to the ester (positions 2 and 3) might have one set of chemical shifts, and positions 5 and 6 (adjacent to the amine) another. The ester is an electron-withdrawing group, so the adjacent protons (positions 2 and 3) would be deshielded, appearing downfield (higher ppm). The amine is electron-donating, so the adjacent protons (positions 5 and 6) would be upfield (lower ppm). But in the given NMR data, the doublets are at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. If the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the ester is at position 1, amine at position 4. The protons adjacent to the ester (position 2 and 3) would be around 8.0 ppm (due to deshielding by the ester), and the protons adjacent to the amine (position 5 and 6) would be upfield, maybe around 7.0 ppm. That would match the two doublets. Then, the NMR would have these two doublets integrating to 2H each. So that part fits.
Next, the ethyl group in the ester. The ester would have CH2CH3 attached. The CH2CH3 (ethyl group) would have a CH3 at around 1.2 ppm as a triplet (since it's CH2CH3, the CH3 is next to the CH2), and the CH2 at around 4.5 ppm as a quartet. That's exactly what is seen in the NMR data: 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H). The 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) would then correspond to the NH2 group. Since the amine is attached to the aromatic ring (as in 4-aminobenzoate), the NH2 would be in a para position. Aromatic amines can be broad in the NMR due to exchange broadening. So that matches. Let's check the IR data. The IR shows medium to strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. These are likely N–H stretches, so the amine (NH2) is present. The splitting into two bands could be due to the amine being next to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester), causing hydrogen bonding. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is the carbonyl stretch of the ester (COOEt). So that all checks out. Let's verify the molecular formula. The compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The benzoate part is from benzoic acid (C7H6O2). When converted to ethyl ester, the formula becomes C7H5O2 (from benzoate) + C2H5O (from ethyl group) — wait, no. Wait, benzoic acid is C7H6O2. The ester would be C7H5O2 (benzoate) combined with ethanol (C2H6O), but the ester linkage removes a water molecule, so the ester part is -COOCH2CH3. Therefore, the total formula for ethyl benzoate is C7H5O2 (benzoate) + C2H5 (ethyl) = C9H10O2. But then adding the NH2 group (amine) replaces a hydrogen. Wait, no. Wait, benzoic acid is C7H6O2. If we substitute hydrogen with NH2, we get an amino group. Wait, but when the benzoate is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the formula would be: The parent is benzoic acid (C7H6O2). Replacing one H with NH2: becomes C7H5NH2O2. Then forming the ethyl ester: replacing the COOH with COOCH2CH3. So the formula would be: C7 (from benzene) + 5 H (remaining from benzene after substitution) + NH2 (1 N, 2 H) + COOCH2CH3 (C2H5O2). Wait, the COOCH2CH3 group adds 2 O and 2 C and 5 H (the ethyl group is -O-CH2CH3: O, CH2CH3. So the ethyl group has 2 C, 5 H, and the O is part of the ester linkage). So total H: from benzene (originally 6 H; after substituting one H with COOCH2CH3 and another with NH2, we have 4 H remaining on the ring) + 5 H from ethyl group? Wait, maybe I need to count carefully. Wait, the benzene ring has 6 C. In benzoic acid, it's -COOH. So when converting to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the structure is: the benzene ring with substituents at positions 1 (COOCH2CH3) and 4 (NH2). The benzene ring has 6 C. The COOCH2CH3 adds 2 C (from the ethyl group) and the NH2 is just N and 2 H. So total carbons: benzene (6 C) + 2 C (from ethyl) = 8 C. Wait, but the compound in question is C9H11NO2. Wait, according to the molecular formula given in the problem, it's C9H11NO2. But according to my count for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: Carbons: benzene (6) + 2 (from ethyl) = 8. But the compound is supposed to have 9 C. So that's an issue. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, the benzoate ester would have: the benzene ring (6 C) plus the ethyl group in the ester (COOCH2CH3). So the ester comes from benzoic acid (COOH group), replacing the OH with OCH2CH3. So the ethyl group is two carbons, making a total of 6 + 2 = 8 carbons. Then, the remaining carbon must be from another group. Wait, but the formula given is C9H11NO2. That's 9 C, 11 H, 1 N, 2 O. So where is the ninth carbon? If the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, it should have 8 carbons. Hence, this is a problem. Therefore, option B is incorrect. So maybe my initial thought was wrong. Alternatively, maybe the structure is different. Let's consider other options. Option A: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Let's parse this. Phenyl propionate would be a propionyl group attached to a benzene ring (as COOCH2CH2CH3?), but I'm not sure. Wait, "4-aminophenyl propionate" could mean that the benzene ring has an amino group at position 4 and a propionate ester (CH2CH2COO-) group at position 1? Wait, but propionate is CH2CH2COO-. No, wait, propionic acid is CH2CH2COOH, so propionate would be CH2CH2COO-. So if it's 4-aminophenyl propionate, perhaps the benzene ring has an aminophenyl group (NH2C6H4-) attached to the propionate ester? Hmm, maybe the structure is CH2CH2COO- substituted with a 4-aminophenyl group. Alternatively, maybe it's a benzene ring with NH2 and a propionate group. Let's see. But perhaps the formula would be: For propionic acid (CH2CH2COOH), forming an ester with a phenyl group. Wait, maybe the structure is (4-aminophenyl) propionate, which would be propionic acid esterified with 4-aminophenyl. So the structure is: Ph-NH2 → substituting one H of benzene with NH2, and another H with COOCH2CH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, propionate is the CH2CH2COO- group. So if it's 4-aminophenyl propionate, the propionate ester is on the 4-aminophenyl group. Wait, perhaps the benzene ring has an NH2 group at position 4, and the COOCH2CH2CH3 group at position 1. Then, the molecular formula would be: Benzene (6 C) + propyl group (3 C) in the ester. So 6 + 3 = 9 C. That matches the formula C9H11NO2. Let's see. The molecular formula for option A: 4-aminophenyl propionate. If the benzene ring has NH2 at position 4 and the propionate ester (COOCH2CH2CH3) at position 1. Then, the molecular formula would be: For benzene: 6 C. For propionate ester: COOCH2CH2CH3. That's 3 C from the propyl chain (CH2CH2CH3). So total 6 + 3 = 9 C. Nitrogen is present once from the amine. O is present twice: one from the carboxyl and one from the ester. So that's C9H??NO2. Wait, but let's calculate the hydrogen. Wait, benzene with substituents: when you have a benzene ring with two substituents, each replacing a hydrogen. The original benzene has 6 H. If you substitute two positions, you lose two H, so remaining H on benzene is 4. Then the propionate ester group is COOCH2CH2CH3: The ester linkage adds O and the propyl group. The COO- would have the usual oxygen. The propyl group is CH2CH2CH3, which has 7 H (CH2 has 2 H, CH2 has 2 H, CH3 has 3 H). Then, the NH2 group has 2 H. So total H: 4 (remaining on benzene) + 7 (propyl) + 2 (NH2) = 13 H. Then, the formula would be C9H13NO2. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So that doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating. Wait, perhaps the propionate ester is (CH3CH2CH2COO-), which is n-propyl acetate? Wait, propionate is -CH2CH2COO-. No, wait, propionic acid is CH3CH2COOH. Therefore, propionate would be CH3CH2COO-. So if the ester is, say, methyl propionate (which is CH3CH2COOCH3), but in this case, if it's phenyl propionate, then perhaps the ester is between the benzene ring and the propionate. Wait, but if the benzene ring is substituted with NH2 and COOCH2CH2CH3, then the total H would be different. Wait, perhaps my mistake is in the propionate ester. Let me check again: If the propionate ester is -O-CH2-CH2-COOPh, where Ph is the 4-aminophenyl group. Wait, no. Alternatively, if the structure is Ph-COO-CH2-CH2-CH2-O-R? No, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look at another option. Option C: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Let's break this down. Formamide is HCONH2, but substituted here. N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide would be HCONH-C6H4-OCH2CH3 (substituted on the benzene ring at position 4 with ethoxy). The molecular formula: Formamide part is HCONH2. But when substituted with 4-ethoxyphenyl, perhaps the structure is Ph-C(O)-NH2, where Ph is the 4-ethoxyphenyl. Wait, no. Wait, N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide would be the formamide (HCONH2) where one of the H on the NH2 is replaced by a 4-ethoxyphenyl group. So the structure would be O=C(NHPh)H, where Ph is the 4-ethoxyphenyl group. Wait, formamide is HCONH2. If we replace one H on the NH2 with a phenyl group, substituted at the 4-position with ethoxy. So the structure would be HCONH-Ph-Ethoxy. So the molecular formula: The benzene (C6H5) with OCH2CH3 (ethoxy) at para and connected via N. So total carbons: 6 (benzene) + 2 (ethoxy) = 8 C. But the compound is supposed to have 9 C. Therefore, the formamide part has one more carbon? Wait, formamide is HCONH2, which has 1 C. So total C: 6 (benzene) + 2 (ethoxy) + 1 (formamide C) = 9 C. Okay, that's plausible. So the formula would be C9H??NO2. Let's calculate H: Benzene with 4-ethoxy group: original benzene has 6 H. Substituted at position 4 with OCH2CH3. So five positions left, each with one H (since substituted in para, the available positions are ortho and meta, but how does that affect H count?). Wait, when you substitute one position on benzene with ethoxy, the number of H atoms on the benzene ring is reduced by one (from 6 to 5). Then, the ethoxy group is OCH2CH3, which has 7 H (each CH3 and CH2). Then, the formamide part is HCONH-Ph. The HCONH- part has: the H (from formamide) and the Ph would connect to N. So the HCONH- would have one H on the carbonyl carbon, then the N is connected to the phenyl group and one H. So each HCONH- would have one H (on the N) and one H (on the carbonyl). Wait, formamide is HCONH2, but in this case, substituted with phenyl: HCONH-Ph. Therefore, the H on the carbonyl would still be present? Wait, formamide has H2N-C(O)-H. If you replace one H on the NH with phenyl, you get Ph-NH-C(O)-H. So that structure would still have an NH (one H) and a CONH. Wait, no. If formamide is HCONH2, substituting one H with phenyl would give PhCONH2. Wait, that's not N- substituted. Wait, formamide is HCONH2. If we substitute the N with a phenyl group, replacing one H, it's PhCONH2. That would be an acylamide. Wait, but the question's option C is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So formamide is HCONH2. N-substituted would be HCONR2. Wait, no. Formamide is HCONH2. So N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide would be HCONHp where p is 4-ethoxyphenyl. Wait, maybe the structure is O=C(NPh)H2, but that can't be. Wait, perhaps it's Ph-N-C(O)-H. That would be formamide with one phenyl group. The structure would be: Formamide (HCONH2) where one H on the NH2 is replaced by a phenyl group. But that would be aryl formamide. So the structure would be Ph-N-C(O)-H. Then, the H on the carbonyl side is still present. The molecular formula would be: C6H5 (Ph) + CONH. Wait, the CONH would come from formamide. The CONH group has 1 C, 1 O, 1 N, and one H. So the total would be: Ph (6 C) + CONH (1 C) = 7 C. But the compound is supposed to have 9 C. The 4-ethoxyphenyl group is Ph-OCH2CH3. So the ethoxy group adds 2 C (OCH2CH3). Therefore, total C: 6 (Ph) + 2 (ethoxy) + 1 (formamide C) = 9 C. So the formula is C9H??NO2. Let's compute H: The benzene ring with ethoxy substituent: original 6 H on benzene, but substituting at 4 with OCH2CH3. So the benzene has 5 H left. The ethoxy group has 7 H (OCH2CH3: each CH3 is 3 H, CH2 is 2 H). Then, the formamide part: HCONH(Ph). The HCONH has one H on the carbonyl and one H on the nitrogen (since the other is the Ph). So that's one H on carbonyl and one H on N. So total H: 5 (benzene) + 7 (ethoxy) + 1 (carbonyl H) + 1 (NH) = 14 H. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So 14 H is more than the required 11. Therefore, this can't be correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in substitution. Wait, perhaps the structure is different. If the compound is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, maybe the formamide is attached to the benzene via the nitrogen. So the structure would be benzene ring with N attached, which is part of the formamide. Wait, but formamide is HCONH2. If N is bonded to the benzene ring, making it an aniline derivative with formamide group. Wait, that would be different. Let's clarify. If it's N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, the structure should be: The formamide is HCONH-Ph, where Ph is 4-ethoxyphenyl. So the HCONH2 becomes HCONH-Ph, substituting one H on the nitrogen with the 4-ethoxyphenyl group. Therefore, structure is O=C(NPh)H, where Ph is 4-ethoxyphenyl. In that case, the H on the nitrogen is lost, but the carbonyl has one H. Then, the 4-ethoxyphenyl group is C6H4-OCH2CH3. So the H count on that group: C6H4 (since substituted with OCH2CH3). For C6H4-OCH2CH3: the benzene has 4 H (since two positions are substituted: one with OCH2CH3 and one with N... Wait, but in this case, the nitrogen is part of the formamide. So if the benzene is C6H5N... Wait, perhaps I'm mixing substituents. Let me think again. If the formamide is HCONH-Ph, where Ph is 4-ethoxyphenyl, then the benzene ring (as 4-ethoxyphenyl) has five substituents? No. Wait, the 4-ethoxyphenyl group is a phenyl group with an ethoxy group in the 4-position. So the phenyl group has OCH2CH3 at position 4, and is attached via position 1 to the formamide. Wait, but the attachment point for the "phenyl" group in N-aryl formamides is via the ring. So the 4-ethoxyphenyl group is a benzene ring with ethoxy at position 4, and the rest is attached at position 1 (the para position) to the nitrogen of the formamide. Wait, maybe not. If the substituent is in the 4-position, then the attachment point of the formamide would be at the benzene's position 1, making the ethoxy group at position 4 relative to the attached formamide. Maybe this is getting too complicated. Let's just focus on the H count. Suppose the benzene ring has an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) and is attached to the formamide (O=C(NH)–Ph–). The benzene ring would have four H if substituted in the 4-position. Wait, benzene has 6 positions. If the substituent (ethoxy) is at position 4, and the formamide is attached at position 1 (as the aryl group in the formamide). Wait, but how is that possible? The formamide is HCONH-Ph. The Ph is aryl, which is a substituent. So the benzene ring is attached via a substituent (the aryl group) to the nitrogen in the formamide. Therefore, the benzene ring has ethoxy at position 4, and the attachment to the formamide is at position 1. So the benzene ring has substituents at positions 1 and 4. Therefore, the remaining positions 2, 3, 5, 6 each have one H. So benzene contributes 6 H (positions 2,3,5,6 and two more?), no, wait. If the benzene ring is substituted at positions 1 and 4, then each of those positions has a substituent. The remaining positions are 2,3,4,5,6. Wait, no. Each substituent is in one position. So substituting in positions 1 and 4 removes two H atoms from those positions. Therefore, the remaining H on the benzene ring are 6 - 2 = 4 H. Then, the ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) has 2 CH2 and one CH3. So the ethoxy group has 2 (from CH2) + 2 (from another CH2) + 3 (from CH3) = 7 H. The formamide part: O=C(NH-Ph)H. So the carbonyl has one H (the other is connected to N), and the N has one H (since the other is connected to Ph). So that's one H on carbonyl and one H on N. So total H: 4 (benzene) + 7 (ethoxy) + 1 (carbonyl) + 1 (NH) = 13 H. Still more than the required 11. So this doesn't match. So option C is out.
Option D: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Let's consider this. Benzamide is benzene carboxamide (CONH2 substituent on benzene). If it's 3-ethoxybenzamide, then the benzene ring has an ethoxy group at position 3 and a carbamide (CONH2) at position 1 (assuming numbering). Wait, but when substituting, the positions would affect the NMR. Let's see. The molecular formula for 3-ethoxybenzamide: Benzamide (C7H7NO2). Then, substituting a ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) at position 3 would add 2 C and 5 H (?). Wait, original benzamide is C7H7NO2. If substituting one H with OCH2CH3, then the formula becomes: C7 (from benzamide) + 2 C (from ethoxy) = C9. So that matches. The H count would be: Original benzamide has 7 H. When substituting a H with OCH2CH3, you lose one H and add 5 H (from OCH2CH3, which has 2 CH2 and one O. Wait, OCH2CH3 has 2 CH2 groups (each with two H) and one CH3 (three H). So total 2 + 2 + 3 = 7 H. So substituting one H with OCH2CH3 adds 7 - 1 = 6 H. So original H is 7. Then, substituting gives 7 + 6 = 13 H. But the formula given is C9H11NO2, which has 11 H. So discrepancy here. So this can't be correct. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the structure is different. If the benzamide is substituted with ethoxy at position 3, then perhaps the H count is different. Wait, benzamide (CONH2) is substituted on benzene. So substituting a H with OCH2CH3 would require replacing one H with OCH2CH3. So the molecule would be C9H11NO2. Wait, let's recalculate H: Benzamide has the structure Ph-C(O)-NH2. The parent benzamide (without substitution) has 7 H: 3 H on the benzene ring adjacent to the CONH2 group, and 4 H on the other positions (since the CONH2 is in the para position? Maybe). Wait, perhaps more accurately, the CONH2 group is a substituent on benzene. Each benzene ring has 6 H. Substituting one H with CONH2 (so 5 H remaining on benzene) and then substituting another H with OCH2CH3 (ethoxy). So now, the benzene has 5 -1 = 4 H remaining, plus the H from CONH2 and ethoxy. Wait, CONH2 has two NH2 protons. But wait, in benzamide, the CONH2 is a substituent. So if benzamide is Ph-C(O)-NH2, then the original benzamide (before substitution) has: Benzene ring (5 H, since one position is occupied by C(O)NH2), then the CONH2 group has one H on the NH2 (since the other H is on the C=O?). Wait, no. The CONH2 group is a carboxamide. The structure is Ph-C(O)-NH2. The NH2 group has two H. So the H count for benzamide would be: Benzene ring with substituent at position 1 (CONH2). Therefore, the benzene ring has 5 H (positions 2,3,4,5,6). Wait, but adjacent to the CONH2 group (position 1), positions 2 and 6 (if para) would have H. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. But in any case, when you substitute another H (at position 3) with an ethoxy group, you lose one H and add the H from ethoxy (OCH2CH3), which has 2 CH2 groups and one CH3. So that's 2 + 2 + 3 = 7 H. So each ethoxy group adds 7 H. Original benzamide (C7H7NO2) has 7 H. After substituting with one ethoxy group, H count becomes 7 -1 +7 =13 H. But the formula given is C9H11NO2, which has 11 H. Therefore, this doesn't match. So my conclusion is that option D also doesn't fit. So the problem now is that none of the

okay, let's try to solve this problem. so, the question is about identifying a compound with the formula c9h11no2 using ir and 1h nmr data provided. the options are a to d. let's break down the information step by step.
first, let me recall what each type of spectroscopy tells us. ir spectroscopy gives information about functional groups based on the presence of certain absorption bands. the nmr, specifically 1h nmr here, gives details about the hydrogen environments and the structure's connectivity.
starting with the ir data: there are medium to strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. these are likely n–h stretching vibrations. the presence of two bands suggests some splitting, maybe due to hydrogen bonding or different amine environments. then there's a strong band at 1720 cm-1. that's typical for a carbonyl group (c=o). so the compound has a carbonyl and an amine group. the amine might be aromatic since amines on benzene rings can have different ir characteristics. the carbonyl at 1720 is probably from an ester, amide, or maybe a ketone. but given the formula has o and n, an ester or amide is more likely. wait, the molecular formula is c9h11no2. let's confirm that. the formula for each option would help. let me check later when considering the options. but first, let's parse the nmr data.
the 1h nmr data: 1.20 ppm (t, 3h); 4.0 ppm (bs, 2h); 4.5 ppm (q, 2h); 7.0 ppm (d, 2h); 8.0 ppm (d, 2h).
starting with the splitting patterns. a "t" is a triplet, "q" is a quartet, "d" is a doublet, and "s" is a singlet. but here, "bs" likely means broad singlet.
first, the signal at 1.20 ppm as a triplet (3h). that's probably a methyl group adjacent to a ch2. the triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. then 4.0 ppm, broad singlet (bs) for 2h. a broad peak could indicate exchange broadening, common for nh groups. so maybe two nh protons. wait, but maybe not necessarily—sometimes impurities or other factors. but amine protons can be broad. then 4.5 ppm, quartet (2h). quartet comes from coupling with three protons. so this would be a ch2 group next to a ch3. connecting the dots: 1.20 ppm triplet (3h) and 4.5 ppm quartet (2h)—this is typical for an ethyl group. the ethyl group has the ch3 at around 1.2 ppm (triplet) and the ch2 at around 4.5 ppm (quartet). the chemical shift of the ch2 is influenced by adjacent functional groups. if the ch2 is next to an oxygen, maybe in an ester or ether. the 4.5 ppm seems a bit upfield for an ester (like ethyl acetate has the ch2 around 4-4.5 ppm maybe?), but maybe. then the 7.0 and 8.0 ppm doublets. 7.0 ppm could be an och2 or possibly para-substituted aromatic protons. wait, but if there are two doublets for 2h each, that's four aromatic protons total. wait, but substituents on benzene rings can split the adjacent protons. for example, para-substituted benzene might have two doublets if there are two substituents? let's see. if the ring is substituted at the para position, say, with an ester and an amine, then the remaining aromatic protons could be split into two doublets. alternatively, maybe ortho or meta substituents causing certain splitting. but let's look at the chemical shifts. 7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm. for benzene rings, para-substituted protons (like in nitrobenzene) are around 7.5-8.0 ppm, but that can vary. however, if there is electron-withdrawing groups (ewg) like nitro or carbonyl, the protons are shifted upfield or downfield. wait, carbonyl groups adjacent would deshield the protons, moving them upfield or downfield? wait, downfield. so, if the aromatic protons are adjacent to a carbonyl, they would be at higher ppm. for example, in nitrobenzene, the proton is at 8.1 ppm. if there's an amine (electron donating group), it could cause the adjacent protons to be upfield. but in this case, the signals are at 7.0 and 8.0. so maybe the substituents are in para positions. let's imagine a benzene ring with two substituents: one is an ester or carbonyl group (pulling the protons downfield, so around 8.0 ppm) and another is an amine (which donates electrons, so the adjacent protons are upfield, like 7.0 ppm). alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in positions that the remaining protons are split into two doublets. but how? wait, another possibility is that the aromatic protons are split by coupling to adjacent protons, but usually, in a benzene ring, protons are split into multiplets unless there's symmetry. wait, if there are two doublets, each integrating to 2h, that suggests symmetry. for example, if the substituents are in the para positions, then the remaining two pairs of equivalent protons would each be adjacent to different substituents. wait, maybe not. let me think. if the benzene ring has substituents in positions 1 and 3 (meta), then the equivalent protons would be in positions 2, 4, 5, 6. but maybe that's not symmetrical. alternatively, if substituents are para, like positions 1 and 4, then the remaining protons would be in positions 2, 3, 5, 6. but these are not equivalent. wait, but maybe if the substituents are such that there are two pairs of equivalent protons. for instance, if the benzene ring has two substituents in the ortho positions, then maybe the remaining equivalent protons are in two doublets. wait, maybe not. alternatively, perhaps the aromatic protons are split by coupling to each other. in simple cases, like o-dichlorobenzene, you have two doublets. but that's when there are two adjacent cl atoms, so the protons are split. wait, perhaps in this case, the two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm each integrating to 2h could be two sets of equivalent protons. that would mean the aromatic ring has two different environments for the protons, each with two equivalent protons. this might happen if there's a substituent that breaks the symmetry. for example, if there is an ester group in the para position and another group in the meta position? hmm, maybe i need to think of specific structures.
alternatively, maybe the compound is a benzoate ester. let's see. option b is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. let's consider that structure. benzoate ester would have the ester group (cooet) on the benzene ring. the 4-aminobenzoate would have an amine group at position 4 (para) of the benzene ring, and the ester at position 1. wait, but if the ester is at position 1 (carboxylic acid becomes ester), then the amine is at position 4. so the benzene ring has cooet in position 1 and nh2 in position 4. then the aromatic protons would be split into two doublets. wait, in such a case, the ring would have substituents in positions 1 and 4. the protons adjacent to these substituents would be deshielded or shielded. but how many protons would be affected? if the cooet is in position 1 and nh2 in position 4, then the adjacent protons would be in positions 2 and 3 (next to cooet) and position 5 (next to nh2)? wait, positions 2 and 6? hmm, maybe. wait, let me draw the structure: benzene ring with substituents at positions 1 (cooet) and 4 (nh2). then the remaining aromatic protons would be in positions 2, 3, 5, and 6. however, due to the substituents in positions 1 and 4, the ring is symmetric. wait, but the substituents are in para positions, so the molecule is symmetric. therefore, positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and positions 3 and 5 would be equivalent. so that would give two doublets in the nmr. each doublet would correspond to two equivalent protons. the positions adjacent to the ester (positions 2 and 3) might have one set of chemical shifts, and positions 5 and 6 (adjacent to the amine) another. the ester is an electron-withdrawing group, so the adjacent protons (positions 2 and 3) would be deshielded, appearing downfield (higher ppm). the amine is electron-donating, so the adjacent protons (positions 5 and 6) would be upfield (lower ppm). but in the given nmr data, the doublets are at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. if the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the ester is at position 1, amine at position 4. the protons adjacent to the ester (position 2 and 3) would be around 8.0 ppm (due to deshielding by the ester), and the protons adjacent to the amine (position 5 and 6) would be upfield, maybe around 7.0 ppm. that would match the two doublets. then, the nmr would have these two doublets integrating to 2h each. so that part fits.
next, the ethyl group in the ester. the ester would have ch2ch3 attached. the ch2ch3 (ethyl group) would have a ch3 at around 1.2 ppm as a triplet (since it's ch2ch3, the ch3 is next to the ch2), and the ch2 at around 4.5 ppm as a quartet. that's exactly what is seen in the nmr data: 1.20 ppm (t, 3h) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2h). the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2h) would then correspond to the nh2 group. since the amine is attached to the aromatic ring (as in 4-aminobenzoate), the nh2 would be in a para position. aromatic amines can be broad in the nmr due to exchange broadening. so that matches. let's check the ir data. the ir shows medium to strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. these are likely n–h stretches, so the amine (nh2) is present. the splitting into two bands could be due to the amine being next to an electron-withdrawing group (the ester), causing hydrogen bonding. the strong band at 1720 cm-1 is the carbonyl stretch of the ester (cooet). so that all checks out. let's verify the molecular formula. the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. the benzoate part is from benzoic acid (c7h6o2). when converted to ethyl ester, the formula becomes c7h5o2 (from benzoate) + c2h5o (from ethyl group) — wait, no. wait, benzoic acid is c7h6o2. the ester would be c7h5o2 (benzoate) combined with ethanol (c2h6o), but the ester linkage removes a water molecule, so the ester part is -cooch2ch3. therefore, the total formula for ethyl benzoate is c7h5o2 (benzoate) + c2h5 (ethyl) = c9h10o2. but then adding the nh2 group (amine) replaces a hydrogen. wait, no. wait, benzoic acid is c7h6o2. if we substitute hydrogen with nh2, we get an amino group. wait, but when the benzoate is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the formula would be: the parent is benzoic acid (c7h6o2). replacing one h with nh2: becomes c7h5nh2o2. then forming the ethyl ester: replacing the cooh with cooch2ch3. so the formula would be: c7 (from benzene) + 5 h (remaining from benzene after substitution) + nh2 (1 n, 2 h) + cooch2ch3 (c2h5o2). wait, the cooch2ch3 group adds 2 o and 2 c and 5 h (the ethyl group is -o-ch2ch3: o, ch2ch3. so the ethyl group has 2 c, 5 h, and the o is part of the ester linkage). so total h: from benzene (originally 6 h; after substituting one h with cooch2ch3 and another with nh2, we have 4 h remaining on the ring) + 5 h from ethyl group? wait, maybe i need to count carefully. wait, the benzene ring has 6 c. in benzoic acid, it's -cooh. so when converting to ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the structure is: the benzene ring with substituents at positions 1 (cooch2ch3) and 4 (nh2). the benzene ring has 6 c. the cooch2ch3 adds 2 c (from the ethyl group) and the nh2 is just n and 2 h. so total carbons: benzene (6 c) + 2 c (from ethyl) = 8 c. wait, but the compound in question is c9h11no2. wait, according to the molecular formula given in the problem, it's c9h11no2. but according to my count for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: carbons: benzene (6) + 2 (from ethyl) = 8. but the compound is supposed to have 9 c. so that's an issue. wait, perhaps i'm missing something. wait, the benzoate ester would have: the benzene ring (6 c) plus the ethyl group in the ester (cooch2ch3). so the ester comes from benzoic acid (cooh group), replacing the oh with och2ch3. so the ethyl group is two carbons, making a total of 6 + 2 = 8 carbons. then, the remaining carbon must be from another group. wait, but the formula given is c9h11no2. that's 9 c, 11 h, 1 n, 2 o. so where is the ninth carbon? if the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, it should have 8 carbons. hence, this is a problem. therefore, option b is incorrect. so maybe my initial thought was wrong. alternatively, maybe the structure is different. let's consider other options. option a: 4-aminophenyl propionate. let's parse this. phenyl propionate would be a propionyl group attached to a benzene ring (as cooch2ch2ch3?), but i'm not sure. wait, "4-aminophenyl propionate" could mean that the benzene ring has an amino group at position 4 and a propionate ester (ch2ch2coo-) group at position 1? wait, but propionate is ch2ch2coo-. no, wait, propionic acid is ch2ch2cooh, so propionate would be ch2ch2coo-. so if it's 4-aminophenyl propionate, perhaps the benzene ring has an aminophenyl group (nh2c6h4-) attached to the propionate ester? hmm, maybe the structure is ch2ch2coo- substituted with a 4-aminophenyl group. alternatively, maybe it's a benzene ring with nh2 and a propionate group. let's see. but perhaps the formula would be: for propionic acid (ch2ch2cooh), forming an ester with a phenyl group. wait, maybe the structure is (4-aminophenyl) propionate, which would be propionic acid esterified with 4-aminophenyl. so the structure is: ph-nh2 → substituting one h of benzene with nh2, and another h with cooch2ch2ch3? wait, no. wait, propionate is the ch2ch2coo- group. so if it's 4-aminophenyl propionate, the propionate ester is on the 4-aminophenyl group. wait, perhaps the benzene ring has an nh2 group at position 4, and the cooch2ch2ch3 group at position 1. then, the molecular formula would be: benzene (6 c) + propyl group (3 c) in the ester. so 6 + 3 = 9 c. that matches the formula c9h11no2. let's see. the molecular formula for option a: 4-aminophenyl propionate. if the benzene ring has nh2 at position 4 and the propionate ester (cooch2ch2ch3) at position 1. then, the molecular formula would be: for benzene: 6 c. for propionate ester: cooch2ch2ch3. that's 3 c from the propyl chain (ch2ch2ch3). so total 6 + 3 = 9 c. nitrogen is present once from the amine. o is present twice: one from the carboxyl and one from the ester. so that's c9h??no2. wait, but let's calculate the hydrogen. wait, benzene with substituents: when you have a benzene ring with two substituents, each replacing a hydrogen. the original benzene has 6 h. if you substitute two positions, you lose two h, so remaining h on benzene is 4. then the propionate ester group is cooch2ch2ch3: the ester linkage adds o and the propyl group. the coo- would have the usual oxygen. the propyl group is ch2ch2ch3, which has 7 h (ch2 has 2 h, ch2 has 2 h, ch3 has 3 h). then, the nh2 group has 2 h. so total h: 4 (remaining on benzene) + 7 (propyl) + 2 (nh2) = 13 h. then, the formula would be c9h13no2. but the given formula is c9h11no2. so that doesn't match. hmm, maybe i'm miscalculating. wait, perhaps the propionate ester is (ch3ch2ch2coo-), which is n-propyl acetate? wait, propionate is -ch2ch2coo-. no, wait, propionic acid is ch3ch2cooh. therefore, propionate would be ch3ch2coo-. so if the ester is, say, methyl propionate (which is ch3ch2cooch3), but in this case, if it's phenyl propionate, then perhaps the ester is between the benzene ring and the propionate. wait, but if the benzene ring is substituted with nh2 and cooch2ch2ch3, then the total h would be different. wait, perhaps my mistake is in the propionate ester. let me check again: if the propionate ester is -o-ch2-ch2-cooph, where ph is the 4-aminophenyl group. wait, no. alternatively, if the structure is ph-coo-ch2-ch2-ch2-o-r? no, i'm getting confused. maybe i should look at another option. option c: n-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. let's break this down. formamide is hconh2, but substituted here. n-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide would be hconh-c6h4-och2ch3 (substituted on the benzene ring at position 4 with ethoxy). the molecular formula: formamide part is hconh2. but when substituted with 4-ethoxyphenyl, perhaps the structure is ph-c(o)-nh2, where ph is the 4-ethoxyphenyl. wait, no. wait, n-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide would be the formamide (hconh2) where one of the h on the nh2 is replaced by a 4-ethoxyphenyl group. so the structure would be o=c(nhph)h, where ph is the 4-ethoxyphenyl group. wait, formamide is hconh2. if we replace one h on the nh2 with a phenyl group, substituted at the 4-position with ethoxy. so the structure would be hconh-ph-ethoxy. so the molecular formula: the benzene (c6h5) with och2ch3 (ethoxy) at para and connected via n. so total carbons: 6 (benzene) + 2 (ethoxy) = 8 c. but the compound is supposed to have 9 c. therefore, the formamide part has one more carbon? wait, formamide is hconh2, which has 1 c. so total c: 6 (benzene) + 2 (ethoxy) + 1 (formamide c) = 9 c. okay, that's plausible. so the formula would be c9h??no2. let's calculate h: benzene with 4-ethoxy group: original benzene has 6 h. substituted at position 4 with och2ch3. so five positions left, each with one h (since substituted in para, the available positions are ortho and meta, but how does that affect h count?). wait, when you substitute one position on benzene with ethoxy, the number of h atoms on the benzene ring is reduced by one (from 6 to 5). then, the ethoxy group is och2ch3, which has 7 h (each ch3 and ch2). then, the formamide part is hconh-ph. the hconh- part has: the h (from formamide) and the ph would connect to n. so the hconh- would have one h on the carbonyl carbon, then the n is connected to the phenyl group and one h. so each hconh- would have one h (on the n) and one h (on the carbonyl). wait, formamide is hconh2, but in this case, substituted with phenyl: hconh-ph. therefore, the h on the carbonyl would still be present? wait, formamide has h2n-c(o)-h. if you replace one h on the nh with phenyl, you get ph-nh-c(o)-h. so that structure would still have an nh (one h) and a conh. wait, no. if formamide is hconh2, substituting one h with phenyl would give phconh2. wait, that's not n- substituted. wait, formamide is hconh2. if we substitute the n with a phenyl group, replacing one h, it's phconh2. that would be an acylamide. wait, but the question's option c is n-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. so formamide is hconh2. n-substituted would be hconr2. wait, no. formamide is hconh2. so n-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide would be hconhp where p is 4-ethoxyphenyl. wait, maybe the structure is o=c(nph)h2, but that can't be. wait, perhaps it's ph-n-c(o)-h. that would be formamide with one phenyl group. the structure would be: formamide (hconh2) where one h on the nh2 is replaced by a phenyl group. but that would be aryl formamide. so the structure would be ph-n-c(o)-h. then, the h on the carbonyl side is still present. the molecular formula would be: c6h5 (ph) + conh. wait, the conh would come from formamide. the conh group has 1 c, 1 o, 1 n, and one h. so the total would be: ph (6 c) + conh (1 c) = 7 c. but the compound is supposed to have 9 c. the 4-ethoxyphenyl group is ph-och2ch3. so the ethoxy group adds 2 c (och2ch3). therefore, total c: 6 (ph) + 2 (ethoxy) + 1 (formamide c) = 9 c. so the formula is c9h??no2. let's compute h: the benzene ring with ethoxy substituent: original 6 h on benzene, but substituting at 4 with och2ch3. so the benzene has 5 h left. the ethoxy group has 7 h (och2ch3: each ch3 is 3 h, ch2 is 2 h). then, the formamide part: hconh(ph). the hconh has one h on the carbonyl and one h on the nitrogen (since the other is the ph). so that's one h on carbonyl and one h on n. so total h: 5 (benzene) + 7 (ethoxy) + 1 (carbonyl h) + 1 (nh) = 14 h. but the given formula is c9h11no2. so 14 h is more than the required 11. therefore, this can't be correct. alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in substitution. wait, perhaps the structure is different. if the compound is n-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, maybe the formamide is attached to the benzene via the nitrogen. so the structure would be benzene ring with n attached, which is part of the formamide. wait, but formamide is hconh2. if n is bonded to the benzene ring, making it an aniline derivative with formamide group. wait, that would be different. let's clarify. if it's n-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, the structure should be: the formamide is hconh-ph, where ph is 4-ethoxyphenyl. so the hconh2 becomes hconh-ph, substituting one h on the nitrogen with the 4-ethoxyphenyl group. therefore, structure is o=c(nph)h, where ph is 4-ethoxyphenyl. in that case, the h on the nitrogen is lost, but the carbonyl has one h. then, the 4-ethoxyphenyl group is c6h4-och2ch3. so the h count on that group: c6h4 (since substituted with och2ch3). for c6h4-och2ch3: the benzene has 4 h (since two positions are substituted: one with och2ch3 and one with n... wait, but in this case, the nitrogen is part of the formamide. so if the benzene is c6h5n... wait, perhaps i'm mixing substituents. let me think again. if the formamide is hconh-ph, where ph is 4-ethoxyphenyl, then the benzene ring (as 4-ethoxyphenyl) has five substituents? no. wait, the 4-ethoxyphenyl group is a phenyl group with an ethoxy group in the 4-position. so the phenyl group has och2ch3 at position 4, and is attached via position 1 to the formamide. wait, but the attachment point for the "phenyl" group in n-aryl formamides is via the ring. so the 4-ethoxyphenyl group is a benzene ring with ethoxy at position 4, and the rest is attached at position 1 (the para position) to the nitrogen of the formamide. wait, maybe not. if the substituent is in the 4-position, then the attachment point of the formamide would be at the benzene's position 1, making the ethoxy group at position 4 relative to the attached formamide. maybe this is getting too complicated. let's just focus on the h count. suppose the benzene ring has an ethoxy group (och2ch3) and is attached to the formamide (o=c(nh)–ph–). the benzene ring would have four h if substituted in the 4-position. wait, benzene has 6 positions. if the substituent (ethoxy) is at position 4, and the formamide is attached at position 1 (as the aryl group in the formamide). wait, but how is that possible? the formamide is hconh-ph. the ph is aryl, which is a substituent. so the benzene ring is attached via a substituent (the aryl group) to the nitrogen in the formamide. therefore, the benzene ring has ethoxy at position 4, and the attachment to the formamide is at position 1. so the benzene ring has substituents at positions 1 and 4. therefore, the remaining positions 2, 3, 5, 6 each have one h. so benzene contributes 6 h (positions 2,3,5,6 and two more?), no, wait. if the benzene ring is substituted at positions 1 and 4, then each of those positions has a substituent. the remaining positions are 2,3,4,5,6. wait, no. each substituent is in one position. so substituting in positions 1 and 4 removes two h atoms from those positions. therefore, the remaining h on the benzene ring are 6 - 2 = 4 h. then, the ethoxy group (och2ch3) has 2 ch2 and one ch3. so the ethoxy group has 2 (from ch2) + 2 (from another ch2) + 3 (from ch3) = 7 h. the formamide part: o=c(nh-ph)h. so the carbonyl has one h (the other is connected to n), and the n has one h (since the other is connected to ph). so that's one h on carbonyl and one h on n. so total h: 4 (benzene) + 7 (ethoxy) + 1 (carbonyl) + 1 (nh) = 13 h. still more than the required 11. so this doesn't match. so option c is out.
option d: 3-ethoxybenzamide. let's consider this. benzamide is benzene carboxamide (conh2 substituent on benzene). if it's 3-ethoxybenzamide, then the benzene ring has an ethoxy group at position 3 and a carbamide (conh2) at position 1 (assuming numbering). wait, but when substituting, the positions would affect the nmr. let's see. the molecular formula for 3-ethoxybenzamide: benzamide (c7h7no2). then, substituting a ethoxy group (och2ch3) at position 3 would add 2 c and 5 h (?). wait, original benzamide is c7h7no2. if substituting one h with och2ch3, then the formula becomes: c7 (from benzamide) + 2 c (from ethoxy) = c9. so that matches. the h count would be: original benzamide has 7 h. when substituting a h with och2ch3, you lose one h and add 5 h (from och2ch3, which has 2 ch2 and one o. wait, och2ch3 has 2 ch2 groups (each with two h) and one ch3 (three h). so total 2 + 2 + 3 = 7 h. so substituting one h with och2ch3 adds 7 - 1 = 6 h. so original h is 7. then, substituting gives 7 + 6 = 13 h. but the formula given is c9h11no2, which has 11 h. so discrepancy here. so this can't be correct. hmm. alternatively, maybe the structure is different. if the benzamide is substituted with ethoxy at position 3, then perhaps the h count is different. wait, benzamide (conh2) is substituted on benzene. so substituting a h with och2ch3 would require replacing one h with och2ch3. so the molecule would be c9h11no2. wait, let's recalculate h: benzamide has the structure ph-c(o)-nh2. the parent benzamide (without substitution) has 7 h: 3 h on the benzene ring adjacent to the conh2 group, and 4 h on the other positions (since the conh2 is in the para position? maybe). wait, perhaps more accurately, the conh2 group is a substituent on benzene. each benzene ring has 6 h. substituting one h with conh2 (so 5 h remaining on benzene) and then substituting another h with och2ch3 (ethoxy). so now, the benzene has 5 -1 = 4 h remaining, plus the h from conh2 and ethoxy. wait, conh2 has two nh2 protons. but wait, in benzamide, the conh2 is a substituent. so if benzamide is ph-c(o)-nh2, then the original benzamide (before substitution) has: benzene ring (5 h, since one position is occupied by c(o)nh2), then the conh2 group has one h on the nh2 (since the other h is on the c=o?). wait, no. the conh2 group is a carboxamide. the structure is ph-c(o)-nh2. the nh2 group has two h. so the h count for benzamide would be: benzene ring with substituent at position 1 (conh2). therefore, the benzene ring has 5 h (positions 2,3,4,5,6). wait, but adjacent to the conh2 group (position 1), positions 2 and 6 (if para) would have h. wait, maybe i'm overcomplicating. but in any case, when you substitute another h (at position 3) with an ethoxy group, you lose one h and add the h from ethoxy (och2ch3), which has 2 ch2 groups and one ch3. so that's 2 + 2 + 3 = 7 h. so each ethoxy group adds 7 h. original benzamide (c7h7no2) has 7 h. after substituting with one ethoxy group, h count becomes 7 -1 +7 =13 h. but the formula given is c9h11no2, which has 11 h. therefore, this doesn't match. so my conclusion is that option d also doesn't fit. so the problem now is that none of the
