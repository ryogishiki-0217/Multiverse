Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step.
The question is about finding the angular distance between the first two minima in the far-field diffraction pattern of a monochromatic light passing through an N-sided polygonal aperture with all apothems of length 'a'.
And it specifies that N is infinitely large, which probably means the polygon becomes a circle.
Let's think in parallel.

<Goal>
<Outline>
1: Recall the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture (Airy pattern) and identify the angular positions of its minima.

2: Recall the angular distance between the first two minima for a circular aperture.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: Wait, so when N approaches infinity, the aperture turns into a circular one.
So maybe we need to use the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture, which is the Airy pattern.
The minima of the Airy pattern occur at certain angles given by the formula related to the Bessel function J1.
Specifically, the minima happen where J1(β) = 0, and the first few zeros are at approximately β ≈ 3.8317, 7.0156, 10.1735, etc.

2: The angular distance between the first and second minima is then 3.832λ/(πD) - 1.220λ/(πD) ≈ (2.612/π)λ/D ≈ 0.832λ/D. This seems inconsistent with the given answer options, which are around 0.5 to 1.22 times λ/a. Perhaps the formula is different for a polygon with infinite sides.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The first minima for a circular aperture are at β ≈ 3.8317, 7.0156, etc., leading to an angular distance between the first two minima of about 0.832λ/D. This does not match the provided options.

But the problem mentions apothems of length 'a'.
For a regular polygon, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of one of the sides.
As N increases, the apothem approaches the radius of the circumscribed circle.
But maybe in this case, they consider the apothem to be equivalent to the radius?
Wait, no.
The apothem 'a' for a regular polygon with N sides is related to the circumradius R by the formula a = R * cos(π/N).
When N is infinite, cos(π/N) ≈ 1 - (π/N)2/2, but in the limit as N approaches infinity, cos(π/N) approaches 1, so a approaches R.
So for an infinitely large N, the apothem 'a' is essentially the radius R of the circle.
Therefore, if we model the aperture as a circular one with radius a, then the diffraction pattern is the Airy pattern.
The angular position of the first minimum (which is the first dark ring) is given by θ = 1.22 * λ / D, where D is the diameter.
But wait, in terms of the radius, since θ = 1.22 * λ / (2a), because D = 2a.
Wait, no.
Let me check.
The formula for the first minimum of the Airy pattern is θ = 1.22 * λ / D, where D is the diameter of the aperture.
If the radius is a, then D = 2a, so θ = 1.22 * λ / (2a) = 0.61 * λ / a.
Wait, that's answer D: 0.610 λ / a.
But the question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima.
Wait, hold on.
If the first minimum is at θ = 1.22 * λ / D, then the second minimum is at the next zero of the Bessel function.
The zeros of J1 are at approximately 3.8317, 7.0156, 10.1735, etc.
So the first minimum is at β = 3.8317, the second is at 7.0156.
The angular position is given by θ = β * λ / (π D).
Wait, maybe I need to use the actual formula instead of the approximation.
The approximate formula for the first minimum is θ ≈ 1.22 * λ / D.
But if N is infinite, the aperture is circular, so we use the Airy pattern.
The first minimum is at θ = 1.22 * λ / D.
The second minimum is at approximately θ ≈ 2.24 * λ / D.
But I need to recall the exact positions.
The first few zeros of J1 occur at approximately:
First zero: 3.8317
Second zero: 7.0156
Third zero: 10.1735
So the general formula for the minima in the Airy pattern is θ = (β_m) * λ / D, where β_m are the roots of the Bessel function J1(β) = 0.
So the first minimum is at 3.8317 * λ / D.
Wait, no.
Wait, the formula for the angular radius of the minima in the Airy pattern is given by:
θ_m = (β_m / D) * λ
Wait, no, let me check again.
The equation for the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is given by the intensity:
I(θ) = (I_0 * (2 J1(β) / β)^2 )
Where β = (π D θ) / λ
The minima occur where J1(β) = 0.
So the roots of J1(β) are the locations of the minima.
So setting J1(β) = 0, the roots are β = 3.8317, 7.0156, 10.1735, etc.
Therefore, β = π D θ / λ.
So solving for θ:
θ = (β / π D) * λ
Therefore, the angular position of each minima is θ_m = (β_m / π D) * λ
Therefore, the first minima occurs at θ_1 = (3.8317 / π D) * λ
Second minima at θ_2 = (7.0156 / π D) * λ
Therefore, the angular distance between the first and second minima is θ_2 - θ_1 = (7.0156 - 3.8317)/ (π D) * λ ≈ 3.1841 / (π D) * λ
But D is the diameter, which is 2a.
So substituting D = 2a:
θ_diff ≈ 3.1841 / (π * 2a) * λ ≈ 3.1841 / (6.2832a) * λ ≈ 0.506 / a * λ
So the angular distance between the first two minima is approximately 0.506 λ / a.
Which is option C.
Wait, but let's confirm this.
Let me do the calculation step by step.
Compute the difference between the second root and the first root of J1:
β_2 - β_1 = 7.0156 - 3.8317 = 3.1839
Then, the angular difference is:
Δθ = (β_2 - β_1) * λ / (π D)
Since D = 2a, then:
Δθ = (3.1839 / (π * 2a)) * λ
Calculate the coefficient:
3.1839 / (2 * π) ≈ 3.1839 / 6.2832 ≈ 0.506
Therefore, Δθ ≈ 0.506 λ / a.
So the answer is C.
But wait, the problem states that when N is infinitely large, so the aperture is circular, and asks for the angular distance between the first two minima.
So according to this calculation, it's 0.506 λ /a, which is option C.
However, I need to confirm why the answer isn't 1.22 λ/D, which is sometimes called the Rayleigh criterion.
But no, the Rayleigh criterion is for the resolution between two points, whereas here it's the angular distance between the first two minima in the diffraction pattern of a single circular aperture.
So the first minimum is at 1.22 λ/D, the second is at approximately (7.0156 / π) * (λ / D) ≈ 2.24 λ/D.
Therefore, the separation between the first and second minima would be 2.24 - 1.22 = 1.02 λ/D, but that's not what we have here.
Wait, no.
Let's be precise.
From the actual roots:
θ1 = 3.8317 * λ / (π D) ≈ 1.2196 * λ / D ≈ 1.22 λ / D (as the first minimum)
θ2 = 7.0156 * λ / (π D) ≈ 2.237 λ / D
Therefore, the difference is θ2 - θ1 ≈ 2.237 λ/D - 1.2196 λ/D ≈ 1.0174 λ/D.
But D is 2a, so λ/D = λ/(2a).
Therefore, 1.0174 λ/D = 1.0174 * λ/(2a) ≈ 0.5087 λ/a.
Which is approximately 0.506 λ/a as calculated before (close to 0.5087, but the precise value depends on the precision of the subtraction).
Given that 3.1839 / (2π) is exactly (7.0156 - 3.8317)/(2π).
Let me compute it:
Compute numerator: 7.0156 - 3.8317 = 3.1839
Denominator: 2π ≈ 6.2832
3.1839 / 6.2832 ≈ 0.506.
Therefore, 0.506 λ / a.
So the answer is C.
But wait, looking at the options, C is 0.506 λ / a.
So yes, that's correct.
But why in some resources, I've read that the separation between the first two minima in the Airy pattern is approximately 1.02 λ/D.
But here, D is 2a, so 1.02 λ/(2a) = 0.51 λ/a, which is roughly the same as 0.506.
So this approximation is consistent.
Therefore, the correct answer should be C.
But let me check again.
If N is infinite, the aperture is a circle.
The problem says when N is infinitely large, so we need to compute the angular distance between the first two minima in the Airy pattern.
The first minima occur at θ ≈ 1.22 λ/D and the second at θ ≈ 2.24 λ/D.
Therefore, the difference is approximately 1.02 λ/D.
Since D = 2a, then 1.02 λ/(2a) = 0.51 λ/a.
Given the options, the closest one is C) 0.500 λ/a or C) 0.506 λ/a?
The exact value is approximately 0.506, so C.
Therefore, the answer is C.
**Final Answer** 
\boxed{C}
</Think>

Answer: The problem involves determining the angular distance between the first two minima in the far-field diffraction pattern of a monochromatic light passing through an N-sided polygonal aperture with apothems of length \( a \). As \( N \) approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle with radius \( a \).

1. **Aperture Shape**: For an infinitely large \( N \), the aperture becomes a circular aperture with radius \( a \). The diameter \( D \) of this circle is \( 2a \).

2. **Diffraction Pattern**: The diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is the Airy pattern. The minima in this pattern occur at specific angles given by the roots of the Bessel function \( J_1(\beta) = 0 \).

3. **Roots of Bessel Function**: The first two roots of \( J_1(\beta) = 0 \) are approximately \( \beta_1 \approx 3.8317 \) and \( \beta_2 \approx 7.0156 \).

4. **Angular Position of Minima**: The angular position \( \theta \) of these minima is given by:
   \[
   \theta_m = \frac{\beta_m}{\pi D} \lambda
   \]
   where \( \beta_m \) are the roots, \( D = 2a \), and \( \lambda \) is the wavelength.

5. **Calculating Angular Distance**:
   - First minimum: \( \theta_1 = \frac{3.8317}{\pi \cdot 2a} \lambda \)
   - Second minimum: \( \theta_2 = \frac{7.0156}{\pi \cdot 2a} \lambda \)
   - Angular distance between the first two minima:
     \[
     \Delta \theta = \theta_2 - \theta_1 = \frac{7.0156 - 3.8317}{\pi \cdot 2a} \lambda
     \]
   - Simplifying the coefficient:
     \[
     \frac{3.1839}{6.2832} \approx 0.506
     \]
   - Therefore, the angular distance is approximately \( 0.506 \frac{\lambda}{a} \).

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{C}\).

answer: the problem involves determining the angular distance between the first two minima in the far-field diffraction pattern of a monochromatic light passing through an n-sided polygonal aperture with apothems of length \( a \). as \( n \) approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle with radius \( a \).

1. **aperture shape**: for an infinitely large \( n \), the aperture becomes a circular aperture with radius \( a \). the diameter \( d \) of this circle is \( 2a \).

2. **diffraction pattern**: the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is the airy pattern. the minima in this pattern occur at specific angles given by the roots of the bessel function \( j_1(\beta) = 0 \).

3. **roots of bessel function**: the first two roots of \( j_1(\beta) = 0 \) are approximately \( \beta_1 \approx 3.8317 \) and \( \beta_2 \approx 7.0156 \).

4. **angular position of minima**: the angular position \( \theta \) of these minima is given by:
   \[
   \theta_m = \frac{\beta_m}{\pi d} \lambda
   \]
   where \( \beta_m \) are the roots, \( d = 2a \), and \( \lambda \) is the wavelength.

5. **calculating angular distance**:
   - first minimum: \( \theta_1 = \frac{3.8317}{\pi \cdot 2a} \lambda \)
   - second minimum: \( \theta_2 = \frac{7.0156}{\pi \cdot 2a} \lambda \)
   - angular distance between the first two minima:
     \[
     \delta \theta = \theta_2 - \theta_1 = \frac{7.0156 - 3.8317}{\pi \cdot 2a} \lambda
     \]
   - simplifying the coefficient:
     \[
     \frac{3.1839}{6.2832} \approx 0.506
     \]
   - therefore, the angular distance is approximately \( 0.506 \frac{\lambda}{a} \).

thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{c}\)
