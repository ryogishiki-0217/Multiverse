Okay, so I need to solve this problem about estimating the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds in deep space, based on their detection with optical ground-based telescopes.
Let me think step by step.
First, I remember that neutral hydrogen emits and absorbs light at the Lyman-alpha wavelength, which is approximately 1216 Angstroms.
But since these are clouds absorbing light from background quasars, we're dealing with absorption lines.
The key here is that optical ground-based telescopes can only detect certain wavelengths.
Ground-based telescopes typically observe in the optical range, which is roughly from about 3000 Angstroms (ultraviolet edge) to 11000 Angstroms (near-infrared).
However, the atmosphere blocks some wavelengths, so the effective range is more like 3200 Angstroms (near-ultraviolet) to about 10000 Angstroms (near-infrared).
But I need to confirm this.
Wait, the Lyman-alpha line is at 1216 Angstroms, which is in the ultraviolet.
But the atmosphere blocks ultraviolet light, right?
So if the hydrogen clouds are at some redshift, the Lyman-alpha wavelength gets redshifted into the optical range.
So the question is: what's the minimum redshift at which the Lyman-alpha absorption line is still in the observable optical window for ground-based telescopes.
So first, I need to recall that redshift (z) causes wavelengths to be stretched by a factor of (1 + z).
So if the rest wavelength is λ0 = 1216 Angstroms, the observed wavelength λ is λ = λ0 * (1 + z).
The question is, what's the smallest z such that λ is still in the optical window.
Since the atmosphere blocks UV below around 3000 Angstroms, but I think the actual optical window for ground-based is more like 3200 Angstroms and above?
Wait, maybe I should check the atmospheric cutoff.
The Earth's atmosphere is mostly transparent in the optical window from approximately 300 nm (3000 Angstroms) to 1100 nm (11000 Angstroms).
However, the atmospheric absorption is significant below around 320 nm (3200 Angstroms), so practical optical telescopes start observing around 330 nm (3300 Angstroms) onwards.
But Lyman-alpha is at 1216 Angstroms (121.6 nm), which is in the far ultraviolet, completely blocked by the atmosphere.
So when the problem says "optical ground-based telescopes", we can assume they can't observe below about 3000 Angstroms or so.
Therefore, the redshift must be high enough that 1216*(1 + z) >= 3000 Angstroms.
Wait, but maybe the optical window starts at a bit higher?
For instance, 3200 or 3500?
I need to get this right.
Let me think.
The atmospheric cutoff for the Earth's atmosphere is around 300 nm (3000 Angstroms), but there's still a lot of absorption even above that.
Practically, telescopes can observe starting around 320 nm (3200 Angstroms) in the near-ultraviolet.
So maybe the lower limit for optical is considered 3200 Angstroms.
So if the Lyman-alpha line (1216 Angstroms) is redshifted to at least 3200 Angstroms, then it can be detected.
So setting up the equation: 1216*(1 + z) = 3200.
Solving for z: (1 + z) = 3200 / 1216 ≈ 2.63
Therefore, z ≈ 1.63.
But this is if the lower limit is 3200 Angstroms.
However, the options given are 1.2, 2.4, 1.9, and 3.
1.63 is not among them, so maybe my assumption about the lower limit is incorrect.
Wait, but some sources say that ground-based telescopes can observe down to about 3000 Angstroms with difficulty, maybe 2900?
Let's see, if we take 3000 Angstroms, then (1 + z) = 3000 / 1216 ≈ 2.468, so z ≈ 1.468.
Still not matching the options.
Alternatively, maybe the problem considers the atmospheric cutoff at 3600 Angstroms?
Let's see: 1216*(1 + z) = 3600.
(1 + z) ≈ 2.96, z ≈ 1.96, which is close to option C) 1.9.
Hmm.
Alternatively, sometimes people consider 4000 Angstroms as the near-ultraviolet limit for optical telescopes.
But 1216*(1 + z) = 4000 would give (1 + z) ≈ 3.3, z ≈ 2.3, which is option B.
Wait, but that seems too high.
Wait, the problem states "optical ground-based telescopes".
The optical spectrum is commonly considered to be from about 400 nm (4000 Angstroms) to 700 nm (7000 Angstroms).
But if something is redshifted beyond 4000 Angstroms (from 1216 Angstroms), that would require a redshift of (4000 - 1216)/1216 = (4000/1216) -1 ≈ 3.3 -1 = 2.3, so z=2.3.
But that would be if the optical window starts at 4000 Angstroms, which is in the blue part.
But ground-based telescopes can observe into the near-UV, so perhaps down to 3000 Angstroms?
I need to check.
Let me think again.
The Lyman-alpha forest is a series of absorption lines in the spectra of high-redshift quasars, caused by neutral hydrogen in intergalactic medium.
Typically, these are seen at redshifts z > 2, where the Ly-alpha line is shifted into the optical window.
Wait, but maybe for the Ly-alpha line to be detectable, the redshift must be high enough so that the line is in the optical range.
So the rest frame Ly-alpha is at 1216 Angstroms.
If we want this line to be in the optical (say, longer than 3000 Angstroms), then the minimum redshift would be (3000 / 1216) -1 ≈ 1.47.
But this isn't an option here.
However, the given options are 1.2, 2.4, 1.9, 3.
None of which is 1.47.
Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the atmosphere doesn't transmit well below 3600 Angstroms?
For example, the IUE satellite could observe down to 1150 Angstroms, but ground-based is limited.
Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to the fact that the atmosphere is opaque below approximately 3800 Angstroms?
No, that's not right.
Let me check some facts.
The atmospheric ozone layer absorbs wavelengths shorter than about 300 nm (3000 Angstroms), but there's also absorption from other constituents like molecular oxygen and nitrogen.
However, with modern telescopes and instruments, observations in the near-UV (around 3200 Angstroms) are possible.
For example, the MMT telescope with the Blue Channel can go down to 3200 Angstroms.
The problem is asking for a lower limit on the redshift such that the objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.
So if a telescope can detect down to 3200 Angstroms, then 1216*(1 + z) = 3200, which gives z ≈ 1.63.
But again, this is not an option.
Alternatively, maybe the problem considers the optical range starting at 4000 Angstroms.
Then 1216*(1 + z) = 4000 gives z ≈ 2.3, which is close to option B.
But why would they take 4000 Angstroms as the lower limit?
Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the fact that for ground-based observations, the atmospheric extinction at wavelengths shorter than 350 nm (3500 Angstroms) is quite high, so practical observations are done at longer wavelengths.
So if we take 3500 Angstroms, 1216*(1 + z) = 3500 → (1 + z) ≈ 2.887, z ≈ 1.887, which is approximately 1.9, option C.
So maybe that's it.
If they use 3500 Angstroms as the lower limit where the atmospheric extinction is low enough for detection, then z ≈ 1.9.
Alternatively, maybe the problem is using 3600 Angstroms, which would be 1216*(1 + z) = 3600, (1 + z) ≈ 2.96, z ≈ 1.96, which is also ~1.96, so option C) 1.9.
Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the redshift where the Ly-alpha line moves from the UV into the optical, which is considered starting at ~3646 Angstroms (which is the hydrogen-alpha line, but that's irrelevant).
But 3646 Angstroms would give (1 + z) = 3646/1216 ≈ 3, so z ≈ 2.
Wait, but that's z=2.
Then the answer would be D) 3?
No, if z=2, then the observed wavelength is 1216*(1+2)=3648 Angstroms, which is about 3650 Angstroms, which is in the near-UV.
But maybe some telescopes can go that low.
But if we take higher z, like z=3, then the wavelength is 1216*4=4864 Angstroms, which is in the blue optical.
But the question is about the lower limit on the redshift so that they can be detected.
So the minimal z where the wavelength is just in the optical.
So if the optical is considered starting at 4000 Angstroms, then z=(4000/1216) -1 ≈ 2.3, option B.
But how do different sources define the optical window?
Let me recall: the optical window is generally considered to be from about 400 nm (4000 Angstroms) to 700 nm (7000 Angstroms).
However, ground-based telescopes can sometimes observe a bit below 400 nm, into the near-UV.
For example, 350 nm (3500 Angstroms) is in the near-UV, and some telescopes can reach there with suitable detectors.
So perhaps the problem is considering that the optical window for ground-based is from 3000 to 11000 Angstroms, but with significant atmospheric absorption below 3500 Angstroms.
Therefore, to be detected easily, the wavelength should be above, say, 3500 Angstroms.
Then z=(3500/1216) -1 ≈ 1.96, so approximately 1.96, which is closest to option C) 1.9.
Alternatively, if we take 3600 Angstroms, then z=(3600/1216)-1 ≈ 1.968, so again ~1.96.
Therefore, the answer should be C) 1.9.
But let me check another angle.
The Lyman-alpha forest is typically seen in quasar spectra at redshifts z > 2.
But why?
Because at z=2, the Ly-alpha line is at 1216*(1+2)=3648 Angstroms, which is in the near-UV.
However, quasars at higher redshifts would have their Ly-alpha line blueshifted into the UV, but in absorption, the forest is seen up to the Lyman limit.
Wait, maybe not.
Wait, in emission, the Ly-alpha line is at 1216*(1+z).
In absorption, like the Lyman-alpha forest, it's the same.
The forest consists of many absorption lines from neutral hydrogen clouds at various redshifts between us and the quasar.
Each cloud causes an absorption line at (1+z) scaled wavelength.
So the closest cloud (lowest z) would have the longest wavelength absorption line.
To detect these lines with optical telescopes, the lines must be shifted into the optical window.
So if the optical window is, say, 3000-11000 Angstroms, then the minimum z is such that 1216*(1+z) >= 3000.
As before, which gives z ~1.47.
But this isn't one of the options.
The options given are A)1.2, B)2.4, C)1.9, D)3.
The closest would be C)1.9.
Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that to be detected, the wavelength needs to be in the range where the atmosphere is transparent, which is from approximately 3000 Angstroms upwards with increasing transmission.
But since the problem asks for a lower limit on the redshift, it's the minimal redshift required such that the line is in the optical.
If we take the Lyman-alpha wavelength of 1216 Angstroms and set the observed wavelength to be 3000 Angstroms, then z=(3000/1216)-1≈1.47.
But again, this isn't an option.
Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the fact that for ground-based detection, the atmosphere's airglow and other factors limit the ability to detect lines below certain wavelengths.
For example, the night sky background in the near-UV (3200-3800 Angstroms) is higher, making it difficult to detect faint objects.
So perhaps the effective lower limit for reliable detection is higher, like 3500 Angstroms.
In that case, z=(3500/1216)-1≈1.96, which is ~1.96, so answer C)1.9.
Alternatively, maybe 4000 Angstroms is considered the lower limit of the optical band where detection is straightforward, so z=(4000/1216)-1≈2.3, which is option B.
But the problem states "optical ground-based telescopes", and the optical spectrum is typically 400-700 nm.
However, if the telescope can do near-UV, then 300-400 nm (3000-4000 Angstroms) is sometimes included.
But without specific information, I need to go with standard assumptions.
Alternatively, perhaps the standard optical window is considered to be 3200-10400 Angstroms.
So if the line is at 3200 Angstroms, z=(3200/1216)-1≈1.63.
Not an option.
Wait, the question is about the lower limit on the redshift.
That is, the minimal redshift at which the object can be detected.
So if the telescope can't see wavelengths shorter than, say, 3500 Angstroms, then the Ly-alpha line at 1216*(1+z) must be at least 3500 Angstroms.
Solving 1216*(1+z)=3500 gives z≈(3500/1216) -1≈2.05.
Hmm, around 2.05.
But the options closest would be C)1.9 or B)2.4.
If the cutoff is 3500 Angstroms, the answer is around 2.05.
But since 1.9 is closer to this value, but not exactly.
Alternatively, maybe the problem uses a different wavelength for the Ly-alpha transition.
Wait, the exact wavelength is 1215.67 Angstroms.
But using 1216 is okay.
Alternatively, perhaps the answer is B)2.4.
Let's check.
If z=2.4, then the observed wavelength is 1216*(1+2.4)=1216*3.4=4134.4 Angstroms.
That's in the blue optical.
But why would the lower limit be 2.4?
That doesn't make sense.
The lower limit should be the minimal z where the line is in the optical.
So if optical is considered starting at 3000 Angstroms, minimal z is ~1.47.
Not an option.
If considering starting at 3500, it's ~2.05.
If starting at 4000, it's ~2.3.
So none of the options fit exactly.
The given options are A)1.2, B)2.4, C)1.9, D)3.
If I consider that the problem might be referring to the fact that the Earth's atmosphere is transparent in the optical range (approximately 300-1100 nm), but due to airglow and other factors, observations below 350 nm (3500 Angstroms) are difficult.
So if the cutoff is 3500 Angstroms, solving 1216*(1+z)=3500 gives z≈(3500/1216) -1≈1.96.
That's approximately 1.96, which is closest to option C)1.9.
So that might be the answer.
Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the maximal redshift for which the line is in the optical is when the wavelength is 11000 Angstroms.
But that's for the upper limit.
The question is about the lower limit on the redshift.
Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the minimal z such that the entire Lyman-alpha forest (from z until the object's z) is within the optical.
But that's more complicated.
No, the question states "the lower limit on the redshift of these objects such that they can be detected".
So each object (neutral hydrogen cloud) causes an absorption line at 1216*(1+z).
To be detected with optical telescopes, that wavelength must be in the optical window.
So the minimal z for which 1216*(1+z) is in the optical.
If optical is 3000-11000 Angstroms, then minimal z is (3000/1216)-1≈1.47.
But since 1.47 is not an option, perhaps the answer is C)1.9.
Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the optical window starts at 3300 Angstroms.
Then z=(3300/1216)-1≈1.71.
Not an option.
Wait, given the available options, and considering that many sources consider the optical window to start at approximately 350 nm (3500 Angstroms) for ground-based telescopes, then z=(3500/1216)-1≈1.96≈1.9.
Hence, option C.
Another angle: the Lyman-alpha forest is typically observed in quasars with z > 2.
But why?
Because at z~2, the Lyman-alpha wavelength is around 3646 Angstroms (1216*(1+2)).
This is in the near-UV.
But ground-based telescopes can observe down to ~3000 Angstroms.
Wait, if a quasar is at redshift z=2, then its Lyman-alpha line is at 1216*(1+2)=3646 Angstroms.
But if the cloud's redshift is lower, like z=1.9, then the observed wavelength would be 1216*(1+1.9)=1216*2.9=3526 Angstroms.
Which is still in the near-UV, but if the telescope can detect down to 3500 Angstroms, then it's detectable.
So if the minimal z is 1.9, then the wavelength is 3526 Angstroms.
If that's the lower limit of detectability, then z=1.9 is the answer.
So maybe the answer is C)1.9.
Alternatively, if the telescope can only detect up to 11000 Angstroms, then the upper redshift limit would be higher, but the question is about the lower limit.
So regardless of higher z, the minimal z needed is such that the line is in the optical.
So given that, and given that 3500 Angstroms cutoff makes z≈1.9, and that's option C, I think that's the answer.
Let me check if there's any other factor.
For example, the problem says "lower limit on the redshift of these objects".
So the objects themselves (the hydrogen clouds) have a redshift.
The absorption lines are seen against the quasar's spectrum, so the quasar must be at a higher redshift than the cloud.
But the question is about the redshift of the clouds.
So the lower limit on the clouds' redshift such that they can be detected.
So regardless of the quasar's redshift, the cloud's z must be high enough that the 1216 Angstrom absorption is shifted into the optical.
So if the minimal optical wavelength is 3000 Angstroms, z=(3000/1216)-1≈1.47.
But if minimal is 3500, z≈1.96.
So maybe 1.96, closest to 1.9.
Hence, option C.
Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the entire Lyman series is above the vacuum cutoff.
But no, other lines in the Lyman series are even shorter wavelength.
Alternatively, the problem could be considering the fact that the Lyman-alpha forest is seen in quasars with z > 2, but why?
No, the forest can be seen in quasars at z > 2 because there are intervening clouds between us and the quasar.
The forest extends up to the quasar's redshift.
So the lowest redshift clouds (i.e., closest to us) would have the highest observed wavelength.
If the quasar is at z=4, then the Lyman-alpha line would be at 1216*(1+4)=6080 Angstroms.
The forest would show absorption lines from z=0 up to z=4.
The lines closest to us (z~0) would be at long wavelengths.
But if the cloud is at z=1.9, the observed wavelength would be 1216*(1+1.9)=3526 Angstroms.
If the telescope can detect that wavelength, then the cloud at z=1.9 is detectable.
So if this is the minimal z, then that's the answer.
But why is the minimal z 1.9?
Because below z=1.9, the wavelength is below the telescope's capability.
So if the telescope can go down to 3500 Angstroms, then z=(3500/1216)-1≈1.96.
So 1.9 is the closest option.
Alternatively, if the minimal detectable wavelength is 3650 Angstroms, z=(3650/1216)-1≈2.0.
But that's not an option.
So given the available options, and considering common sense that optical telescopes can go down to roughly 3500 Angstroms, answer C)1.9 is the best fit.
Thus, I think the answer is C.
**Final Answer**
\boxed{C}
</Think>

Answer: To estimate the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds detectable with optical ground-based telescopes, we need to consider the redshift required for the Lyman-alpha wavelength (1216 Å) to be within the optical window of these telescopes. 

Optical ground-based telescopes can generally detect wavelengths from approximately 3000 Å (near-ultraviolet) to 11000 Å (near-infrared). However, due to atmospheric absorption and airglow, the effective lower limit is often around 3500 Å for reliable detection.

The formula to calculate the observed wavelength due to redshift is:
\[ \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_0 (1 + z) \]
where \(\lambda_0 = 1216\) Å (Lyman-alpha wavelength), and \(\lambda_{\text{obs}}\) is the observed wavelength.

To find the minimum redshift \(z\) such that the observed wavelength is at least 3500 Å:
\[ 1216 (1 + z) = 3500 \]
\[ 1 + z = \frac{3500}{1216} \]
\[ z \approx 1.96 \]

The closest option to this calculated value is 1.9.

Thus, the lower limit on the redshift of the objects such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes is \(\boxed{C}\).

but i need to confirm this.
wait, the lyman-alpha line is at 1216 angstroms, which is in the ultraviolet.
but the atmosphere blocks ultraviolet light, right?
so if the hydrogen clouds are at some redshift, the lyman-alpha wavelength gets redshifted into the optical range.
so the question is: what's the minimum redshift at which the lyman-alpha absorption line is still in the observable optical window for ground-based telescopes.
so first, i need to recall that redshift (z) causes wavelengths to be stretched by a factor of (1 + z).
so if the rest wavelength is λ0 = 1216 angstroms, the observed wavelength λ is λ = λ0 * (1 + z).
the question is, what's the smallest z such that λ is still in the optical window.
since the atmosphere blocks uv below around 3000 angstroms, but i think the actual optical window for ground-based is more like 3200 angstroms and above?
wait, maybe i should check the atmospheric cutoff.
the earth's atmosphere is mostly transparent in the optical window from approximately 300 nm (3000 angstroms) to 1100 nm (11000 angstroms).
however, the atmospheric absorption is significant below around 320 nm (3200 angstroms), so practical optical telescopes start observing around 330 nm (3300 angstroms) onwards.
but lyman-alpha is at 1216 angstroms (121.6 nm), which is in the far ultraviolet, completely blocked by the atmosphere.
so when the problem says "optical ground-based telescopes", we can assume they can't observe below about 3000 angstroms or so.
therefore, the redshift must be high enough that 1216*(1 + z) >= 3000 angstroms.
wait, but maybe the optical window starts at a bit higher?
for instance, 3200 or 3500?
i need to get this right.
let me think.
the atmospheric cutoff for the earth's atmosphere is around 300 nm (3000 angstroms), but there's still a lot of absorption even above that.
practically, telescopes can observe starting around 320 nm (3200 angstroms) in the near-ultraviolet.
so maybe the lower limit for optical is considered 3200 angstroms.
so if the lyman-alpha line (1216 angstroms) is redshifted to at least 3200 angstroms, then it can be detected.
so setting up the equation: 1216*(1 + z) = 3200.
solving for z: (1 + z) = 3200 / 1216 ≈ 2.63
therefore, z ≈ 1.63.
but this is if the lower limit is 3200 angstroms.
however, the options given are 1.2, 2.4, 1.9, and 3.
1.63 is not among them, so maybe my assumption about the lower limit is incorrect.
wait, but some sources say that ground-based telescopes can observe down to about 3000 angstroms with difficulty, maybe 2900?
let's see, if we take 3000 angstroms, then (1 + z) = 3000 / 1216 ≈ 2.468, so z ≈ 1.468.
still not matching the options.
alternatively, maybe the problem considers the atmospheric cutoff at 3600 angstroms?
let's see: 1216*(1 + z) = 3600.
(1 + z) ≈ 2.96, z ≈ 1.96, which is close to option c) 1.9.
hmm.
alternatively, sometimes people consider 4000 angstroms as the near-ultraviolet limit for optical telescopes.
but 1216*(1 + z) = 4000 would give (1 + z) ≈ 3.3, z ≈ 2.3, which is option b.
wait, but that seems too high.
wait, the problem states "optical ground-based telescopes".
the optical spectrum is commonly considered to be from about 400 nm (4000 angstroms) to 700 nm (7000 angstroms).
but if something is redshifted beyond 4000 angstroms (from 1216 angstroms), that would require a redshift of (4000 - 1216)/1216 = (4000/1216) -1 ≈ 3.3 -1 = 2.3, so z=2.3.
but that would be if the optical window starts at 4000 angstroms, which is in the blue part.
but ground-based telescopes can observe into the near-uv, so perhaps down to 3000 angstroms?
i need to check.
let me think again.
the lyman-alpha forest is a series of absorption lines in the spectra of high-redshift quasars, caused by neutral hydrogen in intergalactic medium.
typically, these are seen at redshifts z > 2, where the ly-alpha line is shifted into the optical window.
wait, but maybe for the ly-alpha line to be detectable, the redshift must be high enough so that the line is in the optical range.
so the rest frame ly-alpha is at 1216 angstroms.
if we want this line to be in the optical (say, longer than 3000 angstroms), then the minimum redshift would be (3000 / 1216) -1 ≈ 1.47.
but this isn't an option here.
however, the given options are 1.2, 2.4, 1.9, 3.
none of which is 1.47.
alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the atmosphere doesn't transmit well below 3600 angstroms?
for example, the iue satellite could observe down to 1150 angstroms, but ground-based is limited.
wait, perhaps the problem is referring to the fact that the atmosphere is opaque below approximately 3800 angstroms?
no, that's not right.
let me check some facts.
the atmospheric ozone layer absorbs wavelengths shorter than about 300 nm (3000 angstroms), but there's also absorption from other constituents like molecular oxygen and nitrogen.
however, with modern telescopes and instruments, observations in the near-uv (around 3200 angstroms) are possible.
for example, the mmt telescope with the blue channel can go down to 3200 angstroms.
the problem is asking for a lower limit on the redshift such that the objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.
so if a telescope can detect down to 3200 angstroms, then 1216*(1 + z) = 3200, which gives z ≈ 1.63.
but again, this is not an option.
alternatively, maybe the problem considers the optical range starting at 4000 angstroms.
then 1216*(1 + z) = 4000 gives z ≈ 2.3, which is close to option b.
but why would they take 4000 angstroms as the lower limit?
alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the fact that for ground-based observations, the atmospheric extinction at wavelengths shorter than 350 nm (3500 angstroms) is quite high, so practical observations are done at longer wavelengths.
so if we take 3500 angstroms, 1216*(1 + z) = 3500 → (1 + z) ≈ 2.887, z ≈ 1.887, which is approximately 1.9, option c.
so maybe that's it.
if they use 3500 angstroms as the lower limit where the atmospheric extinction is low enough for detection, then z ≈ 1.9.
alternatively, maybe the problem is using 3600 angstroms, which would be 1216*(1 + z) = 3600, (1 + z) ≈ 2.96, z ≈ 1.96, which is also ~1.96, so option c) 1.9.
alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the redshift where the ly-alpha line moves from the uv into the optical, which is considered starting at ~3646 angstroms (which is the hydrogen-alpha line, but that's irrelevant).
but 3646 angstroms would give (1 + z) = 3646/1216 ≈ 3, so z ≈ 2.
wait, but that's z=2.
then the answer would be d) 3?
no, if z=2, then the observed wavelength is 1216*(1+2)=3648 angstroms, which is about 3650 angstroms, which is in the near-uv.
but maybe some telescopes can go that low.
but if we take higher z, like z=3, then the wavelength is 1216*4=4864 angstroms, which is in the blue optical.
but the question is about the lower limit on the redshift so that they can be detected.
so the minimal z where the wavelength is just in the optical.
so if the optical is considered starting at 4000 angstroms, then z=(4000/1216) -1 ≈ 2.3, option b.
but how do different sources define the optical window?
let me recall: the optical window is generally considered to be from about 400 nm (4000 angstroms) to 700 nm (7000 angstroms).
however, ground-based telescopes can sometimes observe a bit below 400 nm, into the near-uv.
for example, 350 nm (3500 angstroms) is in the near-uv, and some telescopes can reach there with suitable detectors.
so perhaps the problem is considering that the optical window for ground-based is from 3000 to 11000 angstroms, but with significant atmospheric absorption below 3500 angstroms.
therefore, to be detected easily, the wavelength should be above, say, 3500 angstroms.
then z=(3500/1216) -1 ≈ 1.96, so approximately 1.96, which is closest to option c) 1.9.
alternatively, if we take 3600 angstroms, then z=(3600/1216)-1 ≈ 1.968, so again ~1.96.
therefore, the answer should be c) 1.9.
but let me check another angle.
the lyman-alpha forest is typically seen in quasar spectra at redshifts z > 2.
but why?
because at z=2, the ly-alpha line is at 1216*(1+2)=3648 angstroms, which is in the near-uv.
however, quasars at higher redshifts would have their ly-alpha line blueshifted into the uv, but in absorption, the forest is seen up to the lyman limit.
wait, maybe not.
wait, in emission, the ly-alpha line is at 1216*(1+z).
in absorption, like the lyman-alpha forest, it's the same.
the forest consists of many absorption lines from neutral hydrogen clouds at various redshifts between us and the quasar.
each cloud causes an absorption line at (1+z) scaled wavelength.
so the closest cloud (lowest z) would have the longest wavelength absorption line.
to detect these lines with optical telescopes, the lines must be shifted into the optical window.
so if the optical window is, say, 3000-11000 angstroms, then the minimum z is such that 1216*(1+z) >= 3000.
as before, which gives z ~1.47.
but this isn't one of the options.
the options given are a)1.2, b)2.4, c)1.9, d)3.
the closest would be c)1.9.
alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that to be detected, the wavelength needs to be in the range where the atmosphere is transparent, which is from approximately 3000 angstroms upwards with increasing transmission.
but since the problem asks for a lower limit on the redshift, it's the minimal redshift required such that the line is in the optical.
if we take the lyman-alpha wavelength of 1216 angstroms and set the observed wavelength to be 3000 angstroms, then z=(3000/1216)-1≈1.47.
but again, this isn't an option.
alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the fact that for ground-based detection, the atmosphere's airglow and other factors limit the ability to detect lines below certain wavelengths.
for example, the night sky background in the near-uv (3200-3800 angstroms) is higher, making it difficult to detect faint objects.
so perhaps the effective lower limit for reliable detection is higher, like 3500 angstroms.
in that case, z=(3500/1216)-1≈1.96, which is ~1.96, so answer c)1.9.
alternatively, maybe 4000 angstroms is considered the lower limit of the optical band where detection is straightforward, so z=(4000/1216)-1≈2.3, which is option b.
but the problem states "optical ground-based telescopes", and the optical spectrum is typically 400-700 nm.
however, if the telescope can do near-uv, then 300-400 nm (3000-4000 angstroms) is sometimes included.
but without specific information, i need to go with standard assumptions.
alternatively, perhaps the standard optical window is considered to be 3200-10400 angstroms.
so if the line is at 3200 angstroms, z=(3200/1216)-1≈1.63.
not an option.
wait, the question is about the lower limit on the redshift.
that is, the minimal redshift at which the object can be detected.
so if the telescope can't see wavelengths shorter than, say, 3500 angstroms, then the ly-alpha line at 1216*(1+z) must be at least 3500 angstroms.
solving 1216*(1+z)=3500 gives z≈(3500/1216) -1≈2.05.
hmm, around 2.05.
but the options closest would be c)1.9 or b)2.4.
if the cutoff is 3500 angstroms, the answer is around 2.05.
but since 1.9 is closer to this value, but not exactly.
alternatively, maybe the problem uses a different wavelength for the ly-alpha transition.
wait, the exact wavelength is 1215.67 angstroms.
but using 1216 is okay.
alternatively, perhaps the answer is b)2.4.
let's check.
if z=2.4, then the observed wavelength is 1216*(1+2.4)=1216*3.4=4134.4 angstroms.
that's in the blue optical.
but why would the lower limit be 2.4?
that doesn't make sense.
the lower limit should be the minimal z where the line is in the optical.
so if optical is considered starting at 3000 angstroms, minimal z is ~1.47.
not an option.
if considering starting at 3500, it's ~2.05.
if starting at 4000, it's ~2.3.
so none of the options fit exactly.
the given options are a)1.2, b)2.4, c)1.9, d)3.
if i consider that the problem might be referring to the fact that the earth's atmosphere is transparent in the optical range (approximately 300-1100 nm), but due to airglow and other factors, observations below 350 nm (3500 angstroms) are difficult.
so if the cutoff is 3500 angstroms, solving 1216*(1+z)=3500 gives z≈(3500/1216) -1≈1.96.
that's approximately 1.96, which is closest to option c)1.9.
so that might be the answer.
alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the maximal redshift for which the line is in the optical is when the wavelength is 11000 angstroms.
but that's for the upper limit.
the question is about the lower limit on the redshift.
alternatively, if the problem is asking for the minimal z such that the entire lyman-alpha forest (from z until the object's z) is within the optical.
but that's more complicated.
no, the question states "the lower limit on the redshift of these objects such that they can be detected".
so each object (neutral hydrogen cloud) causes an absorption line at 1216*(1+z).
to be detected with optical telescopes, that wavelength must be in the optical window.
so the minimal z for which 1216*(1+z) is in the optical.
if optical is 3000-11000 angstroms, then minimal z is (3000/1216)-1≈1.47.
but since 1.47 is not an option, perhaps the answer is c)1.9.
alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the optical window starts at 3300 angstroms.
then z=(3300/1216)-1≈1.71.
not an option.
wait, given the available options, and considering that many sources consider the optical window to start at approximately 350 nm (3500 angstroms) for ground-based telescopes, then z=(3500/1216)-1≈1.96≈1.9.
hence, option c.
another angle: the lyman-alpha forest is typically observed in quasars with z > 2.
but why?
because at z~2, the lyman-alpha wavelength is around 3646 angstroms (1216*(1+2)).
this is in the near-uv.
but ground-based telescopes can observe down to ~3000 angstroms.
wait, if a quasar is at redshift z=2, then its lyman-alpha line is at 1216*(1+2)=3646 angstroms.
but if the cloud's redshift is lower, like z=1.9, then the observed wavelength would be 1216*(1+1.9)=1216*2.9=3526 angstroms.
which is still in the near-uv, but if the telescope can detect down to 3500 angstroms, then it's detectable.
so if the minimal z is 1.9, then the wavelength is 3526 angstroms.
if that's the lower limit of detectability, then z=1.9 is the answer.
so maybe the answer is c)1.9.
alternatively, if the telescope can only detect up to 11000 angstroms, then the upper redshift limit would be higher, but the question is about the lower limit.
so regardless of higher z, the minimal z needed is such that the line is in the optical.
so given that, and given that 3500 angstroms cutoff makes z≈1.9, and that's option c, i think that's the answer.
let me check if there's any other factor.
for example, the problem says "lower limit on the redshift of these objects".
so the objects themselves (the hydrogen clouds) have a redshift.
the absorption lines are seen against the quasar's spectrum, so the quasar must be at a higher redshift than the cloud.
but the question is about the redshift of the clouds.
so the lower limit on the clouds' redshift such that they can be detected.
so regardless of the quasar's redshift, the cloud's z must be high enough that the 1216 angstrom absorption is shifted into the optical.
so if the minimal optical wavelength is 3000 angstroms, z=(3000/1216)-1≈1.47.
but if minimal is 3500, z≈1.96.
so maybe 1.96, closest to 1.9.
hence, option c.
alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the entire lyman series is above the vacuum cutoff.
but no, other lines in the lyman series are even shorter wavelength.
alternatively, the problem could be considering the fact that the lyman-alpha forest is seen in quasars with z > 2, but why?
no, the forest can be seen in quasars at z > 2 because there are intervening clouds between us and the quasar.
the forest extends up to the quasar's redshift.
so the lowest redshift clouds (i.e., closest to us) would have the highest observed wavelength.
if the quasar is at z=4, then the lyman-alpha line would be at 1216*(1+4)=6080 angstroms.
the forest would show absorption lines from z=0 up to z=4.
the lines closest to us (z~0) would be at long wavelengths.
but if the cloud is at z=1.9, the observed wavelength would be 1216*(1+1.9)=3526 angstroms.
if the telescope can detect that wavelength, then the cloud at z=1.9 is detectable.
so if this is the minimal z, then that's the answer.
but why is the minimal z 1.9?
because below z=1.9, the wavelength is below the telescope's capability.
so if the telescope can go down to 3500 angstroms, then z=(3500/1216)-1≈1.96.
so 1.9 is the closest option.
alternatively, if the minimal detectable wavelength is 3650 angstroms, z=(3650/1216)-1≈2.0.
but that's not an option.
so given the available options, and considering common sense that optical telescopes can go down to roughly 3500 angstroms, answer c)1.9 is the best fit.
thus, i think the answer is c.
**final answer**
\boxed{c}
</think>

answer: to estimate the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds detectable with optical ground-based telescopes, we need to consider the redshift required for the lyman-alpha wavelength (1216 å) to be within the optical window of these telescopes. 

optical ground-based telescopes can generally detect wavelengths from approximately 3000 å (near-ultraviolet) to 11000 å (near-infrared). however, due to atmospheric absorption and airglow, the effective lower limit is often around 3500 å for reliable detection.

the formula to calculate the observed wavelength due to redshift is:
\[ \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_0 (1 + z) \]
where \(\lambda_0 = 1216\) å (lyman-alpha wavelength), and \(\lambda_{\text{obs}}\) is the observed wavelength.

to find the minimum redshift \(z\) such that the observed wavelength is at least 3500 å:
\[ 1216 (1 + z) = 3500 \]
\[ 1 + z = \frac{3500}{1216} \]
\[ z \approx 1.96 \]

the closest option to this calculated value is 1.9.

thus, the lower limit on the redshift of the objects such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes is \(\boxed{c}\)
