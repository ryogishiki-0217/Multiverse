Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, we have a density matrix ρ given by (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|), and we need to determine its geometrical position in qubits space. The options are A) (1,1,0), B) (0,0,0), C) (0,0,1), D) (1,1,1). Hmm, first I need to recall how density matrices relate to the geometric representation of qubits.
I remember that qubits can be represented on a Bloch sphere, which is a geometric representation where each point inside or on the sphere corresponds to a different quantum state. The Bloch vector specifies the position of the state in this space. For a general qubit state, the density matrix can be expressed in terms of the Pauli matrices and the identity matrix.
Let me recall the general form of a single-qubit density matrix. It can be written as: ρ = (I + r · σ) / 2, where r is the Bloch vector with components (x, y, z), and σ represents the vector of Pauli matrices (σx, σy, σz). So the Bloch vector components are related to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. Specifically, x = Tr(σx ρ), y = Tr(σy ρ), z = Tr(σz ρ). So to find the Bloch vector for the given density matrix, I need to compute the expectation values of σx, σy, and σz.
Given ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Let me first simplify this. |0><0| and |1><1| are the projectors onto the computational basis states. So adding them together and multiplying by 1/2 gives a diagonal matrix with 1/2 in each diagonal entry. In matrix form, ρ would be: [ [1/2, 0], [0, 1/2] ]. Wait, is that right? |0><0| is [ [1,0], [0,0] ] and |1><1| is [ [0,0], [0,1] ]. Adding them together gives [ [1,0], [0,1] ], and multiplying by 1/2 gives [ [1/2, 0], [0, 1/2] ]. So ρ is a diagonal matrix with 1/2s on the diagonal. That's the same as (1/2) I, right? Because the identity matrix is [ [1,0], [0,1] ], so (1/2) I is [ [1/2, 0], [0, 1/2] ]. Wait, but then ρ = (1/2) I. So the density matrix is just the identity matrix scaled by 1/2. But in the Bloch representation, ρ = (I + r · σ)/2. If ρ is (1/2) I, then that would imply: (1/2) I = (I + r · σ)/2 => I = I + r · σ => r · σ = 0. So the Bloch vector components must all be zero. Because σ matrices are off-diagonal here, so the only way for r · σ to be zero is if r = (0,0,0). But that would make ρ = (I + 0)/2 = (1/2) I, which matches. Wait, but that would mean the Bloch vector is (0,0,0), which is option B. But let me verify this step by step.
First, compute the Bloch vector components. For x, y, z, they are given by the trace of ρ multiplied by each Pauli matrix. Since ρ = (1/2) I, let's compute Tr(ρ σx). Tr( (1/2) I * σx ) = (1/2) Tr(σx). But the trace of σx is 0 because it's [ [0,1],[1,0] ], so diagonals sum to 0. Similarly, Tr(σy) and Tr(σz) are both 0. So each of the components x, y, z would be (1/2) * 0 = 0. Therefore, the Bloch vector is (0,0,0). That points to the center of the Bloch sphere. Therefore, the answer is B.
But wait, let me check again. The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Is that really (1/2) I? Let's write out the matrix components. |0><0| is diag(1,0), |1><1| is diag(0,1). Adding them gives diag(1,1), then times 1/2 gives diag(1/2, 1/2), which is (1/2) I. So yes, that's correct. Therefore, the density matrix is proportional to the identity, meaning it's a completely mixed state. On the Bloch sphere, the completely mixed state (which is (1/2) I for a qubit) corresponds to the center, i.e., the Bloch vector (0,0,0). Because for pure states, the Bloch vector lies on the surface of the sphere (radius 1), and mixed states are inside. The completely mixed state has the smallest possible Bloch vector, which is zero.
Therefore, the answer should be B) r=(0,0,0). But let me check the other options. For example, if ρ was a pure state like |0><0|, then its Bloch vector would be (0,0,1), because |0> is at the north pole. If ρ was (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2, which is a mixed state, being a classical mixture of |0> and |1>, but with no quantum coherence. So classically, 50-50 mixture. In the Bloch sphere, this would be represented as the center because there's no偏振in any direction. Alternatively, if you had a state like (|0> + |1>)/√2, then that would be a state with Bloch vector (1,0,0). But since here, the density matrix is 1/2 times the identity, so all coherence terms are zero, and populations are uniform. Therefore, the Bloch vector is zero. So the answer is B.

Answer: To determine the geometrical position of the given density matrix \(\rho = \frac{1}{2}(|0\rangle\langle0| + |1\rangle\langle1|)\) in qubit space, we need to find its Bloch vector coordinates \((x, y, z)\). 

The density matrix \(\rho\) is diagonal with entries \(\frac{1}{2}\) on the diagonal, which simplifies to:
\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{1}{2} I
\]
where \(I\) is the identity matrix. 

The Bloch vector components are calculated using the expectation values of the Pauli matrices \(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), and \(\sigma_z\):
- \(x = \text{Tr}(\sigma_x \rho)\)
- \(y = \text{Tr}(\sigma_y \rho)\)
- \(z = \text{Tr}(\sigma_z \rho)\)

Since \(\rho = \frac{1}{2} I\), multiplying by any Pauli matrix (which have trace zero) results in a trace of zero:
\[
\text{Tr}(\sigma_x \cdot \frac{1}{2} I) = \frac{1}{2} \text{Tr}(\sigma_x) = 0
]
Similarly, \(\text{Tr}(\sigma_y \rho) = 0\) and \(\text{Tr}(\sigma_z \rho) = 0\).

Thus, the Bloch vector components are all zero, indicating the state is at the center of the Bloch sphere.

The final answer is \(\boxed{B}\).

first, compute the bloch vector components. for x, y, z, they are given by the trace of ρ multiplied by each pauli matrix. since ρ = (1/2) i, let's compute tr(ρ σx). tr( (1/2) i * σx ) = (1/2) tr(σx). but the trace of σx is 0 because it's [ [0,1],[1,0] ], so diagonals sum to 0. similarly, tr(σy) and tr(σz) are both 0. so each of the components x, y, z would be (1/2) * 0 = 0. therefore, the bloch vector is (0,0,0). that points to the center of the bloch sphere. therefore, the answer is b.

answer: to determine the geometrical position of the given density matrix \(\rho = \frac{1}{2}(|0\rangle\langle0| + |1\rangle\langle1|)\) in qubit space, we need to find its bloch vector coordinates \((x, y, z)\). 

the density matrix \(\rho\) is diagonal with entries \(\frac{1}{2}\) on the diagonal, which simplifies to:
\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{1}{2} i
\]
where \(i\) is the identity matrix. 

the bloch vector components are calculated using the expectation values of the pauli matrices \(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), and \(\sigma_z\):
- \(x = \text{tr}(\sigma_x \rho)\)
- \(y = \text{tr}(\sigma_y \rho)\)
- \(z = \text{tr}(\sigma_z \rho)\)

since \(\rho = \frac{1}{2} i\), multiplying by any pauli matrix (which have trace zero) results in a trace of zero:
\[
\text{tr}(\sigma_x \cdot \frac{1}{2} i) = \frac{1}{2} \text{tr}(\sigma_x) = 0
]
similarly, \(\text{tr}(\sigma_y \rho) = 0\) and \(\text{tr}(\sigma_z \rho) = 0\).

thus, the bloch vector components are all zero, indicating the state is at the center of the bloch sphere.

the final answer is \(\boxed{b}\)
