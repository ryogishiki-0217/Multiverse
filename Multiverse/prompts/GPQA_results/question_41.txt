Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in glass when the glass is moving. The question is: A light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory? They also specify that the speed of light in vacuum, c, is 1. The answer choices are A) 1, B) (1 + n*v)/(n + v), C) (1 + n*v)/(n - v), D) (1 - n*v)/(n + v).
First, I need to recall how the speed of light in a medium relates to the medium's motion. Normally, the speed of light in a medium at rest relative to the observer is c/n, where c is the speed in vacuum. But here, the glass is moving. So, I think I need to consider the velocity addition formula from special relativity because velocities combine differently in relativity. However, I'm not sure if the standard velocity addition formula applies directly here since the light is moving through the glass, which is moving. Maybe I need to use the Fresnel drag coefficient? Wait, in the 19th century, Fresnel proposed that light traveling through a moving medium would experience a drag, which would explain the results of the Fizeau experiment. The formula for the Fresnel drag is that the speed of light in the moving medium is equal to c/n + (1 - 1/n2)v, where v is the velocity of the medium. But I need to check that formula again. Alternatively, if we use relativistic addition of velocities, but the medium is moving, so the light's velocity in the medium's frame is c/n, and then we need to add the velocity of the medium to get the velocity in the lab frame. But in special relativity, velocities don't add linearly. The relativistic formula for adding velocities is u = (u' + v)/(1 + u'v/c2), where u' is the velocity in the moving frame, and v is the velocity of the frame relative to the lab. But here, the speed of light in the glass (which is moving at v) is c/n. So, substituting, we get u = (c/n + v)/(1 + (c/n)v/c2). Simplifying the denominator, since c is in the numerator and denominator, that becomes (c/n + v)/(1 + v/n). But given that c=1 in the problem, let me substitute c=1. Then, the formula becomes: u = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + v/n). Let me compute that again. So, u' = 1/n (since c=1), and v is the velocity of the frame (glass) relative to lab. So applying the formula: u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'v). Since c=1, all velocities are normalized by c, so u' would be 1/n. Therefore: u = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n)v ). Which is ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + v/n). Then, if I factor 1/n out from the numerator and denominator: Numerator: (1/n)(1 + n v) Denominator: (1/n)(n + v) Wait, no. Wait: Wait, let me see. Let's write the numerator as (1/n + v). That can be written as (1 + n v)/n. Because: Take (1/n + v) = (1 + n v)/n. Similarly, the denominator: 1 + (v/n) = (n + v)/n. Therefore, putting them together: u = [(1 + n v)/n ] / [(n + v)/n] = (1 + n v)/(n + v). Therefore, the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame is (1 + n v)/(n + v). So, looking at the answer choices, that's option B. But wait, let me check again. The options are: B) (1 + n*v)/(n + v) C) (1 + n*v)/(n - v) D) (1 - n*v)/(n + v) Wait, but if the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, toward the observer, then the velocity addition would result in a speed that's higher than c/n? But since the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is propagating in the same direction as the glass's motion, the speed of light in the lab frame should be higher than c/n. Let's think: In the rest frame of the glass, the light moves at c/n. But if the glass is moving towards the observer in the lab frame, then the light is moving with the glass, so its speed relative to the lab should be higher. So, if v is positive in the direction of the beam, then the speed in the lab frame should be c/n + v, but relativistically combined. But according to the velocity addition formula, since the glass is moving at velocity v, and the light is moving at velocity c/n relative to the glass, then the formula is indeed (c/n + v)/(1 + (c/n) v/c2). With c=1, that's (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n). Then simplifying, multiplying numerator and denominator by n: (1 + n v)/(n + v n). Wait, wait, no. Wait, let's re-simplify: ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (v)(1/n) ) Multiply numerator and denominator by n: Numerator: 1 + n v Denominator: n + v So, the result is (1 + n v)/(n + v). Therefore, answer B. But wait, does this make sense? If n is 1, the index of refraction of vacuum, then the speed should be c, which is 1. Let's test n=1. Substituting n=1 into the expression: (1 + 1*v)/(1 + v) = (1 + v)/(1 + v) = 1, which is correct. So, that's good. So, if the medium is vacuum (n=1), the speed is c=1, regardless of the motion. But in this problem, since n >1, glass has n>1. Let's take n=2, for example, and v=0.5 (units of c, since c=1). Then the speed would be (1 + 2*0.5)/(2 + 0.5)= (1 +1)/2.5=2/2.5=0.8. So, 0.8c. But if the glass is moving at 0.5c, and the light is moving at c/n=0.5c in the glass frame, then in the lab frame, the speed should be higher because the glass is moving in the same direction. Wait, but 0.5c relative to the glass, which is moving at 0.5c relative to lab. So non-relativistically, it would be 0.5 + 0.5=1c, but relativistic addition gives (0.5 + 0.5)/(1 + 0.5*0.5)=1 /1.25=0.8c. Which matches. But according to the formula we derived, (1 + n v)/(n + v). So n=2, v=0.5: (1 + 2*0.5)/(2 +0.5)= (1 +1)/(2.5)=2/2.5=0.8. So that works. If the velocity was opposite, if the glass was moving against the light, then the formula would be different? But in this problem, it's moving in the same direction. So the answer is B. But let me check if there's another approach. Another way is using the relativistic Doppler effect. If the source (the light emitter) is moving towards the observer, the observed frequency is higher, but that might not affect the speed of light propagation. Wait, but the question is about the speed of the light beam, not the frequency or wavelength. So velocity addition is the correct approach here. Alternatively, thinking of the aether drag hypothesis, but that's outdated. Or the modern relativistic explanation that the speed of light in the moving medium is different. But according to special relativity, the velocity addition must hold. Therefore, I think the correct answer is B. The other options: If it was (1 +nv)/(n -v), that would be if velocities subtract, but since the glass is moving towards, and the light is moving in the same direction, denominator n - v would be lower, leading to higher speed, but that's not the case in relativistic addition. For example, in our test case with n=2 and v=0.5, option C would give (1 +1)/(2 -0.5)=2/1.5≈1.33 which is faster than light, so impossible. Similarly, option D gives negative, so no. Thus, the answer must be B.

Answer: To determine the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The speed of light in the glass (index of refraction \( n \)) moving at velocity \( v \) is given by:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

Given \( c = 1 \), this simplifies to:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}} = \frac{1 + nv}{n + v}
\]

This result is verified by checking the case when \( n = 1 \) (vacuum), yielding \( u = 1 \). For consistency with relativistic principles and testing with sample values, the derived formula correctly accounts for the velocity addition. Thus, the correct answer is:

\boxed{B}

if n is 1, the index of refraction of vacuum, then the speed should be c, which is 1. let's test n=1. substituting n=1 into the expression: (1 + 1*v)/(1 + v) = (1 + v)/(1 + v) = 1, which is correct. so, that's good. so, if the medium is vacuum (n=1), the speed is c=1, regardless of the motion. but in this problem, since n >1, glass has n>1. let's take n=2, for example, and v=0.5 (units of c, since c=1). then the speed would be (1 + 2*0.5)/(2 + 0.5)= (1 +1)/2.5=2/2.5=0.8. so, 0.8c. but if the glass is moving at 0.5c, and the light is moving at c/n=0.5c in the glass frame, then in the lab frame, the speed should be higher because the glass is moving in the same direction. wait, but 0.5c relative to the glass, which is moving at 0.5c relative to lab. so non-relativistically, it would be 0.5 + 0.5=1c, but relativistic addition gives (0.5 + 0.5)/(1 + 0.5*0.5)=1 /1.25=0.8c. which matches. but according to the formula we derived, (1 + n v)/(n + v). so n=2, v=0.5: (1 + 2*0.5)/(2 +0.5)= (1 +1)/(2.5)=2/2.5=0.8. so that works. if the velocity was opposite, if the glass was moving against the light, then the formula would be different? but in this problem, it's moving in the same direction. so the answer is b. but let me check if there's another approach. another way is using the relativistic doppler effect. if the source (the light emitter) is moving towards the observer, the observed frequency is higher, but that might not affect the speed of light propagation. wait, but the question is about the speed of the light beam, not the frequency or wavelength. so velocity addition is the correct approach here. alternatively, thinking of the aether drag hypothesis, but that's outdated. or the modern relativistic explanation that the speed of light in the moving medium is different. but according to special relativity, the velocity addition must hold. therefore, i think the correct answer is b. the other options: if it was (1 +nv)/(n -v), that would be if velocities subtract, but since the glass is moving towards, and the light is moving in the same direction, denominator n - v would be lower, leading to higher speed, but that's not the case in relativistic addition. for example, in our test case with n=2 and v=0.5, option c would give (1 +1)/(2 -0.5)=2/1.5≈1.33 which is faster than light, so impossible. similarly, option d gives negative, so no. thus, the answer must be b.
