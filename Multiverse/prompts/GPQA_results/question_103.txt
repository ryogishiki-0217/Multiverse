Alright, let's tackle this organic chemistry problem. The question is about the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. The answer is one of the four reaction sequences provided. Hmm, okay. Let me break down the target molecule first to understand what functional groups and substitutions are needed.
The target compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the structure is a ketone (ethan-1-one is acetophenone, right?) attached to a substituted phenyl group. The substituents on the phenyl ring are bromine at the 3-position and nitro at the 5-position relative to the ketone. Let me visualize the benzene ring: the ketone is at position 1, then the bromine is at 3 and nitro at 5. Wait, in substituting positions, when you have a ketone (or acyl group) on the benzene ring, that's a meta-directing group. But once substituted, the directing effects might change. But maybe the synthesis doesn't rely entirely on directing effects but uses nitration and bromination steps at specific positions. Let me think step by step.
Starting with benzene, the first goal is to introduce the necessary substituents. The target molecule has a nitro group and a bromine atom on the ring, plus an acetophenone group. Let's recall the common reactions:
- Nitration of benzene with HNO3/H2SO4 (option A's first step is nitration, as is option C and D's steps later). The position of nitration depends on existing substituents.
- Acylation with acetyl chloride (CH3COCl) under AlCl3 catalysis would form acetophenone. Alternatively, Friedel-Crafts acylation.
- Bromination with Br2/FeBr3 is a typical electrophilic substitution.
- The steps involving Fe/HCl might be for hydrogenation or maybe dehalogenation? Wait, Fe/HCl is a catalyst for dehydrohalogenation or maybe it's for substituting a nitro group? Wait, wait. Wait, Fe/HCl could be for the reduction of nitro groups to amino groups? Wait, to convert nitrobenzene to aniline, you use H2/Pd or sometimes Fe + HCl. Wait, the reaction of nitro compounds with Fe/HCl might be a reduction. But Fe/HCl is a catalyst for hydrogenation? Wait, in nitration, sometimes after nitration, to remove a nitro group, you might use reduction, but here the target has a nitro group, so maybe they are nitrating first, then doing other steps. Wait, let's look at the sequences.
The target molecule has both bromo and nitro groups. Nitration is usually done with HNO3, often with H2SO4 as a catalyst. Bromination with Br2/FeBr3. The sequence of these additions is important because each substitution directs the next. Let's think about the directing effects: nitro groups are meta directors, while bromine (as an electrophilic substituent) is para/ortho director. Wait, but when there are two substituents, the direction of the next substituent depends on both. But maybe the synthesis uses a stepwise approach with nitration and bromination at specific positions.
Moreover, the acetophenone group (the ketone) is also a substituent. Friedel-Crafts acylation would introduce an acyl group (in this case, acetyl) to the benzene ring. However, Friedel-Crafts is susceptible to side reactions if there are electron-withdrawing groups like nitro. The nitro group deactivates the ring and makes Friedel-Crafts acylation unfavorable. So perhaps the acylation step needs to happen before nitration? Because once the nitro group is added, the ring becomes less reactive. Alternatively, maybe the acylation is done after nitration but with some directing. Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let's look at the options.
Looking at the options:
Option A: Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4), then Fe/HCl, then acylation, then bromination, then nitration again, then diazotization (NaNO2/HCl), and finally reduction with H3PO2.
Wait, diazotization is usually after converting to an amino group. So Fe/HCl after nitration might be to reduce the nitro group to amino. Then diazotization would require conversion to nitroso, but H3PO2 is a reducing agent. Wait, H3PO2 is used in the reduction of diazonium salts, perhaps for replacement with hydrogen or other groups. Maybe the sequence is nitrating first, then reducing the nitro to amino, then acylating, then brominating, then nitration again? That seems complicated.
Option B: Nitration, then Fe/HCl, diazotization, reduction with H3PO2, bromination, acylation, nitration again. Hmm, also complex.
Option C: Bromination first, then nitration, acylation, nitration again, Fe/HCl, diazotization, reduction.
Option D: Acylation first, then bromination, nitration, Fe/HCl, nitration, diazotization, reduction.
Wait, let's think about the synthesis strategy. The target molecule has a nitro and bromine substituent on the ring, and an acetophenone group. The acetophenone is a friedel-crafts acylation, which requires an activated ring. Since nitro deactivates the ring, maybe the acylation is done before nitration? If we first activate the ring with, say, a bromine (activating, since it's an electron-donating group through induction?), then perform acylation, then nitrate? Wait, bromine is actually an activating group for electrophilic substitution because it donates electrons through sigma bonds. Wait, but wait: -Br is considered a weak activating group (since it's less activating than, say, -OH or -NH2), but more activating than -NO2. So if we brominate first, then the ring would be activated, making acylation feasible. Then after acylation, perhaps nitrate? But the nitro group would then direct the bromination in a certain way.
Alternatively, the standard approach to directing through substituents: when you have two substituents, the one with the stronger directing effect will dominate. For example, nitro is meta-directing, while Br is para/ortho. If both are present, which one wins?
Wait, the order of addition of substituents is key here. Let's say we start with benzene.
If we brominate first (option C starts with bromination), then the bromine is in a certain position. Let's say we add Br in the para position. Then, if we nitrate next, the nitro group would go meta to the bromine? Wait, but bromine is an activating group, so when we nitrate, the nitro would enter in the meta position relative to Br if Br is a director. Wait, but the directing for nitration is influenced by the substituent. Since Br is a meta director (if considering bromine as a deactivating director? Wait no, directing is based on the substituent's effect. Electron-withdrawing groups direct meta, electron-donating direct para/ortho. Wait, bromine is actually an electron-donor (since it's a sigma-donor), so would activate the ring. Therefore, Br is a para/ortho director. So when we nitrate a bromobenzene, the nitro group would enter in the para or ortho position. Wait, but if we first brominate, then the positions of the nitro would depend on where we add Br. But maybe the synthesis is designed such that after bromination and nitration, the positions are set for acylation.
Alternatively, maybe the acylation is done last. If the acetophenone group is added last, then the existing substituents (Br and NO2) would influence where the acetyl attaches. But Friedel-Crafts acylation is tricky on a ring with deactivating groups. However, if the ring has activating groups, it's more feasible. But in the target molecule, we have both Br (activating) and NO2 (deactivating). The overall effect would depend on which group has a stronger influence. Since NO2 is a stronger deactivator than Br is an activator, perhaps the ring would be deactivated. Therefore, acylation might need to be done before both nitration and bromination. Wait, but the acetophenone group is present in the target molecule. So regardless of substituents, at some point, we need to add the acetyl group. If the acetyl is added first, then subsequent nitration and bromination would occur in positions directed by the acetyl group. The acyl group (like acetophenone) is a meta director. So if we acylate first, the next substituent (say nitration) would occur at the meta position to the acetyl. Then bromination could be added in another position.
Let's see the options again.
Option D starts with acylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3), then bromination, nitration, and so on. If we do acylation first, then the ring has an acyl group. Then bromination would add Br to the para or ortho of the acyl group? Wait, but Br is directed by the acyl group, which is a meta-directing group. So bromine would go in the meta position? Or para? Wait, the acyl group (like a ketone) is a meta director, so when brominating, the Br would add in the meta position relative to the acyl. Then nitration next would add nitro in a position directed by both acyl and Br. Wait, but nitration is a meta director, so when nitrating a substituted benzene with an activating group (Br) and a deactivating group (acyl?), perhaps the direction is dominated by the strongest group. Hmm. This is getting confusing. Maybe I should look at the target structure again.
The target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the ethan-1-one (acetophenone) is attached at position 1. Then the bromine is at position 3, nitro at 5. Let's number the positions: 1 is the acetophenone. Then, going around the ring, positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So bromo is at 3, nitro at 5. So from the acetophenone group, bromine is two positions away (meta) and nitro is three positions away (para to the acetophenone?). Wait, no. If acetophenone is position 1, then positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So positions 1, 4 are para; 1,2 and 1,6 are meta. Wait, but in this case, bromine is at 3 (meta to 1) and nitro at 5 (meta to bromine?), but let's see. If acetophenone is at position 1, then position 3 is meta, and position 5 is the other meta (assuming the numbering is such that positions 1, 3, 5 are meta around the ring). Wait, maybe I'm misnumbering. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are adjacent. Wait, the nitro is at 5, which would be two positions from the bromine (positions 3 and 5 are two apart). Hmm. Let's draw a benzene ring with substituents. Let me try:
Acetophenone at position 1.
Then, at position 3 (two carbons away from position 1), we have Br.
At position 5 (two more carbons from Br), we have the nitro group.
So the substituents are at positions 1, 3, 5. So each is meta to each other. That is, the acetophenone is at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5. Then, from nitro at 5, meta positions would be 1 (already acetophenone) and 7, but since benzene only has 6 positions, 7 would be same as 1. So maybe that works. So to get such a substitution pattern, we need to add substituents in a certain order.
Let me think of the synthesis steps. Suppose we start with benzene.
First, we need to add one substituent, then direct the next, etc.
If we want the acetophenone group at position 1, then adding that first would allow the other substituents to be directed relative to it. However, as mentioned earlier, Friedel-Crafts acylation may not be feasible on a deactivated ring. So if the ring is deactivated by nitro groups, acylation would not occur. Therefore, perhaps the acylation should be done before nitration.
Alternatively, let's consider the following steps:
1. Acylate benzene to get acetophenone (this is an activating group, so future substitutions will be activated).
2. Nitrate the ring. The nitration will occur at the meta position relative to the acyl group.
3. Brominate the ring. The bromine will add at the para position relative to the acetyl group? Or depending on directing.
But wait, after acylation, the ring is activated. The acyl group is a deactivating, meta-directing group. Wait, acetyl is a deactivating group (due to resonance withdrawal of electrons), so it is meta-directing. Therefore, when you nitrate after acylation, the nitro group would go meta to the acyl. Then, when you brominate, the bromine would be directed by both the acyl and the nitro. Since nitro is a strong electron-withdrawing group (meta-directing), maybe the bromine would add meta to the nitro? Hmm.
Alternatively, let's consider the positions in the target molecule. Acetyl at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5. So each substitution is meta to the others. To achieve this, perhaps:
- First, acylate benzene to get acetophenone (position 1).
- Then nitrate, which would add nitro at position 5 (meta to acetyl).
- Then brominate at position 3 (meta to both acetyl and nitro)? Wait, but bromine is a different director. Wait, maybe that's not possible.
Wait, let's think again. If we have acetophenone (position 1), which is a meta-directing group. Then nitration would add nitro at position 3 or 5. Let's say it adds at position 5 (meta to acetyl). Then, the bromination would be directed by both the acetyl and the nitro. The acetyl is meta-directing (deactivating), and nitro is also meta-directing (deactivating). So when adding bromine, which is an electrophile, the directors would direct the bromine to positions meta to both. Wait, but that might not be possible. Alternatively, the strongest electron-withdrawing group (the nitro) may dominate the direction. So the bromine would add para or meta to the nitro group?
Alternatively, considering the existing substituents on the ring. Let's say we have acetyl at position 1 and nitro at position 5. Then, positions 3 and 4 would be adjacent to both. Wait, but in a benzene ring, each position is adjacent (ortho) and across (para) from others. Wait, maybe I need to use the correct numbering. Let me assign positions:
Benzene ring with substituents:
1: Acetyl (CH3CO-)
3: Br
5: NO2
But how to get substituents at positions 1, 3, 5? Let's number the benzene ring such that position 1 has the acetyl. Then, moving clockwise, positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. If position 3 has Br and position 5 has NO2, then they are each two positions away (meta) from each other and from the acetyl. So each is meta to the others.
To direct substituents into these positions, the existing substituents must direct the incoming groups. Let's think about the synthesis steps again.
Suppose we start with benzene.
Option 1:
a) Acylate (Friedel-Crafts) to get acetophenone. Now, the acetyl group is at position 1.
b) Nitrate the ring. The nitration will occur at the meta position relative to the acetyl, so position 5.
c) Brominate the ring. Now, the directors are the acetyl (meta-directing) and nitro (meta-directing). The bromine would add where? The positions available are 2, 3, 4, 6. But the strongest directing would be from the nitro group (since it's a stronger EWG). The nitro at position 5 would direct incoming substituents to position 3 (para) or positions 2 and 6 (ortho). But bromine is directed by the nitro group. However, the acetyl group is also present, which directs meta to itself (positions 3 and 5. But 5 is already occupied by nitro). Hmm.
Alternatively, perhaps after nitrating at position 5, the bromination would be directed to position 3, which is para to the acetyl group (but acetyl is meta-directing). Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I need to think about the actual mechanism.
Electrophilic substitution is directed by the substituents on the ring. Electron-withdrawing groups (EWG) deactivate the ring and direct incoming substituents to meta positions. Electron-donating groups (EDG) activate the ring and direct incoming substituents to ortho and para positions.
In our case, after acylation (EWG, meta-directing) and nitration (EWG, meta-directing), the next substitution (bromination) would be directed to the most deactivated position, which is meta to both existing substituents. But positions 3 and 4 are adjacent to 1 and 5. Wait, if substituents are at 1 and 5, then position 3 is two carbons away from acetyl and three carbons away from nitro. Alternatively, the available positions may be ortho and para to both substituents. But with two deactivating groups, the ring is deactivated except for the positions meta to both. But in that case, position 3 might be the only available spot. Wait, let's see. On a benzene ring, substituents at positions 1 and 5. Then positions 3 and 4 are adjacent. So bromination would add at position 3, which is meta to acetyl (position 1) and ortho/para to nitro (position 5). Hmm, but nitro is a strong meta-directing group. So if bromine is added next, would it add at position 3, which is para to the acetyl and ortho to the nitro? But the acetyl is meta-directing, so it would not direct anything para. Hmm.
Alternatively, the presence of two deactivating groups at positions 1 and 5 would mean that the most activated positions (where electrophilic substitution occurs) would be the positions meta to both, which in this case would be position 3 (and maybe position 7, which is equivalent to position 1). Wait, but there are only six positions. Let me think again: benzene with substituents at 1 and 5. Then, positions 3 and 4 are adjacent. The positions meta to both substituents might not exist. Alternatively, the ring would have two deactivating groups, making all positions except adjacent ones deactivated. Wait, this is getting complicated.
Maybe another approach: the target molecule has substituents at positions 1 (acetyl), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). So to get these substituents, we need to add them in a sequence where each subsequent substituent is added meta to the previous ones. How can we achieve that?
Suppose we start with benzene and first add the acetyl group at position 1. Then, add the nitro group at position 5 (meta to acetyl). Then, add the bromine at position 3 (meta to both acetyl and nitro). But how would that work? Because when adding bromine, the directors would need to point to position 3. Let's see:
After acetylation (position 1) and nitration (position 5), the bromine would be directed by both groups. Acetyl at 1 is meta-directing, so it would direct incoming groups to positions 3 and 5. But position 5 is already occupied by nitro. So bromine would go to position 3.
Similarly, nitro at 5 is meta-directing, so it would direct incoming groups to positions 3 and 7 (which is position 1). But positions 1 and 5 are occupied, so bromine would go to position 3, which is meta to nitro as well.
Therefore, position 3 is meta to both existing substituents, so that's where the bromine would add.
Therefore, the sequence would be:
1. Acetylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3)
2. Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4)
3. Bromination (Br2/FeBr3)
But then the problem is that after the first two steps, the ring might be too deactivated for bromination. Alternatively, perhaps the order is different. Let me look at the options given.
Option D: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2
Wait, this seems more complicated. Let me check the options.
Option A: steps are nitration, Fe/HCl (which is hydrogenation?), then acylation, bromination, nitration, then two more steps. Maybe.
Wait, but the target molecule has nitro and bromo substituents. So the synthesis would need to include nitration and bromination steps. Also, the acylation. Additionally, there are steps like Fe/HCl (hydrogenation), HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration), NaNO2/HCl (maybe some kind of diazotization?), and H3PO2 (which is a reducing agent).
Wait, H3PO2 is hypophosphorous acid, used as a selective reducing agent. For example, it can reduce nitrobenzene to aniline, but maybe under certain conditions it can reduce other groups as well.
Alternatively, the steps might involve directing the substituents properly through sequential nitration, bromination, acylation, etc., with some functional group interconversions.
This is getting tricky. Let's consider the positions of substitution. If the nitro group is at position 5 and bromo at 3, relative to the acetyl group at position 1. To get such a substitution pattern, perhaps the acetyl group needs to be added after some protection of the ring.
Wait, maybe an alternative pathway: let's say first nitration, then sulfonation to block a position, then bromination, then acylation, etc. But I don't see sulfonation in the steps here.
Wait, let's look at the answer options. All options start with different steps. Option A starts with nitration, then hydrogenation (Fe/HCl), then acylation, bromination, nitration again, etc. Option C starts with bromination, then two nitration steps, etc. Option D starts with acylation, bromination, nitration, etc.
Given that the target molecule has a nitro and a bromo substituent on the aromatic ring, and a ketone (acetyl group), all in meta positions relative to each other, the synthesis would need to carefully control the directing effects.
Suppose the correct sequence is:
1. Acylate benzene to get acetophenone. This activates the ring (but acetyl is actually a deactivating group, but maybe the first step can be done on benzene).
2. Nitrate the ring. The nitration would occur at the meta position relative to the acyl group (position 5 if acetyl is at 1).
3. Brominate the ring. The bromine would add at the position meta to both the acyl and nitro groups (position 3).
4. Then, perhaps some steps to introduce more substituents or protect groups, but in this case, the target molecule only has the three substituents. However, looking at the options, there are multiple steps after the initial substitutions, which may involve reduction or other functional group changes.
Wait, but the target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the acetyl group is attached at position 1, and the ring has nitro at 5 and bromo at 3. So after the three substitutions, no further functional group modifications are needed except maybe some reductions. Wait, but nitration is a nitro group, and bromination is bromo. The ketone is an acyl group. So perhaps the steps are acylation, nitration, bromination, followed by some other steps. But the answer options don't have that sequence exactly.
Looking at option D: Acylation, bromination, nitration, hydrogenation (Fe/HCl), nitration again, then diazotization and reduction. That seems complex. Let's parse option D's steps:
D) i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 ; ii) Br2/FeBr3 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iv) Fe/HCl ; v) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vi) NaNO2/HCl ; vii) H3PO2.
Step 1: Acylate benzene to acetophenone (position 1).
Step 2: Brominate. Since after acylation, the ring is activated, but the acyl group is meta-directing. So bromine would add at meta position to acetyl (position 3).
Step 3: Nitrate the ring. Now, with acetyl at 1 and bromo at 3, the nitration would be directed by both groups. The acetyl is meta-directing, directing to positions 3 and 5. The bromo is an EDG (since -Br is o,p-directing in activating), but wait, wait. Wait, when a substituent is ortho/para-directing, it's activating. But bromine is a halogen, which is typically deactivating but ortho/para-directing due to temporary +M effect (donating through sigma bonds while the ring is deprotonated). Wait, but wait: in reality, the directing effect depends on the substituent's groups. For example, alkyl groups are activating and ortho/para-directing. Halogens are weakly deactivating (meta-directing?) No, actually, halogens are ortho/para-directing but deactivating due to resonance withdrawal. Wait, no. Let me recall: substituents can be classified based on their electronic effects. For example:
- Activating groups: donate electrons through sigma bonds (EDG), ortho/para-directing (e.g., -OH, -O-, alkyl groups).
- Deactivating groups: withdraw electrons (EWG), meta-directing (e.g., nitro, carbonyl, sulfonic acid).
But wait, halogens are EWG (electron-withdrawing by induction) but are ortho/para-directing because they are poor electron donors but can destabilize the carbocation through resonance if in meta position.
Wait, no. Wait, the directing effect is determined by the stability of the carbocation intermediate in electrophilic substitution. If a substituent can stabilize the carbocation through resonance, it will direct the incoming electrophile to a position that allows such stabilization. For example, a substituent that can form a resonance structure with the adjacent carbocation will direct the attack to ortho or para positions.
Halogens (like Br) are ortho/para-directing because when the electrophile attacks at ortho or para positions relative to the halogen, the resulting carbocation can be stabilized by resonance with the halogen atom. The halogen can donate electrons through its sigma bonds (not resonance), hence ortho/para-directing. But since halogens are electronegative, they also withdraw electrons through induction, making the ring less reactive overall. However, their directing effect is based on resonance stabilization of the carbocation.
Wait, I might have to correct myself. Let me think again. For example, if the substituent is in the para position relative to the incoming electrophile, the carbocation would be at ortho positions. Let me draw this.
Suppose we have Br at position 3. If we attack at position 5 (meta to Br), the carbocation would be at 5. Can Br stabilize that through resonance? Probably not. If we attack at position 1 (ortho to Br), the carbocation would be at 1. Can Br stabilize that? If Br is at 3, then attacking at 1 would form a carbocation at 1. The Br at 3 can donate electrons through sigma bonds to the adjacent carbons, but resonance stabilization would not occur. Wait, halogens actually can stabilize the carbocation through resonance if the incoming electrophile attacks at a position that allows the halogen's lone pairs to enter the empty p-orbital of the carbocation. For example, if the electrophile attacks at the para position, the carbocation would be at the ortho positions relative to the halogen. The halogen can donate electrons through resonance to the ortho carbocation. Wait, perhaps this is more complicated.
Alternatively, the key point is that halogens are ortho/para-directing because when an electrophile attacks at ortho or para positions, the resulting carbocation can be conjugatively stabilized by the halogen's lone pairs. For example, if the halogen is at position 3 and the electrophile attacks at position 1 (ortho), the carbocation at 1 can be stabilized by the lone pairs of the Br atom through resonance. Similarly, if the electrophile attacks at position 5 (meta), the carbocation at 5 would not be adjacent to the Br, so no resonance stabilization. Therefore, the halogen directs electrophilic substitution to ortho and para positions.
But in our case, after acylation (position 1, deactivating, meta-directing) and bromination (position 3, activating, ortho/para-directing), the next nitration step (step 3 in option D) would be directed by both substituents.
The acetyl group at 1 is deactivating and meta-directing. The bromo group at 3 is activating and ortho/para-directing.
The nitration is a deactivating, meta-directing group. The question is, which substituent (acetyl or bromo) will have the dominant influence on the direction of nitration.
Since nitration is a meta director, the existing substituents will influence where the nitro group is placed. The acetyl group is deactivating and meta-directing. The bromo group is activating and ortho/para-directing.
The overall effect would depend on which substituent has a stronger influence. The bromo group is activating, which would tend to activate the ring and direct ortho/para. However, nitration is a meta reaction, so the existing substituents will direct the nitro group to meta positions relative to themselves if they are meta directors, but if the substituent is ortho/para-directing (like bromo), then the nitration would try to go meta to that.
Wait, this is getting too tangled. Let's consider the actual positions.
After steps 1 and 2 in option D, we have substituents at positions 1 (acetyl) and 3 (bromo). Now, we need to determine where the nitro group will be added in step 3.
The acetyl group is deactivating and meta-directing. So it would direct the nitro group to positions 5 (meta to acetyl) and 2 or 6 (meta to acetyl, but those are adjacent to bromo). However, the bromo group is activating and ortho/para-directing. So it would direct the nitro group to positions 2, 4 (ortho), and 1, 5 (para). But positions 1 is already acetylated, and position 5 is meta to acetyl. However, the bromo group is at position 3. Its ortho positions are 2 and 4; para would be 6 and 8 (?) Wait, on benzene, positions relative to substituent at 3:
- Ortho: 2 and 4
- Meta: 1 and 5
- Para: 6
But depending on numbering, perhaps. So, the bromo at 3 would direct nitration to positions 2, 4 (ortho) or 6 (para). However, the acetyl at 1 would direct nitration to position 5 (meta). Which direction dominates?
Since nitration is a meta director, the existing groups have to be considered. The acetyl is a meta director (deactivating), so it would direct the nitro to meta to itself (position 5). The bromo is an ortho/para director (activating), so it wants the nitro at positions 2,4,6.
However, the nitro group is deactivating and meta-directing, so it can't go para or ortho to bromo. Wait, no. The problem is that nitro groups are directed by the existing substituents. If the bromo is ortho/para-directing, then the nitro would go to positions ortho/para to bromo, but since nitro is deactivating, the ring would need activation. However, the acetyl is deactivating, making the ring less reactive except at meta positions. But this is getting too complicated.
Alternatively, perhaps after steps 1 (acetyl at 1) and 2 (bromo at 3), the ring has substituents at 1 and 3. Then nitration step 3 would add nitro at position 5 (meta to acetyl), assuming the acetyl's direction is followed. But the bromo at 3 is activating, so maybe it directs something else.
Alternatively, the bromo at 3 (activating) may make positions 2,4,6 more reactive. However, the acetyl at 1 (deactivating) makes positions 1, 2, and 3 less reactive except for meta. But with substituents at 1 and 3, positions 5 and 6 would be meta to acetyl. Hmm.
This is getting too confusing. Let's look at the answer options again.
Option D's steps are: acylation, bromination, nitration, Fe/HCl (hydrogenation?), then nitration again, then two more steps. The problem is that the target molecule has three substituents: acetyl, nitro, and bromo. So maybe the synthesis doesn't require multiple rounds of nitration and other steps. Perhaps steps 4 to 7 in option D are for other parts of the molecule, but the target molecule doesn't have any other functional groups. Wait, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the substituents are 3-bromo-5-nitro on the benzene ring, attached to the ketone at position 1. So only three substituents: acetyl (as the ketone), bromo, and nitro. Therefore, steps after bromination and nitration may be for what?
Wait, in option D:
Steps:
i) CH3COCl/AlCl3: Acylation (introduces acetyl group)
ii) Br2/FeBr3: Bromination (introduces bromo group)
iii) HNO3/H2SO4: Nitration (introduces nitro group)
Then step iv) Fe/HCl: which is hydrogenation, perhaps to reduce some double bonds, but the target molecule doesn't have any other rings or double bonds. Wait, the starting material is benzene. After acetylation, bromination, and nitration, all substituents are on the aromatic ring. So hydrogenation would not affect the aromatic ring. Maybe it's to hydrogenate some functional group introduced earlier. But in the target molecule, there's no reduced group. The functional groups are ketone, nitro, and bromide. Wait, nitro would not be reduced by Fe/HCl, which is mild hydrogenation. Nitro groups are typically reduced under more forcing conditions. Hypophosphorous acid (H3PO2) is used

alright, let's tackle this organic chemistry problem. the question is about the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. the answer is one of the four reaction sequences provided. hmm, okay. let me break down the target molecule first to understand what functional groups and substitutions are needed.
the target compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. so, the structure is a ketone (ethan-1-one is acetophenone, right?) attached to a substituted phenyl group. the substituents on the phenyl ring are bromine at the 3-position and nitro at the 5-position relative to the ketone. let me visualize the benzene ring: the ketone is at position 1, then the bromine is at 3 and nitro at 5. wait, in substituting positions, when you have a ketone (or acyl group) on the benzene ring, that's a meta-directing group. but once substituted, the directing effects might change. but maybe the synthesis doesn't rely entirely on directing effects but uses nitration and bromination steps at specific positions. let me think step by step.
starting with benzene, the first goal is to introduce the necessary substituents. the target molecule has a nitro group and a bromine atom on the ring, plus an acetophenone group. let's recall the common reactions:
- nitration of benzene with hno3/h2so4 (option a's first step is nitration, as is option c and d's steps later). the position of nitration depends on existing substituents.
- acylation with acetyl chloride (ch3cocl) under alcl3 catalysis would form acetophenone. alternatively, friedel-crafts acylation.
- bromination with br2/febr3 is a typical electrophilic substitution.
- the steps involving fe/hcl might be for hydrogenation or maybe dehalogenation? wait, fe/hcl is a catalyst for dehydrohalogenation or maybe it's for substituting a nitro group? wait, wait. wait, fe/hcl could be for the reduction of nitro groups to amino groups? wait, to convert nitrobenzene to aniline, you use h2/pd or sometimes fe + hcl. wait, the reaction of nitro compounds with fe/hcl might be a reduction. but fe/hcl is a catalyst for hydrogenation? wait, in nitration, sometimes after nitration, to remove a nitro group, you might use reduction, but here the target has a nitro group, so maybe they are nitrating first, then doing other steps. wait, let's look at the sequences.
the target molecule has both bromo and nitro groups. nitration is usually done with hno3, often with h2so4 as a catalyst. bromination with br2/febr3. the sequence of these additions is important because each substitution directs the next. let's think about the directing effects: nitro groups are meta directors, while bromine (as an electrophilic substituent) is para/ortho director. wait, but when there are two substituents, the direction of the next substituent depends on both. but maybe the synthesis uses a stepwise approach with nitration and bromination at specific positions.
moreover, the acetophenone group (the ketone) is also a substituent. friedel-crafts acylation would introduce an acyl group (in this case, acetyl) to the benzene ring. however, friedel-crafts is susceptible to side reactions if there are electron-withdrawing groups like nitro. the nitro group deactivates the ring and makes friedel-crafts acylation unfavorable. so perhaps the acylation step needs to happen before nitration? because once the nitro group is added, the ring becomes less reactive. alternatively, maybe the acylation is done after nitration but with some directing. hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. let's look at the options.
looking at the options:
option a: nitration (hno3/h2so4), then fe/hcl, then acylation, then bromination, then nitration again, then diazotization (nano2/hcl), and finally reduction with h3po2.
wait, diazotization is usually after converting to an amino group. so fe/hcl after nitration might be to reduce the nitro group to amino. then diazotization would require conversion to nitroso, but h3po2 is a reducing agent. wait, h3po2 is used in the reduction of diazonium salts, perhaps for replacement with hydrogen or other groups. maybe the sequence is nitrating first, then reducing the nitro to amino, then acylating, then brominating, then nitration again? that seems complicated.
option b: nitration, then fe/hcl, diazotization, reduction with h3po2, bromination, acylation, nitration again. hmm, also complex.
option c: bromination first, then nitration, acylation, nitration again, fe/hcl, diazotization, reduction.
option d: acylation first, then bromination, nitration, fe/hcl, nitration, diazotization, reduction.
wait, let's think about the synthesis strategy. the target molecule has a nitro and bromine substituent on the ring, and an acetophenone group. the acetophenone is a friedel-crafts acylation, which requires an activated ring. since nitro deactivates the ring, maybe the acylation is done before nitration? if we first activate the ring with, say, a bromine (activating, since it's an electron-donating group through induction?), then perform acylation, then nitrate? wait, bromine is actually an activating group for electrophilic substitution because it donates electrons through sigma bonds. wait, but wait: -br is considered a weak activating group (since it's less activating than, say, -oh or -nh2), but more activating than -no2. so if we brominate first, then the ring would be activated, making acylation feasible. then after acylation, perhaps nitrate? but the nitro group would then direct the bromination in a certain way.
alternatively, the standard approach to directing through substituents: when you have two substituents, the one with the stronger directing effect will dominate. for example, nitro is meta-directing, while br is para/ortho. if both are present, which one wins?
wait, the order of addition of substituents is key here. let's say we start with benzene.
if we brominate first (option c starts with bromination), then the bromine is in a certain position. let's say we add br in the para position. then, if we nitrate next, the nitro group would go meta to the bromine? wait, but bromine is an activating group, so when we nitrate, the nitro would enter in the meta position relative to br if br is a director. wait, but the directing for nitration is influenced by the substituent. since br is a meta director (if considering bromine as a deactivating director? wait no, directing is based on the substituent's effect. electron-withdrawing groups direct meta, electron-donating direct para/ortho. wait, bromine is actually an electron-donor (since it's a sigma-donor), so would activate the ring. therefore, br is a para/ortho director. so when we nitrate a bromobenzene, the nitro group would enter in the para or ortho position. wait, but if we first brominate, then the positions of the nitro would depend on where we add br. but maybe the synthesis is designed such that after bromination and nitration, the positions are set for acylation.
alternatively, maybe the acylation is done last. if the acetophenone group is added last, then the existing substituents (br and no2) would influence where the acetyl attaches. but friedel-crafts acylation is tricky on a ring with deactivating groups. however, if the ring has activating groups, it's more feasible. but in the target molecule, we have both br (activating) and no2 (deactivating). the overall effect would depend on which group has a stronger influence. since no2 is a stronger deactivator than br is an activator, perhaps the ring would be deactivated. therefore, acylation might need to be done before both nitration and bromination. wait, but the acetophenone group is present in the target molecule. so regardless of substituents, at some point, we need to add the acetyl group. if the acetyl is added first, then subsequent nitration and bromination would occur in positions directed by the acetyl group. the acyl group (like acetophenone) is a meta director. so if we acylate first, the next substituent (say nitration) would occur at the meta position to the acetyl. then bromination could be added in another position.
let's see the options again.
option d starts with acylation (ch3cocl/alcl3), then bromination, nitration, and so on. if we do acylation first, then the ring has an acyl group. then bromination would add br to the para or ortho of the acyl group? wait, but br is directed by the acyl group, which is a meta-directing group. so bromine would go in the meta position? or para? wait, the acyl group (like a ketone) is a meta director, so when brominating, the br would add in the meta position relative to the acyl. then nitration next would add nitro in a position directed by both acyl and br. wait, but nitration is a meta director, so when nitrating a substituted benzene with an activating group (br) and a deactivating group (acyl?), perhaps the direction is dominated by the strongest group. hmm. this is getting confusing. maybe i should look at the target structure again.
the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. so the ethan-1-one (acetophenone) is attached at position 1. then the bromine is at position 3, nitro at 5. let's number the positions: 1 is the acetophenone. then, going around the ring, positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. so bromo is at 3, nitro at 5. so from the acetophenone group, bromine is two positions away (meta) and nitro is three positions away (para to the acetophenone?). wait, no. if acetophenone is position 1, then positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. so positions 1, 4 are para; 1,2 and 1,6 are meta. wait, but in this case, bromine is at 3 (meta to 1) and nitro at 5 (meta to bromine?), but let's see. if acetophenone is at position 1, then position 3 is meta, and position 5 is the other meta (assuming the numbering is such that positions 1, 3, 5 are meta around the ring). wait, maybe i'm misnumbering. alternatively, maybe the substituents are adjacent. wait, the nitro is at 5, which would be two positions from the bromine (positions 3 and 5 are two apart). hmm. let's draw a benzene ring with substituents. let me try:
acetophenone at position 1.
then, at position 3 (two carbons away from position 1), we have br.
at position 5 (two more carbons from br), we have the nitro group.
so the substituents are at positions 1, 3, 5. so each is meta to each other. that is, the acetophenone is at 1, br at 3, nitro at 5. then, from nitro at 5, meta positions would be 1 (already acetophenone) and 7, but since benzene only has 6 positions, 7 would be same as 1. so maybe that works. so to get such a substitution pattern, we need to add substituents in a certain order.
let me think of the synthesis steps. suppose we start with benzene.
first, we need to add one substituent, then direct the next, etc.
if we want the acetophenone group at position 1, then adding that first would allow the other substituents to be directed relative to it. however, as mentioned earlier, friedel-crafts acylation may not be feasible on a deactivated ring. so if the ring is deactivated by nitro groups, acylation would not occur. therefore, perhaps the acylation should be done before nitration.
alternatively, let's consider the following steps:
1. acylate benzene to get acetophenone (this is an activating group, so future substitutions will be activated).
2. nitrate the ring. the nitration will occur at the meta position relative to the acyl group.
3. brominate the ring. the bromine will add at the para position relative to the acetyl group? or depending on directing.
but wait, after acylation, the ring is activated. the acyl group is a deactivating, meta-directing group. wait, acetyl is a deactivating group (due to resonance withdrawal of electrons), so it is meta-directing. therefore, when you nitrate after acylation, the nitro group would go meta to the acyl. then, when you brominate, the bromine would be directed by both the acyl and the nitro. since nitro is a strong electron-withdrawing group (meta-directing), maybe the bromine would add meta to the nitro? hmm.
alternatively, let's consider the positions in the target molecule. acetyl at 1, br at 3, nitro at 5. so each substitution is meta to the others. to achieve this, perhaps:
- first, acylate benzene to get acetophenone (position 1).
- then nitrate, which would add nitro at position 5 (meta to acetyl).
- then brominate at position 3 (meta to both acetyl and nitro)? wait, but bromine is a different director. wait, maybe that's not possible.
wait, let's think again. if we have acetophenone (position 1), which is a meta-directing group. then nitration would add nitro at position 3 or 5. let's say it adds at position 5 (meta to acetyl). then, the bromination would be directed by both the acetyl and the nitro. the acetyl is meta-directing (deactivating), and nitro is also meta-directing (deactivating). so when adding bromine, which is an electrophile, the directors would direct the bromine to positions meta to both. wait, but that might not be possible. alternatively, the strongest electron-withdrawing group (the nitro) may dominate the direction. so the bromine would add para or meta to the nitro group?
alternatively, considering the existing substituents on the ring. let's say we have acetyl at position 1 and nitro at position 5. then, positions 3 and 4 would be adjacent to both. wait, but in a benzene ring, each position is adjacent (ortho) and across (para) from others. wait, maybe i need to use the correct numbering. let me assign positions:
benzene ring with substituents:
1: acetyl (ch3co-)
3: br
5: no2
but how to get substituents at positions 1, 3, 5? let's number the benzene ring such that position 1 has the acetyl. then, moving clockwise, positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. if position 3 has br and position 5 has no2, then they are each two positions away (meta) from each other and from the acetyl. so each is meta to the others.
to direct substituents into these positions, the existing substituents must direct the incoming groups. let's think about the synthesis steps again.
suppose we start with benzene.
option 1:
a) acylate (friedel-crafts) to get acetophenone. now, the acetyl group is at position 1.
b) nitrate the ring. the nitration will occur at the meta position relative to the acetyl, so position 5.
c) brominate the ring. now, the directors are the acetyl (meta-directing) and nitro (meta-directing). the bromine would add where? the positions available are 2, 3, 4, 6. but the strongest directing would be from the nitro group (since it's a stronger ewg). the nitro at position 5 would direct incoming substituents to position 3 (para) or positions 2 and 6 (ortho). but bromine is directed by the nitro group. however, the acetyl group is also present, which directs meta to itself (positions 3 and 5. but 5 is already occupied by nitro). hmm.
alternatively, perhaps after nitrating at position 5, the bromination would be directed to position 3, which is para to the acetyl group (but acetyl is meta-directing). hmm, this is confusing. maybe i need to think about the actual mechanism.
electrophilic substitution is directed by the substituents on the ring. electron-withdrawing groups (ewg) deactivate the ring and direct incoming substituents to meta positions. electron-donating groups (edg) activate the ring and direct incoming substituents to ortho and para positions.
in our case, after acylation (ewg, meta-directing) and nitration (ewg, meta-directing), the next substitution (bromination) would be directed to the most deactivated position, which is meta to both existing substituents. but positions 3 and 4 are adjacent to 1 and 5. wait, if substituents are at 1 and 5, then position 3 is two carbons away from acetyl and three carbons away from nitro. alternatively, the available positions may be ortho and para to both substituents. but with two deactivating groups, the ring is deactivated except for the positions meta to both. but in that case, position 3 might be the only available spot. wait, let's see. on a benzene ring, substituents at positions 1 and 5. then positions 3 and 4 are adjacent. so bromination would add at position 3, which is meta to acetyl (position 1) and ortho/para to nitro (position 5). hmm, but nitro is a strong meta-directing group. so if bromine is added next, would it add at position 3, which is para to the acetyl and ortho to the nitro? but the acetyl is meta-directing, so it would not direct anything para. hmm.
alternatively, the presence of two deactivating groups at positions 1 and 5 would mean that the most activated positions (where electrophilic substitution occurs) would be the positions meta to both, which in this case would be position 3 (and maybe position 7, which is equivalent to position 1). wait, but there are only six positions. let me think again: benzene with substituents at 1 and 5. then, positions 3 and 4 are adjacent. the positions meta to both substituents might not exist. alternatively, the ring would have two deactivating groups, making all positions except adjacent ones deactivated. wait, this is getting complicated.
maybe another approach: the target molecule has substituents at positions 1 (acetyl), 3 (br), and 5 (no2). so to get these substituents, we need to add them in a sequence where each subsequent substituent is added meta to the previous ones. how can we achieve that?
suppose we start with benzene and first add the acetyl group at position 1. then, add the nitro group at position 5 (meta to acetyl). then, add the bromine at position 3 (meta to both acetyl and nitro). but how would that work? because when adding bromine, the directors would need to point to position 3. let's see:
after acetylation (position 1) and nitration (position 5), the bromine would be directed by both groups. acetyl at 1 is meta-directing, so it would direct incoming groups to positions 3 and 5. but position 5 is already occupied by nitro. so bromine would go to position 3.
similarly, nitro at 5 is meta-directing, so it would direct incoming groups to positions 3 and 7 (which is position 1). but positions 1 and 5 are occupied, so bromine would go to position 3, which is meta to nitro as well.
therefore, position 3 is meta to both existing substituents, so that's where the bromine would add.
therefore, the sequence would be:
1. acetylation (ch3cocl/alcl3)
2. nitration (hno3/h2so4)
3. bromination (br2/febr3)
but then the problem is that after the first two steps, the ring might be too deactivated for bromination. alternatively, perhaps the order is different. let me look at the options given.
option d: i) ch3cocl/alcl3 ; ii) br2/febr3 ; iii) hno3/h2so4 ; iv) fe/hcl ; v) hno3/h2so4 ; vi) nano2/hcl ; vii) h3po2
wait, this seems more complicated. let me check the options.
option a: steps are nitration, fe/hcl (which is hydrogenation?), then acylation, bromination, nitration, then two more steps. maybe.
wait, but the target molecule has nitro and bromo substituents. so the synthesis would need to include nitration and bromination steps. also, the acylation. additionally, there are steps like fe/hcl (hydrogenation), hno3/h2so4 (nitration), nano2/hcl (maybe some kind of diazotization?), and h3po2 (which is a reducing agent).
wait, h3po2 is hypophosphorous acid, used as a selective reducing agent. for example, it can reduce nitrobenzene to aniline, but maybe under certain conditions it can reduce other groups as well.
alternatively, the steps might involve directing the substituents properly through sequential nitration, bromination, acylation, etc., with some functional group interconversions.
this is getting tricky. let's consider the positions of substitution. if the nitro group is at position 5 and bromo at 3, relative to the acetyl group at position 1. to get such a substitution pattern, perhaps the acetyl group needs to be added after some protection of the ring.
wait, maybe an alternative pathway: let's say first nitration, then sulfonation to block a position, then bromination, then acylation, etc. but i don't see sulfonation in the steps here.
wait, let's look at the answer options. all options start with different steps. option a starts with nitration, then hydrogenation (fe/hcl), then acylation, bromination, nitration again, etc. option c starts with bromination, then two nitration steps, etc. option d starts with acylation, bromination, nitration, etc.
given that the target molecule has a nitro and a bromo substituent on the aromatic ring, and a ketone (acetyl group), all in meta positions relative to each other, the synthesis would need to carefully control the directing effects.
suppose the correct sequence is:
1. acylate benzene to get acetophenone. this activates the ring (but acetyl is actually a deactivating group, but maybe the first step can be done on benzene).
2. nitrate the ring. the nitration would occur at the meta position relative to the acyl group (position 5 if acetyl is at 1).
3. brominate the ring. the bromine would add at the position meta to both the acyl and nitro groups (position 3).
4. then, perhaps some steps to introduce more substituents or protect groups, but in this case, the target molecule only has the three substituents. however, looking at the options, there are multiple steps after the initial substitutions, which may involve reduction or other functional group changes.
wait, but the target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. so the acetyl group is attached at position 1, and the ring has nitro at 5 and bromo at 3. so after the three substitutions, no further functional group modifications are needed except maybe some reductions. wait, but nitration is a nitro group, and bromination is bromo. the ketone is an acyl group. so perhaps the steps are acylation, nitration, bromination, followed by some other steps. but the answer options don't have that sequence exactly.
looking at option d: acylation, bromination, nitration, hydrogenation (fe/hcl), nitration again, then diazotization and reduction. that seems complex. let's parse option d's steps:
d) i) ch3cocl/alcl3 ; ii) br2/febr3 ; iii) hno3/h2so4 ; iv) fe/hcl ; v) hno3/h2so4 ; vi) nano2/hcl ; vii) h3po2.
step 1: acylate benzene to acetophenone (position 1).
step 2: brominate. since after acylation, the ring is activated, but the acyl group is meta-directing. so bromine would add at meta position to acetyl (position 3).
step 3: nitrate the ring. now, with acetyl at 1 and bromo at 3, the nitration would be directed by both groups. the acetyl is meta-directing, directing to positions 3 and 5. the bromo is an edg (since -br is o,p-directing in activating), but wait, wait. wait, when a substituent is ortho/para-directing, it's activating. but bromine is a halogen, which is typically deactivating but ortho/para-directing due to temporary +m effect (donating through sigma bonds while the ring is deprotonated). wait, but wait: in reality, the directing effect depends on the substituent's groups. for example, alkyl groups are activating and ortho/para-directing. halogens are weakly deactivating (meta-directing?) no, actually, halogens are ortho/para-directing but deactivating due to resonance withdrawal. wait, no. let me recall: substituents can be classified based on their electronic effects. for example:
- activating groups: donate electrons through sigma bonds (edg), ortho/para-directing (e.g., -oh, -o-, alkyl groups).
- deactivating groups: withdraw electrons (ewg), meta-directing (e.g., nitro, carbonyl, sulfonic acid).
but wait, halogens are ewg (electron-withdrawing by induction) but are ortho/para-directing because they are poor electron donors but can destabilize the carbocation through resonance if in meta position.
wait, no. wait, the directing effect is determined by the stability of the carbocation intermediate in electrophilic substitution. if a substituent can stabilize the carbocation through resonance, it will direct the incoming electrophile to a position that allows such stabilization. for example, a substituent that can form a resonance structure with the adjacent carbocation will direct the attack to ortho or para positions.
halogens (like br) are ortho/para-directing because when the electrophile attacks at ortho or para positions relative to the halogen, the resulting carbocation can be stabilized by resonance with the halogen atom. the halogen can donate electrons through its sigma bonds (not resonance), hence ortho/para-directing. but since halogens are electronegative, they also withdraw electrons through induction, making the ring less reactive overall. however, their directing effect is based on resonance stabilization of the carbocation.
wait, i might have to correct myself. let me think again. for example, if the substituent is in the para position relative to the incoming electrophile, the carbocation would be at ortho positions. let me draw this.
suppose we have br at position 3. if we attack at position 5 (meta to br), the carbocation would be at 5. can br stabilize that through resonance? probably not. if we attack at position 1 (ortho to br), the carbocation would be at 1. can br stabilize that? if br is at 3, then attacking at 1 would form a carbocation at 1. the br at 3 can donate electrons through sigma bonds to the adjacent carbons, but resonance stabilization would not occur. wait, halogens actually can stabilize the carbocation through resonance if the incoming electrophile attacks at a position that allows the halogen's lone pairs to enter the empty p-orbital of the carbocation. for example, if the electrophile attacks at the para position, the carbocation would be at the ortho positions relative to the halogen. the halogen can donate electrons through resonance to the ortho carbocation. wait, perhaps this is more complicated.
alternatively, the key point is that halogens are ortho/para-directing because when an electrophile attacks at ortho or para positions, the resulting carbocation can be conjugatively stabilized by the halogen's lone pairs. for example, if the halogen is at position 3 and the electrophile attacks at position 1 (ortho), the carbocation at 1 can be stabilized by the lone pairs of the br atom through resonance. similarly, if the electrophile attacks at position 5 (meta), the carbocation at 5 would not be adjacent to the br, so no resonance stabilization. therefore, the halogen directs electrophilic substitution to ortho and para positions.
but in our case, after acylation (position 1, deactivating, meta-directing) and bromination (position 3, activating, ortho/para-directing), the next nitration step (step 3 in option d) would be directed by both substituents.
the acetyl group at 1 is deactivating and meta-directing. the bromo group at 3 is activating and ortho/para-directing.
the nitration is a deactivating, meta-directing group. the question is, which substituent (acetyl or bromo) will have the dominant influence on the direction of nitration.
since nitration is a meta director, the existing substituents will influence where the nitro group is placed. the acetyl group is deactivating and meta-directing. the bromo group is activating and ortho/para-directing.
the overall effect would depend on which substituent has a stronger influence. the bromo group is activating, which would tend to activate the ring and direct ortho/para. however, nitration is a meta reaction, so the existing substituents will direct the nitro group to meta positions relative to themselves if they are meta directors, but if the substituent is ortho/para-directing (like bromo), then the nitration would try to go meta to that.
wait, this is getting too tangled. let's consider the actual positions.
after steps 1 and 2 in option d, we have substituents at positions 1 (acetyl) and 3 (bromo). now, we need to determine where the nitro group will be added in step 3.
the acetyl group is deactivating and meta-directing. so it would direct the nitro group to positions 5 (meta to acetyl) and 2 or 6 (meta to acetyl, but those are adjacent to bromo). however, the bromo group is activating and ortho/para-directing. so it would direct the nitro group to positions 2, 4 (ortho), and 1, 5 (para). but positions 1 is already acetylated, and position 5 is meta to acetyl. however, the bromo group is at position 3. its ortho positions are 2 and 4; para would be 6 and 8 (?) wait, on benzene, positions relative to substituent at 3:
- ortho: 2 and 4
- meta: 1 and 5
- para: 6
but depending on numbering, perhaps. so, the bromo at 3 would direct nitration to positions 2, 4 (ortho) or 6 (para). however, the acetyl at 1 would direct nitration to position 5 (meta). which direction dominates?
since nitration is a meta director, the existing groups have to be considered. the acetyl is a meta director (deactivating), so it would direct the nitro to meta to itself (position 5). the bromo is an ortho/para director (activating), so it wants the nitro at positions 2,4,6.
however, the nitro group is deactivating and meta-directing, so it can't go para or ortho to bromo. wait, no. the problem is that nitro groups are directed by the existing substituents. if the bromo is ortho/para-directing, then the nitro would go to positions ortho/para to bromo, but since nitro is deactivating, the ring would need activation. however, the acetyl is deactivating, making the ring less reactive except at meta positions. but this is getting too complicated.
alternatively, perhaps after steps 1 (acetyl at 1) and 2 (bromo at 3), the ring has substituents at 1 and 3. then nitration step 3 would add nitro at position 5 (meta to acetyl), assuming the acetyl's direction is followed. but the bromo at 3 is activating, so maybe it directs something else.
alternatively, the bromo at 3 (activating) may make positions 2,4,6 more reactive. however, the acetyl at 1 (deactivating) makes positions 1, 2, and 3 less reactive except for meta. but with substituents at 1 and 3, positions 5 and 6 would be meta to acetyl. hmm.
this is getting too confusing. let's look at the answer options again.
option d's steps are: acylation, bromination, nitration, fe/hcl (hydrogenation?), then nitration again, then two more steps. the problem is that the target molecule has three substituents: acetyl, nitro, and bromo. so maybe the synthesis doesn't require multiple rounds of nitration and other steps. perhaps steps 4 to 7 in option d are for other parts of the molecule, but the target molecule doesn't have any other functional groups. wait, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. so the substituents are 3-bromo-5-nitro on the benzene ring, attached to the ketone at position 1. so only three substituents: acetyl (as the ketone), bromo, and nitro. therefore, steps after bromination and nitration may be for what?
wait, in option d:
steps:
i) ch3cocl/alcl3: acylation (introduces acetyl group)
ii) br2/febr3: bromination (introduces bromo group)
iii) hno3/h2so4: nitration (introduces nitro group)
then step iv) fe/hcl: which is hydrogenation, perhaps to reduce some double bonds, but the target molecule doesn't have any other rings or double bonds. wait, the starting material is benzene. after acetylation, bromination, and nitration, all substituents are on the aromatic ring. so hydrogenation would not affect the aromatic ring. maybe it's to hydrogenate some functional group introduced earlier. but in the target molecule, there's no reduced group. the functional groups are ketone, nitro, and bromide. wait, nitro would not be reduced by fe/hcl, which is mild hydrogenation. nitro groups are typically reduced under more forcing conditions. hypophosphorous acid (h3po2) is used
