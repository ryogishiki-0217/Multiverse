Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε * (σ . n), where ε is a constant with energy dimensions, n is an arbitrary unit vector, and σ represents the Pauli spin matrices. The question is asking for the eigenvalues of H. The options are A through D.

1: First, I remember that Pauli spin matrices, σ_x, σ_y, and σ_z, are 2x2 matrices. Each of them has eigenvalues +1 and -1. But here, the Hamiltonian is a scalar product of σ and n, multiplied by ε. So H = ε(σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z). I need to figure out the eigenvalues of this operator.

<Path>
2: The Pauli vector σ is defined as the vector composed of the three Pauli matrices: σ = (σ_x, σ_y, σ_z). Each Pauli matrix is a 2x2 Hermitian matrix, and since n is a unit vector, the dot product σ.n would be a linear combination of these matrices weighted by the components of n.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The Pauli spin matrices are 2x2 Hermitian matrices with eigenvalues ±1. The Pauli vector σ = (σ_x, σ_y, σ_z) is a vector of these matrices, and σ.n is a linear combination of them weighted by the components of the unit vector n.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
The key here is probably to recognize that σ.n is itself a combination of the Pauli matrices. But since n is a unit vector, does σ.n have the same eigenvalues as a single Pauli matrix? Wait, each individual Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1, but what about their combination?

1: The eigenvalues of the Pauli vector σ.n can be determined for a specific case where the unit vector n is chosen to be (1, 0, 0). In this case, the operator σ.n simplifies to σ_x, which has eigenvalues +1 and -1. Multiplying by the constant ε results in eigenvalues of ε and -ε, leading to the hypothesis that the answer is option A. This result is consistent with the eigenvalues of σ.n being ±1 for any unit vector n, as the eigenvalues of σ.n are equivalent to those of the individual Pauli matrices.

2: The eigenvalues of σ.n are determined by its properties as a linear combination of Pauli matrices. The operator σ.n can be considered a scaled version of a Pauli matrix when n is a unit vector. The matrix σ.n is a linear combination of σ_x, σ_y, and σ_z with coefficients from the unit vector n. The operator σ.n is a 2x2 Hermitian matrix, a characteristic shared by individual Pauli matrices. The eigenvalues of any such 2x2 Hermitian matrix are real numbers.

<Conclusion>
The eigenvalues of σ.n are ±1 for specific unit vectors n, and this result is consistent with the general property that σ.n is a 2x2 Hermitian matrix with real eigenvalues. The specific case for n=(1,0,0) yields eigenvalues +1 and -1 for σ.n, which are consistent with the individual Pauli matrices.

1: The operator σ.n is a 2x2 Hermitian matrix, a property it shares with individual Pauli matrices. The eigenvalues of any 2x2 Hermitian matrix are real numbers. The operator σ.n is related to the Pauli matrices by a unitary transformation when n is a different unit vector, implying its eigenvalues are the same as those of the original Pauli matrices. The eigenvalues of σ.n are therefore +1 and -1.

2: The operator σ.n is a linear combination of Pauli matrices with coefficients from a unit vector n, similar to the angular momentum operator S in a particular direction. The eigenvalues of the spin operator S·n for spin-1/2 particles are ±ħ/2. However, the Pauli matrices σ are related to the spin operator S by S = ħ/2 σ. The operator σ.n is equivalent to 2S·n/ħ. If S·n has eigenvalues ±ħ/2, then σ.n = 2S·n/ħ would have eigenvalues ±1. Consequently, the Hamiltonian H = εσ.n would have eigenvalues ±ε.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The eigenvalues of σ.n are ±1, as it is a 2x2 Hermitian matrix and its eigenvalues match those of the Pauli matrices. This result is also confirmed by considering the operator σ.n as 2S·n/ħ, where S·n has eigenvalues ±ħ/2 for spin-1/2 particles, leading to σ.n having eigenvalues ±1.

Therefore, the eigenvalues of H would be ε times those of σ.n, so +ε and -ε. Therefore, answer A. But wait, let me verify this step by step to be sure. First, the Pauli matrices σ_x, σ_y, σ_z each have eigenvalues +1 and -1. When you take a combination like σ.n, which is (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z), this is equivalent to a matrix. Since n is a unit vector, (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) = 1. Therefore, σ.n is a combination of the Pauli matrices with weights n_x, n_y, n_z. But regardless of the weights (as long as they form a unit vector), the eigenvalues of σ.n are ±1. Is this true? Let's recall that for any unit vector n, the matrix σ.n is a Pauli matrix in the direction of n. Since Pauli matrices are traceless, Hermitian, and their eigenvalues are always ±1, regardless of the direction. So even though the eigenvectors depend on the direction n, the eigenvalues remain ±1. Therefore, scaling this by ε would give eigenvalues of ε*1 and ε*(-1), so ε and -ε. Therefore, the answer should be option A. But looking at the options again: A) +ε, -ε B) +ħ/2, -ħ/2 C) +1, -1 D) +ε ħ/2, -ε ħ/2 Hmm. So if my reasoning is correct, then A is correct. The other options can be eliminated. Option B has ħ/2, which are typical for spin-1/2 systems, but here the Hamiltonian is ε times σ.n, so the energy scale is set by ε, so B is incorrect. Option C is the eigenvalues of the dimensionless σ.n, so that's correct for the combination, but since H is ε times that, the eigenvalues should be scaled by ε, making A correct. Option D is a combination, but again, scaling the ħ/2 by ε would be incorrect, as the Pauli matrices are dimensionless. Wait, actually, hold on. The Pauli matrices are dimensionless, so σ.n is dimensionless (since n is dimensionless), so the Hamiltonian H has the dimension of ε (since ε has the dimension of energy). Therefore, the eigenvalues must have the dimension of energy, which would match option A (±ε), but option D has ± ε ħ/2. However, since Pauli matrices are related to spin matrices which are ħ/2 times the Pauli matrices, but in the Hamiltonian given here, it's written as ε times σ.n. So if the problem had H = ε (S . n), where S is the spin operator, then the eigenvalues would involve ħ/2. But here, it's explicitly stated as Pauli spin matrices σ, which are 2x2 matrices with eigenvalues ±1. Therefore, H = ε σ.n will have eigenvalues ε*1 and ε*(-1), so ±ε. Thus, answer A. To confirm, let's diagonalize σ.n quickly. Since σ.n is a traceless, Hermitian matrix, its eigenvalues must satisfy trace(σ.n) = 0, and the sum of eigenvalues is zero, which is consistent with ±1. The determinant of σ.n would be |(n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z)|. Since this matrix is a linear combination of Pauli matrices, which are all traceless and have determinant 1 individually. Wait, but the determinant of a generic combination might be different. Let me actually compute it. The matrix σ.n can be written as: n_x [0 1; 1 0] + n_y [0 -i; i 0] + n_z [1 0; 0 -1] So combining these, σ.n = [n_z , n_x - i n_y; n_x + i n_y, -n_z] So the matrix is: [n_z , n_x - i n_y; n_x + i n_y, -n_z] Therefore, the determinant is (n_z)*(-n_z) - (n_x + i n_y)(n_x - i n_y) = -n_z2 - (n_x2 + n_y2) = -n_z2 - n_x2 - n_y2 = - (n_x2 + n_y2 + n_z2) = -1, since n is a unit vector. So the determinant is -1. The trace is 0, as we saw. For a 2x2 matrix, if the trace is 0 and determinant is -1, the eigenvalues are ±sqrt(1), i.e., ±1. Yes, exactly. So regardless of the components of n, the eigenvalues of σ.n are always +1 and -1. Therefore, multiplying by ε, the Hamiltonian H will have eigenvalues ε and -ε. So the answer is A.
**Final Answer** 
\boxed{A}

Answer: The problem asks for the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector, \(\varepsilon\) is a constant with energy dimensions, and \(\vec{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli spin matrices.

1. **Understanding the Pauli Matrices**: Each Pauli matrix (\(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), \(\sigma_z\)) is a 2x2 Hermitian matrix with eigenvalues \(+1\) and \(-1\). The operator \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) is a linear combination of these matrices weighted by the components of the unit vector \(\vec{n}\).

2. **Properties of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\)**:
   - The matrix \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) is traceless and Hermitian.
   - For any unit vector \(\vec{n}\), the eigenvalues of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) are \(+1\) and \(-1\). This is confirmed by diagonalizing the matrix, which shows the determinant is \(-1\) and the trace is \(0\), leading to eigenvalues \( \pm 1 \).

3. **Eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian**:
   - The Hamiltonian \(H\) is given by \( \varepsilon \) times \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\). Since \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) has eigenvalues \(+1\) and \(-1\), scaling by \(\varepsilon\) results in eigenvalues \( \varepsilon \) and \( -\varepsilon \).

Thus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator are \( +\varepsilon \) and \( -\varepsilon \).

therefore, the eigenvalues of h would be ε times those of σ.n, so +ε and -ε. therefore, answer a. but wait, let me verify this step by step to be sure. first, the pauli matrices σ_x, σ_y, σ_z each have eigenvalues +1 and -1. when you take a combination like σ.n, which is (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z), this is equivalent to a matrix. since n is a unit vector, (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) = 1. therefore, σ.n is a combination of the pauli matrices with weights n_x, n_y, n_z. but regardless of the weights (as long as they form a unit vector), the eigenvalues of σ.n are ±1. is this true? let's recall that for any unit vector n, the matrix σ.n is a pauli matrix in the direction of n. since pauli matrices are traceless, hermitian, and their eigenvalues are always ±1, regardless of the direction. so even though the eigenvectors depend on the direction n, the eigenvalues remain ±1. therefore, scaling this by ε would give eigenvalues of ε*1 and ε*(-1), so ε and -ε. therefore, the answer should be option a. but looking at the options again: a) +ε, -ε b) +ħ/2, -ħ/2 c) +1, -1 d) +ε ħ/2, -ε ħ/2 hmm. so if my reasoning is correct, then a is correct. the other options can be eliminated. option b has ħ/2, which are typical for spin-1/2 systems, but here the hamiltonian is ε times σ.n, so the energy scale is set by ε, so b is incorrect. option c is the eigenvalues of the dimensionless σ.n, so that's correct for the combination, but since h is ε times that, the eigenvalues should be scaled by ε, making a correct. option d is a combination, but again, scaling the ħ/2 by ε would be incorrect, as the pauli matrices are dimensionless. wait, actually, hold on. the pauli matrices are dimensionless, so σ.n is dimensionless (since n is dimensionless), so the hamiltonian h has the dimension of ε (since ε has the dimension of energy). therefore, the eigenvalues must have the dimension of energy, which would match option a (±ε), but option d has ± ε ħ/2. however, since pauli matrices are related to spin matrices which are ħ/2 times the pauli matrices, but in the hamiltonian given here, it's written as ε times σ.n. so if the problem had h = ε (s . n), where s is the spin operator, then the eigenvalues would involve ħ/2. but here, it's explicitly stated as pauli spin matrices σ, which are 2x2 matrices with eigenvalues ±1. therefore, h = ε σ.n will have eigenvalues ε*1 and ε*(-1), so ±ε. thus, answer a. to confirm, let's diagonalize σ.n quickly. since σ.n is a traceless, hermitian matrix, its eigenvalues must satisfy trace(σ.n) = 0, and the sum of eigenvalues is zero, which is consistent with ±1. the determinant of σ.n would be |(n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z)|. since this matrix is a linear combination of pauli matrices, which are all traceless and have determinant 1 individually. wait, but the determinant of a generic combination might be different. let me actually compute it. the matrix σ.n can be written as: n_x [0 1; 1 0] + n_y [0 -i; i 0] + n_z [1 0; 0 -1] so combining these, σ.n = [n_z , n_x - i n_y; n_x + i n_y, -n_z] so the matrix is: [n_z , n_x - i n_y; n_x + i n_y, -n_z] therefore, the determinant is (n_z)*(-n_z) - (n_x + i n_y)(n_x - i n_y) = -n_z2 - (n_x2 + n_y2) = -n_z2 - n_x2 - n_y2 = - (n_x2 + n_y2 + n_z2) = -1, since n is a unit vector. so the determinant is -1. the trace is 0, as we saw. for a 2x2 matrix, if the trace is 0 and determinant is -1, the eigenvalues are ±sqrt(1), i.e., ±1. yes, exactly. so regardless of the components of n, the eigenvalues of σ.n are always +1 and -1. therefore, multiplying by ε, the hamiltonian h will have eigenvalues ε and -ε. so the answer is a.
**final answer** 
\boxed{a}

answer: the problem asks for the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian operator \( h = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector, \(\varepsilon\) is a constant with energy dimensions, and \(\vec{\sigma}\) represents the pauli spin matrices.

1. **understanding the pauli matrices**: each pauli matrix (\(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), \(\sigma_z\)) is a 2x2 hermitian matrix with eigenvalues \(+1\) and \(-1\). the operator \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) is a linear combination of these matrices weighted by the components of the unit vector \(\vec{n}\).

2. **properties of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\)**:
   - the matrix \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) is traceless and hermitian.
   - for any unit vector \(\vec{n}\), the eigenvalues of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) are \(+1\) and \(-1\). this is confirmed by diagonalizing the matrix, which shows the determinant is \(-1\) and the trace is \(0\), leading to eigenvalues \( \pm 1 \).

3. **eigenvalues of the hamiltonian**:
   - the hamiltonian \(h\) is given by \( \varepsilon \) times \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\). since \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) has eigenvalues \(+1\) and \(-1\), scaling by \(\varepsilon\) results in eigenvalues \( \varepsilon \) and \( -\varepsilon \).

thus, the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian operator are \( +\varepsilon \) and \( -\varepsilon \).
