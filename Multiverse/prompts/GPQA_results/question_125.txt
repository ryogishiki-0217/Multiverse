Okay, so I need to solve this quantum mechanics problem about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential.
The question is asking for the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (which I think refers to the degeneracy) for that energy.
Let me break this down step by step.
First, the potential given is V(r) = 1/2 m ω2 r2.
That's the potential for a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator.
In quantum mechanics, I remember that the energy levels for a 3D harmonic oscillator are different from the one-dimensional case.
Let me recall how they work.
In one dimension, the energy levels are E_n = (n + 1/2) ħω, where n = 0, 1, 2, ...
But in three dimensions, when it's isotropic (meaning the potential is the same in all directions), the energy levels become E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the total quantum number.
Wait, no, maybe that's not exactly right.
Wait, in three dimensions, the Hamiltonian separates into radial and angular parts.
The energy levels actually depend on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction.
Let me think.
For a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the potential is V(r) = (1/2)mω2r2, which in Cartesian coordinates is V(x,y,z) = (1/2)mω2(x2 + y2 + z2).
So, the Schrödinger equation can be separated into three one-dimensional harmonic oscillators along each axis.
Therefore, the total energy should be the sum of the energies along each direction.
So if in 1D, the energy levels are E_n = (n + 1/2) ħω, then in 3D, the total energy would be the sum for each direction.
So, E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + 1/2)ħω + (n_y + 1/2)ħω + (n_z + 1/2)ħω.
That simplifies to E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2)ħω.
So the total energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction, plus 3/2.
So the total quantum number n is n = n_x + n_y + n_z.
Therefore, E = (n + 3/2) ħω.
So each energy level is labeled by n, which is the sum of the three quantum numbers.
Then the energy is (n + 3/2)ħω.
The ground state is n=0 (n_x=n_y=n_z=0), E = (0 + 3/2)ħω = (3/2)ħω.
The first excited state would be n=1.
How many states correspond to n=1?
We need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = 1.
That's 3 combinations: (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1).
So degeneracy is 3.
So the first excited state has energy (1 + 3/2)ħω = (5/2)ħω, with degeneracy 3.
The second excited state would be n=2.
Solving n_x + n_y + n_z = 2.
The number of states here is the combination with repetition, which is (2 + 3 -1) choose 2, which is 6 choose 2 = 10?
Wait, the formula for the number of non-negative integer solutions is (n + k -1) choose (k -1)), where n is the total sum, and k is the number of variables.
Here, k=3 (n_x, n_y, n_z), so the degeneracy for n=2 would be (2 + 3 -1 choose 2) = (4 choose 2) = 6.
Wait, but wait.
Wait, no.
Wait, the formula is (n + k -1) choose (k -1).
So for n=2, k=3: (2 +3 -1) choose (3 -1)) = 4 choose 2 = 6.
So 6 states.
But let's check manually: for n=2, possible combinations:
(2,0,0), (0,2,0), (0,0,2), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1).
That's 6 states.
So yes, degeneracy is 6.
So the energy for n=2 is (2 + 3/2)ħω = (7/2)ħω.
Then the third excited state would be n=3?
Wait, let me make sure.
The ground state is n=0, E=3/2 ħω.
First excited state: n=1, E=5/2 ħω, degeneracy 3.
Second excited state: n=2, E=7/2 ħω, degeneracy 6.
Third excited state: n=3, E=9/2 ħω.
Wait, but wait.
The problem says "third excited state".
Let me confirm the numbering.
The states are:
n=0: ground state.
n=1: first excited state.
n=2: second excited state.
n=3: third excited state.
So then the energy would be (3 + 3/2)ħω = 9/2 ħω.
So that's the energy.
So looking at the options, C and D have 9/2 ħω, while A and B have something with π2ħ2/(2mr2).
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: Determine the physical interpretation of the expression π²ħ²/(2mr²).
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: Identify the formula for the energy of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The expression π²ħ²/(2mr²) resembles the formula for the energy of a particle in a 3D box, which is typically of the form (n_x² + n_y² + n_z²)π²ħ²/(2mL²). This similarity raises the question of whether the problem might involve a particle in a 3D box rather than a harmonic oscillator. The given potential V(r) = (1/2)mω²r², however, is characteristic of a harmonic oscillator. This contradiction suggests that the π²ħ²/(2mr²) term in options A and B is not consistent with the harmonic oscillator model described in the problem.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The energy of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is given by the formula (n + 3/2)ħω.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The expression π²ħ²/(2mr²) is associated with a 3D box potential, which is inconsistent with the harmonic oscillator potential V(r) = (1/2)mω²r². The correct energy formula for the given harmonic oscillator system is E = (n + 3/2)ħω.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So options A and B can be eliminated because they have an expression involving π2 and r2, which is not the form for harmonic oscillator energy.
So the answer must be either C or D.
Now, the energy for the third excited state, which is n=3, is (3 + 3/2)ħω = 9/2 ħω.
So that matches options C and D.
Now the second part of the question: how many linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) are there for this energy?
For n=3, the total quantum number is n=3, which is the sum of n_x, n_y, n_z.
Each of n_x, n_y, n_z must be non-negative integers.
So the number of possible combinations is the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = 3.
Using the combination formula: (n + k -1, n) = (3 +3 -1, 3) = (5,3) = 10.
So 10 states.
Let's check manually: For example, (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3), (2,1,0) and permutations.
Let's list them:
- (3,0,0): and permutations: 3 states.
- (2,1,0): permutations: 3!/(2!1!0!) = 6 states.
- (1,1,1): 1 state.
So total 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.
So degeneracy is 10.
Therefore, the energy is 9/2 ħω, and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions is 10.
So the correct answer is D: (9/2) ħω, 10.
Wait, but wait.
Hold on.
In 3D harmonic oscillator, is there any additional degeneracy from the angular part?
Wait, in the harmonic oscillator, the energy doesn't depend on the angular momentum.
Wait, but the eigenstates are classified by both the radial quantum number and the angular momentum (l), but for the energy levels we have E_n = (n + 3/2)ħω, where n is the total number of nodes (n = n_r + l + 3/2 or something else?).
Wait, maybe I need to recall the exact formula.
Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.
Wait, perhaps I confused the quantum numbers.
Let me think again.
In 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels can be labeled by the principal quantum number n = n_x + n_y + n_z, each n_x, n_y, n_z can be 0,1,2,...
So the energy is E_n = (n + 3/2) ħω.
However, each state is also described by angular momentum quantum numbers l and m.
But the thing is, the harmonic oscillator potential is spherically symmetric, but the separation of variables in Cartesian coordinates (x,y,z) leads to the n_x, n_y, n_z quantum numbers, while the separation in spherical coordinates leads to l and m.
So there's a connection between the two quantum number systems.
But for energy levels, since the potential is quadratic, the energy only depends on the sum n_x + n_y + n_z.
However, the connection to angular momentum arises because the Laplacian in spherical coordinates leads to angular and radial parts.
But in the case of the harmonic oscillator, the potential term is r2, which is rotationally invariant.
So the eigenstates can also be labeled by the total angular momentum l and the radial quantum number n_r.
The relation between the two labeling schemes (Cartesian vs. spherical) leads to the same energy levels, but with different quantum numbers.
However, the total number of states for a given n is (n + 3 -1, n) = (n + 2, 2).
But in the Cartesian coordinates, it's (n_x, n_y, n_z), each >=0, summing to n.
So the degeneracy is indeed (n + 2 choose 2).
For n=0: 1 state.
n=1: 3 states.
n=2: 6 states.
n=3: 10 states.
So for the third excited state (n=3), there are 10 eigenstates.
So the degeneracy is 10.
Therefore, the answer should have energy (n + 3/2)ħω = (3 + 3/2)ħω = 9/2 ħω and degeneracy 10.
So option D: (9/2) ħω, 10.
Wait, but another thought: sometimes in harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given as E_n = (n + 3/2)ħω where n is the principal quantum number, but n starts from 0.
So the ground state is n=0 (E=3/2 ħω), first excited state n=1 (E=5/2 ħω), etc.
However, when they ask for the "third excited state," does that mean n=3?
Wait, counting:
n=0: ground state
n=1: first excited state
n=2: second excited state
n=3: third excited state
So yes, n=3.
Therefore, E=9/2 ħω.
Then the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions is the degeneracy, which is (n + 2 choose 2) = (5,3)=10.
So 10.
So answer D.
But wait, another point: when considering angular momentum, for each l, there are 2l +1 states.
But in the harmonic oscillator, the energy doesn't depend on l.
So the degeneracy from angular momentum would be sum over l for a given n of (2l +1).
Wait, but maybe this is more complicated.
Wait, maybe there's a double counting here.
Wait, in the Cartesian coordinate system, the degeneracy comes from different combinations of n_x, n_y, n_z.
But in spherical coordinates, the eigenstates are characterized by quantum numbers n, l, m, where n is the radial quantum number.
But for the harmonic oscillator, the energy levels can be labeled by n = n_r + l + something.
Wait, perhaps I need to recall the exact formula.
Wait, actually, for the 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are E_n = (n + 3/2)ħω, where n = n_x + n_y + n_z, but when switching to polar coordinates, the wavefunction can be written in terms of radial and angular parts.
The connection between the Cartesian quantum numbers (n_x, n_y, n_z) and the angular momentum quantum number l is that the angular part of the wavefunction corresponds to a specific l.
For example, a state with two quantum numbers increased by 1 in two coordinates, like (n_x=1, n_y=1, n_z=0) would correspond to l=2?
Wait, maybe not.
Let me think.
Wait, in the harmonic oscillator, each quantum number n_x, n_y, n_z corresponds to a specific mode of oscillation.
The angular momentum quantum number l is related to the angular dependence of the wavefunction.
For example, a state with n_x=1, n_y=0, n_z=0 (which is the first excited state in the x-direction) is a state with l=1 (p-wave), since it has angular dependence proportional to x, which in spherical coordinates is r sinθ cosφ, so that's an l=1 state.
Similarly, the state with n_x=0, n_y=1, n_z=0 would correspond to y, which is r sinθ sinφ, also l=1, and similarly for z.
So in the first excited state (n=1), all three states have l=1.
Therefore, the degeneracy is three, which is from the three Cartesian directions.
But in terms of angular momentum, l=1, and each l=1 state has m=-1,0,1.
But in the Cartesian picture, each state with n_x=1, others zero gives l=1, but only m=1, 0, -1 corresponding to x, y, z?
Wait, x corresponds to m=0?
Wait, x is not spherical harmonics, so maybe there's a connection here.
Wait, actually, the Cartesian harmonic oscillator eigenstates can be combined to form states with definite angular momentum.
For example, the state with n_x=1, n_y=0, n_z=0 (which is an l=1, m= -1, 0, or 1?) Wait, no.
Actually, in Cartesian coordinates, these states don't have a well-defined angular momentum.
Wait, actually, x, y, z are proportional to spherical harmonics of degree 1.
The x, y, z coordinates correspond to the Cartesian components, but when transformed to spherical coordinates, x ∝ r sinθ cosφ, which is Y_1^1 + Y_1^{-1} or something?
Wait, actually, the Cartesian coordinates correspond to the real spherical harmonics of degree 1.
So for example, the state with n_x=1, n_y=0, n_z=0 is proportional to x, which in spherical coordinates is r sinθ cosφ, which is a combination of l=1, m=1 and m=-1.
But the point is, each Cartesian direction in the first excited state (n=1) actually has angular momentum l=1.
Therefore, the three states (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1) each have l=1, but they are not eigenstates of L_z or with definite m.
However, when you consider linear combinations of them, you can form states with definite m.
But in any case, the degeneracy comes from the three Cartesian directions, which correspond to the three m values (-1, 0, 1) for l=1.
Therefore, the degeneracy for n=1 is 3, matching both pictures.
Similarly, for n=2, the possible combinations of (n_x, n_y, n_z) summing to 2.
These include:
- (2,0,0), (0,2,0), (0,0,2) : 3 states.
- (1,1,0), permutations: 3 states.
So total 6 states.
In terms of angular momentum, these 6 states can be decomposed into different l values.
The three states (2,0,0), etc., each have l=2 (since x2, y2, z2 are related to r2 times spherical harmonics of order l=2).
Wait, actually, x2 is proportional to (Y_2^2 + Y_2^{-2}) something like that, but not exactly.
Wait, actually, the spherical harmonics of degree l=2 are related to the real spherical harmonics which can be expressed in terms of x2, y2, z2, and cross terms.
But the actual decomposition of the Cartesian states into angular momentum states is more complicated.
However, the key point is that the total Hilbert space for n=2 in the harmonic oscillator has a degeneracy of 6.
When decomposed into angular momentum states, this 6-dimensional space splits into an l=0 part and an l=2 part.
Wait, but how?
Wait, the 6 states for n=2 in Cartesian coordinates are:
1. x2 - y2 (which is related to Y_2^0),
2. xy (related to Y_2^2 or Y_2^{-2}),
3. xz (similarly),
4. yz,
5. x2 + y2,
Wait, maybe I need to recall the standard decomposition.
Wait, in the two-photon Laporte rule or similar, the n=2 states (quadrupole transitions) involve l changes.
But perhaps that's not helpful here.
Alternatively, considering the connection between the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions and the angular momentum degeneracy.
But maybe that's more complex.
Alternatively, in the shell model for the harmonic oscillator, each spherical harmonic oscillator shell n has a degeneracy of (n + 1)(n + 2)/2 for 3D?
Wait, no.
Wait, the degeneracy for a 3D harmonic oscillator for a given n (n = n_x + n_y + n_z) is indeed (n + 1)(n + 2)/2?
Wait, for n=0, that's 1.
n=1, (2)(3)/2=3; n=2, (3)(4)/2=6; n=3, (4)(5)/2=10.
Yes, that matches the combinatorial result.
So each n=3 gives 10 states.
Therefore, regardless of the angular momentum decomposition, the total number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) is 10.
So the answer is D: (9/2) ħω, 10.
Therefore, even though when considering angular momentum, different l values may be present, the total number of states for n=3 is 10.
So the answer is D.
Wait, but let me check once again.
The problem says "the third excited state".
Is n=3 indeed the third excited state?
Let's list them:
n=0: ground state, E=3/2 ħω, degeneracy 1.
n=1: first excited state, E=5/2 ħω, degeneracy 3.
n=2: second excited state, E=7/2 ħω, degeneracy 6.
n=3: third excited state, E=9/2 ħω, degeneracy 10.
Therefore, yes.
So the energy is 9/2 ħω, and degeneracy is 10.
Thus, the answer is D.
Looking back at the options, option D is (9/2) ħω , 10.
So the answer is D.
</Think>

Answer: The problem involves a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, \( V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2 \). We need to determine the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) for that energy.

1. **Energy Levels of a 3D Harmonic Oscillator**:
   - The energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by \( E_n = \left(n + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega \), where \( n = n_x + n_y + n_z \) is the total quantum number.
   - The ground state (\( n = 0 \)) has energy \( \frac{3}{2} \hbar \omega \).
   - The first excited state (\( n = 1 \)) has energy \( \frac{5}{2} \hbar \omega \).
   - The second excited state (\( n = 2 \)) has energy \( \frac{7}{2} \hbar \omega \).
   - The third excited state (\( n = 3 \)) has energy \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \).

2. **Degeneracy Calculation**:
   - The degeneracy for each energy level \( n \) is determined by the number of non-negative integer solutions to \( n_x + n_y + n_z = n \), which is given by \( \binom{n + 2}{2} \).
   - For \( n = 3 \), the degeneracy is \( \binom{3 + 2}{2} = \binom{5}{2} = 10 \).

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The energy of the third excited state is \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \).
   - The degeneracy (number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) for this energy is 10.

The final answer is \(\boxed{D}\).

okay, so i need to solve this quantum mechanics problem about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential.
the question is asking for the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (which i think refers to the degeneracy) for that energy.
let me break this down step by step.
first, the potential given is v(r) = 1/2 m ω2 r2.
that's the potential for a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator.
in quantum mechanics, i remember that the energy levels for a 3d harmonic oscillator are different from the one-dimensional case.
let me recall how they work.
in one dimension, the energy levels are e_n = (n + 1/2) ħω, where n = 0, 1, 2, ...
but in three dimensions, when it's isotropic (meaning the potential is the same in all directions), the energy levels become e = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the total quantum number.
wait, no, maybe that's not exactly right.
wait, in three dimensions, the hamiltonian separates into radial and angular parts.
the energy levels actually depend on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction.
let me think.
for a 3d isotropic harmonic oscillator, the potential is v(r) = (1/2)mω2r2, which in cartesian coordinates is v(x,y,z) = (1/2)mω2(x2 + y2 + z2).
so, the schrödinger equation can be separated into three one-dimensional harmonic oscillators along each axis.
therefore, the total energy should be the sum of the energies along each direction.
so if in 1d, the energy levels are e_n = (n + 1/2) ħω, then in 3d, the total energy would be the sum for each direction.
so, e_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = (n_x + 1/2)ħω + (n_y + 1/2)ħω + (n_z + 1/2)ħω.
that simplifies to e = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2)ħω.
so the total energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction, plus 3/2.
so the total quantum number n is n = n_x + n_y + n_z.
therefore, e = (n + 3/2) ħω.
so each energy level is labeled by n, which is the sum of the three quantum numbers.
then the energy is (n + 3/2)ħω.
the ground state is n=0 (n_x=n_y=n_z=0), e = (0 + 3/2)ħω = (3/2)ħω.
the first excited state would be n=1.
how many states correspond to n=1?
we need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = 1.
that's 3 combinations: (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1).
so degeneracy is 3.
so the first excited state has energy (1 + 3/2)ħω = (5/2)ħω, with degeneracy 3.
the second excited state would be n=2.
solving n_x + n_y + n_z = 2.
the number of states here is the combination with repetition, which is (2 + 3 -1) choose 2, which is 6 choose 2 = 10?
wait, the formula for the number of non-negative integer solutions is (n + k -1) choose (k -1)), where n is the total sum, and k is the number of variables.
here, k=3 (n_x, n_y, n_z), so the degeneracy for n=2 would be (2 + 3 -1 choose 2) = (4 choose 2) = 6.
wait, but wait.
wait, no.
wait, the formula is (n + k -1) choose (k -1).
so for n=2, k=3: (2 +3 -1) choose (3 -1)) = 4 choose 2 = 6.
so 6 states.
but let's check manually: for n=2, possible combinations:
(2,0,0), (0,2,0), (0,0,2), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1).
that's 6 states.
so yes, degeneracy is 6.
so the energy for n=2 is (2 + 3/2)ħω = (7/2)ħω.
then the third excited state would be n=3?
wait, let me make sure.
the ground state is n=0, e=3/2 ħω.
first excited state: n=1, e=5/2 ħω, degeneracy 3.
second excited state: n=2, e=7/2 ħω, degeneracy 6.
third excited state: n=3, e=9/2 ħω.
wait, but wait.
the problem says "third excited state".
let me confirm the numbering.
the states are:
n=0: ground state.
n=1: first excited state.
n=2: second excited state.
n=3: third excited state.
so then the energy would be (3 + 3/2)ħω = 9/2 ħω.
so that's the energy.
so looking at the options, c and d have 9/2 ħω, while a and b have something with π2ħ2/(2mr2).

<conclusion>
the expression π²ħ²/(2mr²) is associated with a 3d box potential, which is inconsistent with the harmonic oscillator potential v(r) = (1/2)mω²r². the correct energy formula for the given harmonic oscillator system is e = (n + 3/2)ħω.
</conclusion>

so options a and b can be eliminated because they have an expression involving π2 and r2, which is not the form for harmonic oscillator energy.
so the answer must be either c or d.
now, the energy for the third excited state, which is n=3, is (3 + 3/2)ħω = 9/2 ħω.
so that matches options c and d.
now the second part of the question: how many linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) are there for this energy?
for n=3, the total quantum number is n=3, which is the sum of n_x, n_y, n_z.
each of n_x, n_y, n_z must be non-negative integers.
so the number of possible combinations is the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = 3.
using the combination formula: (n + k -1, n) = (3 +3 -1, 3) = (5,3) = 10.
so 10 states.
let's check manually: for example, (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3), (2,1,0) and permutations.
let's list them:
- (3,0,0): and permutations: 3 states.
- (2,1,0): permutations: 3!/(2!1!0!) = 6 states.
- (1,1,1): 1 state.
so total 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.
so degeneracy is 10.
therefore, the energy is 9/2 ħω, and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions is 10.
so the correct answer is d: (9/2) ħω, 10.
wait, but wait.
hold on.
in 3d harmonic oscillator, is there any additional degeneracy from the angular part?
wait, in the harmonic oscillator, the energy doesn't depend on the angular momentum.
wait, but the eigenstates are classified by both the radial quantum number and the angular momentum (l), but for the energy levels we have e_n = (n + 3/2)ħω, where n is the total number of nodes (n = n_r + l + 3/2 or something else?).
wait, maybe i need to recall the exact formula.
wait, maybe i made a mistake here.
wait, perhaps i confused the quantum numbers.
let me think again.
in 3d harmonic oscillator, the energy levels can be labeled by the principal quantum number n = n_x + n_y + n_z, each n_x, n_y, n_z can be 0,1,2,...
so the energy is e_n = (n + 3/2) ħω.
however, each state is also described by angular momentum quantum numbers l and m.
but the thing is, the harmonic oscillator potential is spherically symmetric, but the separation of variables in cartesian coordinates (x,y,z) leads to the n_x, n_y, n_z quantum numbers, while the separation in spherical coordinates leads to l and m.
so there's a connection between the two quantum number systems.
but for energy levels, since the potential is quadratic, the energy only depends on the sum n_x + n_y + n_z.
however, the connection to angular momentum arises because the laplacian in spherical coordinates leads to angular and radial parts.
but in the case of the harmonic oscillator, the potential term is r2, which is rotationally invariant.
so the eigenstates can also be labeled by the total angular momentum l and the radial quantum number n_r.
the relation between the two labeling schemes (cartesian vs. spherical) leads to the same energy levels, but with different quantum numbers.
however, the total number of states for a given n is (n + 3 -1, n) = (n + 2, 2).
but in the cartesian coordinates, it's (n_x, n_y, n_z), each >=0, summing to n.
so the degeneracy is indeed (n + 2 choose 2).
for n=0: 1 state.
n=1: 3 states.
n=2: 6 states.
n=3: 10 states.
so for the third excited state (n=3), there are 10 eigenstates.
so the degeneracy is 10.
therefore, the answer should have energy (n + 3/2)ħω = (3 + 3/2)ħω = 9/2 ħω and degeneracy 10.
so option d: (9/2) ħω, 10.
wait, but another thought: sometimes in harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given as e_n = (n + 3/2)ħω where n is the principal quantum number, but n starts from 0.
so the ground state is n=0 (e=3/2 ħω), first excited state n=1 (e=5/2 ħω), etc.
however, when they ask for the "third excited state," does that mean n=3?
wait, counting:
n=0: ground state
n=1: first excited state
n=2: second excited state
n=3: third excited state
so yes, n=3.
therefore, e=9/2 ħω.
then the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions is the degeneracy, which is (n + 2 choose 2) = (5,3)=10.
so 10.
so answer d.
but wait, another point: when considering angular momentum, for each l, there are 2l +1 states.
but in the harmonic oscillator, the energy doesn't depend on l.
so the degeneracy from angular momentum would be sum over l for a given n of (2l +1).
wait, but maybe this is more complicated.
wait, maybe there's a double counting here.
wait, in the cartesian coordinate system, the degeneracy comes from different combinations of n_x, n_y, n_z.
but in spherical coordinates, the eigenstates are characterized by quantum numbers n, l, m, where n is the radial quantum number.
but for the harmonic oscillator, the energy levels can be labeled by n = n_r + l + something.
wait, perhaps i need to recall the exact formula.
wait, actually, for the 3d harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are e_n = (n + 3/2)ħω, where n = n_x + n_y + n_z, but when switching to polar coordinates, the wavefunction can be written in terms of radial and angular parts.
the connection between the cartesian quantum numbers (n_x, n_y, n_z) and the angular momentum quantum number l is that the angular part of the wavefunction corresponds to a specific l.
for example, a state with two quantum numbers increased by 1 in two coordinates, like (n_x=1, n_y=1, n_z=0) would correspond to l=2?
wait, maybe not.
let me think.
wait, in the harmonic oscillator, each quantum number n_x, n_y, n_z corresponds to a specific mode of oscillation.
the angular momentum quantum number l is related to the angular dependence of the wavefunction.
for example, a state with n_x=1, n_y=0, n_z=0 (which is the first excited state in the x-direction) is a state with l=1 (p-wave), since it has angular dependence proportional to x, which in spherical coordinates is r sinθ cosφ, so that's an l=1 state.
similarly, the state with n_x=0, n_y=1, n_z=0 would correspond to y, which is r sinθ sinφ, also l=1, and similarly for z.
so in the first excited state (n=1), all three states have l=1.
therefore, the degeneracy is three, which is from the three cartesian directions.
but in terms of angular momentum, l=1, and each l=1 state has m=-1,0,1.
but in the cartesian picture, each state with n_x=1, others zero gives l=1, but only m=1, 0, -1 corresponding to x, y, z?
wait, x corresponds to m=0?
wait, x is not spherical harmonics, so maybe there's a connection here.
wait, actually, the cartesian harmonic oscillator eigenstates can be combined to form states with definite angular momentum.
for example, the state with n_x=1, n_y=0, n_z=0 (which is an l=1, m= -1, 0, or 1?) wait, no.
actually, in cartesian coordinates, these states don't have a well-defined angular momentum.
wait, actually, x, y, z are proportional to spherical harmonics of degree 1.
the x, y, z coordinates correspond to the cartesian components, but when transformed to spherical coordinates, x ∝ r sinθ cosφ, which is y_1^1 + y_1^{-1} or something?
wait, actually, the cartesian coordinates correspond to the real spherical harmonics of degree 1.
so for example, the state with n_x=1, n_y=0, n_z=0 is proportional to x, which in spherical coordinates is r sinθ cosφ, which is a combination of l=1, m=1 and m=-1.
but the point is, each cartesian direction in the first excited state (n=1) actually has angular momentum l=1.
therefore, the three states (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1) each have l=1, but they are not eigenstates of l_z or with definite m.
however, when you consider linear combinations of them, you can form states with definite m.
but in any case, the degeneracy comes from the three cartesian directions, which correspond to the three m values (-1, 0, 1) for l=1.
therefore, the degeneracy for n=1 is 3, matching both pictures.
similarly, for n=2, the possible combinations of (n_x, n_y, n_z) summing to 2.
these include:
- (2,0,0), (0,2,0), (0,0,2) : 3 states.
- (1,1,0), permutations: 3 states.
so total 6 states.
in terms of angular momentum, these 6 states can be decomposed into different l values.
the three states (2,0,0), etc., each have l=2 (since x2, y2, z2 are related to r2 times spherical harmonics of order l=2).
wait, actually, x2 is proportional to (y_2^2 + y_2^{-2}) something like that, but not exactly.
wait, actually, the spherical harmonics of degree l=2 are related to the real spherical harmonics which can be expressed in terms of x2, y2, z2, and cross terms.
but the actual decomposition of the cartesian states into angular momentum states is more complicated.
however, the key point is that the total hilbert space for n=2 in the harmonic oscillator has a degeneracy of 6.
when decomposed into angular momentum states, this 6-dimensional space splits into an l=0 part and an l=2 part.
wait, but how?
wait, the 6 states for n=2 in cartesian coordinates are:
1. x2 - y2 (which is related to y_2^0),
2. xy (related to y_2^2 or y_2^{-2}),
3. xz (similarly),
4. yz,
5. x2 + y2,
wait, maybe i need to recall the standard decomposition.
wait, in the two-photon laporte rule or similar, the n=2 states (quadrupole transitions) involve l changes.
but perhaps that's not helpful here.
alternatively, considering the connection between the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions and the angular momentum degeneracy.
but maybe that's more complex.
alternatively, in the shell model for the harmonic oscillator, each spherical harmonic oscillator shell n has a degeneracy of (n + 1)(n + 2)/2 for 3d?
wait, no.
wait, the degeneracy for a 3d harmonic oscillator for a given n (n = n_x + n_y + n_z) is indeed (n + 1)(n + 2)/2?
wait, for n=0, that's 1.
n=1, (2)(3)/2=3; n=2, (3)(4)/2=6; n=3, (4)(5)/2=10.
yes, that matches the combinatorial result.
so each n=3 gives 10 states.
therefore, regardless of the angular momentum decomposition, the total number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) is 10.
so the answer is d: (9/2) ħω, 10.
therefore, even though when considering angular momentum, different l values may be present, the total number of states for n=3 is 10.
so the answer is d.
wait, but let me check once again.
the problem says "the third excited state".
is n=3 indeed the third excited state?
let's list them:
n=0: ground state, e=3/2 ħω, degeneracy 1.
n=1: first excited state, e=5/2 ħω, degeneracy 3.
n=2: second excited state, e=7/2 ħω, degeneracy 6.
n=3: third excited state, e=9/2 ħω, degeneracy 10.
therefore, yes.
so the energy is 9/2 ħω, and degeneracy is 10.
thus, the answer is d.
looking back at the options, option d is (9/2) ħω , 10.
so the answer is d.

answer: the problem involves a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, \( v(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2 \). we need to determine the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) for that energy.

1. **energy levels of a 3d harmonic oscillator**:
   - the energy levels for a 3d isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by \( e_n = \left(n + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega \), where \( n = n_x + n_y + n_z \) is the total quantum number.
   - the ground state (\( n = 0 \)) has energy \( \frac{3}{2} \hbar \omega \).
   - the first excited state (\( n = 1 \)) has energy \( \frac{5}{2} \hbar \omega \).
   - the second excited state (\( n = 2 \)) has energy \( \frac{7}{2} \hbar \omega \).
   - the third excited state (\( n = 3 \)) has energy \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \).

2. **degeneracy calculation**:
   - the degeneracy for each energy level \( n \) is determined by the number of non-negative integer solutions to \( n_x + n_y + n_z = n \), which is given by \( \binom{n + 2}{2} \).
   - for \( n = 3 \), the degeneracy is \( \binom{3 + 2}{2} = \binom{5}{2} = 10 \).

3. **conclusion**:
   - the energy of the third excited state is \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \).
   - the degeneracy (number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) for this energy is 10.

the final answer is \(\boxed{d}\)
