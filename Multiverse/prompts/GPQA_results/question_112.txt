Okay, let's try to solve this quantum mechanics problem step by step.
The question is about an electron in a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>.
First, I need to remember that quantum states are defined up to a normalization constant.
So, even though the problem says "proportional to", we need to normalize the state vector to calculate probabilities.
Let me write down the state as |alpha> = N[(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>], where N is the normalization constant.
To find N, we need to compute the inner product <alpha|alpha> = 1.
Calculating the norm squared: |N|^2 [ |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 ].
The coefficients for |up> and |down> are (1+i) and (2-i), respectively.
The norm squared of (1+i) is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2, and the norm squared of (2-i) is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1 =5.
So, |N|^2*(2 + 5) = |N|^2*7.
This should equal 1, so |N|^2 = 1/7, hence |N| = 1/√7.
Since overall phase doesn't matter, we can take N as 1/√7.
Therefore, the normalized state |alpha> is (1/√7)[(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>].
Now, the next part asks to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of some operator A, whose matrix elements are given as A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise.
So, since it's a 2x2 matrix, the operator A would be: [0, ħ/2; ħ/2, 0].
This resembles the x-component of the Pauli matrix, σ_x, scaled by ħ/2.
Indeed, σ_x is [[0, 1], [1, 0]], so (ħ/2)σ_x would have elements [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].
That matches the given A_ij.
So, the operator in question is (ħ/2)σ_x.
The eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates of the x-component of spin.
Each corresponding to eigenvalues +1 and -1 (in units of ħ/2).
So the actual eigenvalues of the operator A are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.
But to calculate the probabilities, we need to express |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A.
Since A is σ_x scaled by ħ/2, its eigenstates are the same as those of σ_x.
The eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> = (1/√2)(|up> + |down>) and |-x> = (1/√2)(|up> - |down>).
Wait, actually, that's for σ_x.
Let me confirm.
The eigenstates of σ_x are indeed |+x> = 1/√2 (|up> + |down>) and |-x> = 1/√2 (|up> - |down>).
But wait, is that correct?
Let me double-check.
If we act σ_x on |+x>, we should get +1 times |+x>.
Let's compute σ_x(|up> + |down>) = |down> + |up>, which is the same as the original state.
So eigenvalue +1.
Similarly, for |-x>, σ_x(|up> - |down>) = |down> - |up> = -(|up> - |down>) = -|-x>.
Wait, no.
Wait, σ_x applied to |-x> as (|up> - |down>) would give |down> - |up> = -(|up> - |down>) so that's eigenvalue -1.
So yes, the eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> = 1/√2 (|up> + |down>) with eigenvalue +1, and |-x> = 1/√2 (|up> - |down>) with eigenvalue -1.
Since operator A is (ħ/2)σ_x, the eigenvalues are ħ/2 times those, so +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.
But the eigenstates are the same as those of σ_x.
Therefore, to find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates of A, we need to expand |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, and then the probabilities are the squares of the absolute values of the coefficients.
So, first, let's express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.
We have |alpha> = (1/√7)[(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>].
Let me write |+x> = 1/√2 (|up> + |down>), and |-x> = 1/√2 (|up> - |down>).
Let's solve for |up> and |down> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.
From linear algebra, we can write: |up> = 1/√2 (|+x> + |-x>) |down> = 1/√2 (|+x> - |-x>)
Let me substitute these into |alpha>.
So, substituting |up> and |down>:
|alpha> = (1/√7)[(1+i) * (1/√2)(|+x> + |-x>) + (2-i) * (1/√2)(|+x> - |-x>)]
Let me factor out 1/√2:
|alpha> = (1/√7)(1/√2)[ (1+i)(|+x> + |-x>) + (2-i)(|+x> - |-x>) ]
Now, distribute the terms:
First, multiply (1+i) through:
(1+i)|+x> + (1+i)|-x>
Then, multiply (2-i) through:
(2-i)|+x> - (2-i)|-x>
Now, combine the terms:
[ (1+i) + (2-i) ] |+x> + [ (1+i) - (2 - i) ] |-x>
Compute the coefficients:
Let's think in parallel.

<Outline>
1: The coefficient for the |+x> component.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: The coefficient for the |-x> component.

<Path>
1: The coefficient for the |+x> component is calculated as (1+i) + (2-i), which simplifies to 1 + 2 + i - i, resulting in 3.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The |-x> component's coefficient is (1+i) - (2 - i), which simplifies to 1 + i - 2 + i, resulting in -1 + 2i.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The coefficient for |+x> is 3, and the coefficient for |-x> is -1 + 2i.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So, the expression becomes:
|alpha> = (1/√7)(1/√2)[ 3 |+x> + (-1 + 2i)|-x> ]
Simplify the constants:
1/√7 * 1/√2 = 1/√14
So, |alpha> = 1/√14 [ 3 |+x> + (-1 + 2i)|-x> ]
Now, the probability of measuring |+x> is the square of the absolute value of the coefficient 3, multiplied by (1/√14)^2, and similarly for |-x> with coefficient (-1 + 2i).
Wait, no.
Actually, the coefficients in front of |+x> and |-x> are complex numbers multiplied by 1/√14.
Let me write the state vector as:
|alpha> = 1/√14 [ 3 |+x> + (-1 + 2i)|-x> ]
So, the coefficient for |+x> is 3/√14, and for |-x> is (-1 + 2i)/√14.
Therefore, the probability for |+x> is |3/√14|^2 and for |-x> is |(-1 + 2i)/√14|^2.
Calculate the probability for |+x>:
Let's think in parallel.

1: The probability P(|+x>) is determined by the square of the absolute value of the coefficient 3/√14. The absolute value squared of 3/√14 is calculated as (3/√14)(3/√14), which equals 9/14. Therefore, P(|+x>) is 9/14, or approximately 0.64.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The probability for the |-x> state is given by the squared magnitude of its coefficient. This coefficient is (-1 + 2i)/√14, so the squared magnitude is |(-1 + 2i)/√14|². The squared magnitude of the numerator (-1 + 2i) is computed as (-1)² + (2)², which equals 1 + 4 = 5. Dividing by |√14|² = 14 yields 5/14. Therefore, the probability P(|-x>) is 5/14.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The probability of measuring the state |+x> is 9/14, and the probability of measuring the state |-x> is 5/14.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So, the probabilities are 9/14 ≈ 0.6428 for |+x> and 5/14 ≈ 0.3571 for |-x>.
Looking at the options, A) 0.54, 0.46; B) 0.64, 0.36; C) 0.28, 0.72; D) 0.61, 0.29.
So, 9/14 is exactly 0.642857..., which is approximately 0.64, and 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is closest to 0.36.
So, the probabilities would correspond to B) 0.64 and 0.36.
Wait, but 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is 0.357, so rounding to two decimal places, 0.36.
So that's 0.64 and 0.36.
That's the first part.
The second part is to find the average value of the operator A.
The average value is <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.
Since A is Hermitian, the average value should be a real number.
Given that |alpha> is already expressed in terms of the eigenstates of A, we can use the expansion we just did.
The expectation value is the sum of the probabilities of each eigenstate multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues.
Since the eigenvalues of A are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2 for |+x> and |-x>, respectively.
Therefore, <A> = (probability of |+x>) * (ħ/2) + (probability of |-x>) * (-ħ/2)
Let's think in parallel.

Therefore, <A> = (9ħ/28 -5ħ/28) = (4ħ/28) = ħ/7.
So the average value is ħ/7.
Looking back at the options: A) 0.54, 0.46 and 3ħ/√7; B) 0.64, 0.36 and ħ/7; C) 0.28, 0.72 and ħ/√7; D) 0.61, 0.29 and 2ħ/√7.
The probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.64 and 5/14≈0.36, so B) has those.
Then the average is ħ/7, which is exactly the third option in B).
So the answer should be B.
Wait, but just to confirm, let's do it another way.
Alternatively, compute the expectation value using the original state and the operator A.
Let's verify.
Original state |alpha> is (1/√7)[(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>].
The operator A is (ħ/2)σ_x, whose matrix is [0, ħ/2; ħ/2, 0] in the |up>, |down> basis.
So, <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.
First, write |alpha> as a vector: |alpha> = 1/√7 [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ].
So, in vector form: 1/√7 * [ (1+i), (2 - i) ]^T.
The bra <alpha| is the Hermitian conjugate: 1/√7 [ (1 - i), (2 + i) ].
Then, compute <alpha| A |alpha>.
Matrix multiplication.
First, compute A |alpha>.
A is: [0, ħ/2; ħ/2, 0].
Multiplying A with |alpha>: ħ/2 * [ (2 - i), (1 + i) ]^T, scaled by 1/√7.
Wait, let's do it step by step.
Compute A |alpha>:
Row 1 of A is [0, ħ/2].
Multiply with |alpha> vector: 0*(1+i)/√7 + ħ/2*(2 - i)/√7 = ħ/2*(2 - i)/√7.
Row 2 of A is [ħ/2, 0].
Multiply with |alpha>: ħ/2*(1 + i)/√7 + 0 = ħ/2*(1 + i)/√7.
Therefore, A |alpha> = (ħ/2)/√7 [ (2 - i), (1 + i) ]^T.
Now, take the inner product with <alpha|: which is 1/√7 [ (1 - i), (2 + i) ].
So: <alpha| A |alpha> = 1/√7 [ (1 - i), (2 + i) ] • (ħ/2)/√7 [ (2 - i), (1 + i) ]^T = (ħ/2)/7 [ (1 - i)(2 - i) + (2 + i)(1 + i) ]
Compute the two terms:
First term: (1 - i)(2 - i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) -i*2 + (-i)*(-i) = 2 -i -2i + i^2 = 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.
Second term: (2 + i)(1 + i) = 2*1 + 2*i +i*1 + i*i = 2 +2i +i +i^2 = 2 +3i -1 = 1 + 3i.
Adding the two terms: (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) = 2.
Therefore, <alpha| A |alpha> = (ħ/2)/7 * 2 = (ħ/2)*(2/7) = ħ/7.
So that's correct.
Therefore, the average is ħ/7.
So the answer is B) 0.64, 0.36 and ħ/7.
Wait, but let me check the probabilities once more.
The coefficients when we expressed |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x> were 3 and (-1 + 2i).
Then the probabilities are |3/√14|^2 = 9/14 ≈0.642857 and |(-1 + 2i)/√14|^2 = (1^2 +2^2)/14 =5/14≈0.357.
So exactly 9/14 and 5/14, which sum to 14/14=1.
That's good.
So 9/14≈0.642857 which is 0.64 (option B lists 0.64 and 0.36; 0.36 is 5/14≈0.357).
Since the options have to round somewhere, 0.357 can be written as 0.36.
So B is correct.
Therefore, the answer is B.
**Final Answer**
\boxed{B}
</Think>

Answer: To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle \propto (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The normalization constant \( N \) is calculated as follows:

1. Calculate the norm squared of the coefficients:
   - \( |1+i|^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2 \)
   - \( |2-i|^2 = 2^2 + (-1)^2 = 5 \)

2. The normalization constant \( N \) is \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \), leading to the normalized state:
   \[
   |\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right)
   \]

Next, we express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of the eigenstates of the operator \( A \), which is proportional to the Pauli matrix \( \sigma_x \). The eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \) are \( |+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle) \) and \( |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle) \).

Substituting these into \( |\alpha\rangle \):
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+x\rangle + |-x\rangle) + (2-i)\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+x\rangle - |-x\rangle) \right)
\]

Combining the terms:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left( 3|+x\rangle + (-1 + 2i)|-x\rangle \right)
\]

The probabilities are calculated by taking the squared magnitudes of the coefficients:
- Probability of \( |+x\rangle \): \( \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64 \)
- Probability of \( |-x\rangle \): \( \left| \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36 \)

For the average value of the operator \( A \), we use the expectation value:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle
\]

Using the eigenvalues \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \) and their probabilities:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \left( \frac{9}{14} \right) \frac{\hbar}{2} + \left( \frac{5}{14} \right) \left( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \right) = \frac{\hbar}{7}
\]

Thus, the final answers are:
- Probabilities: \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \)
- Average value: \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \)

The correct choice is:
\boxed{B}

okay, let's try to solve this quantum mechanics problem step by step.
the question is about an electron in a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>.
first, i need to remember that quantum states are defined up to a normalization constant.
so, even though the problem says "proportional to", we need to normalize the state vector to calculate probabilities.
let me write down the state as |alpha> = n[(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>], where n is the normalization constant.
to find n, we need to compute the inner product <alpha|alpha> = 1.
calculating the norm squared: |n|^2 [ |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 ].
the coefficients for |up> and |down> are (1+i) and (2-i), respectively.
the norm squared of (1+i) is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2, and the norm squared of (2-i) is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1 =5.
so, |n|^2*(2 + 5) = |n|^2*7.
this should equal 1, so |n|^2 = 1/7, hence |n| = 1/√7.
since overall phase doesn't matter, we can take n as 1/√7.
therefore, the normalized state |alpha> is (1/√7)[(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>].
now, the next part asks to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of some operator a, whose matrix elements are given as a_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise.
so, since it's a 2x2 matrix, the operator a would be: [0, ħ/2; ħ/2, 0].
this resembles the x-component of the pauli matrix, σ_x, scaled by ħ/2.
indeed, σ_x is [[0, 1], [1, 0]], so (ħ/2)σ_x would have elements [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].
that matches the given a_ij.
so, the operator in question is (ħ/2)σ_x.
the eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates of the x-component of spin.
each corresponding to eigenvalues +1 and -1 (in units of ħ/2).
so the actual eigenvalues of the operator a are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.
but to calculate the probabilities, we need to express |alpha> in the eigenbasis of a.
since a is σ_x scaled by ħ/2, its eigenstates are the same as those of σ_x.
the eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> = (1/√2)(|up> + |down>) and |-x> = (1/√2)(|up> - |down>).
wait, actually, that's for σ_x.
let me confirm.
the eigenstates of σ_x are indeed |+x> = 1/√2 (|up> + |down>) and |-x> = 1/√2 (|up> - |down>).
but wait, is that correct?
let me double-check.
if we act σ_x on |+x>, we should get +1 times |+x>.
let's compute σ_x(|up> + |down>) = |down> + |up>, which is the same as the original state.
so eigenvalue +1.
similarly, for |-x>, σ_x(|up> - |down>) = |down> - |up> = -(|up> - |down>) = -|-x>.
wait, no.
wait, σ_x applied to |-x> as (|up> - |down>) would give |down> - |up> = -(|up> - |down>) so that's eigenvalue -1.
so yes, the eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> = 1/√2 (|up> + |down>) with eigenvalue +1, and |-x> = 1/√2 (|up> - |down>) with eigenvalue -1.
since operator a is (ħ/2)σ_x, the eigenvalues are ħ/2 times those, so +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.
but the eigenstates are the same as those of σ_x.
therefore, to find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates of a, we need to expand |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, and then the probabilities are the squares of the absolute values of the coefficients.
so, first, let's express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.
we have |alpha> = (1/√7)[(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>].
let me write |+x> = 1/√2 (|up> + |down>), and |-x> = 1/√2 (|up> - |down>).
let's solve for |up> and |down> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.
from linear algebra, we can write: |up> = 1/√2 (|+x> + |-x>) |down> = 1/√2 (|+x> - |-x>)
let me substitute these into |alpha>.
so, substituting |up> and |down>:
|alpha> = (1/√7)[(1+i) * (1/√2)(|+x> + |-x>) + (2-i) * (1/√2)(|+x> - |-x>)]
let me factor out 1/√2:
|alpha> = (1/√7)(1/√2)[ (1+i)(|+x> + |-x>) + (2-i)(|+x> - |-x>) ]
now, distribute the terms:
first, multiply (1+i) through:
(1+i)|+x> + (1+i)|-x>
then, multiply (2-i) through:
(2-i)|+x> - (2-i)|-x>

the coefficient for |+x> is 3, and the coefficient for |-x> is -1 + 2i.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
so, the expression becomes:
|alpha> = (1/√7)(1/√2)[ 3 |+x> + (-1 + 2i)|-x> ]
simplify the constants:
1/√7 * 1/√2 = 1/√14
so, |alpha> = 1/√14 [ 3 |+x> + (-1 + 2i)|-x> ]
now, the probability of measuring |+x> is the square of the absolute value of the coefficient 3, multiplied by (1/√14)^2, and similarly for |-x> with coefficient (-1 + 2i).
wait, no.
actually, the coefficients in front of |+x> and |-x> are complex numbers multiplied by 1/√14.
let me write the state vector as:
|alpha> = 1/√14 [ 3 |+x> + (-1 + 2i)|-x> ]
so, the coefficient for |+x> is 3/√14, and for |-x> is (-1 + 2i)/√14.
therefore, the probability for |+x> is |3/√14|^2 and for |-x> is |(-1 + 2i)/√14|^2.
calculate the probability for |+x>:
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>
<goal>
<outline>
1: the probability p(|+x>) is computed.
</outline>
<outline>
2: the probability p(|-x>) is computed.
</outline>
</goal>
<path>
1: the probability p(|+x>) is determined by the square of the absolute value of the coefficient 3/√14. the absolute value squared of 3/√14 is calculated as (3/√14)(3/√14), which equals 9/14. therefore, p(|+x>) is 9/14, or approximately 0.64.
</path>
<path>
2: the probability for the |-x> state is given by the squared magnitude of its coefficient. this coefficient is (-1 + 2i)/√14, so the squared magnitude is |(-1 + 2i)/√14|². the squared magnitude of the numerator (-1 + 2i) is computed as (-1)² + (2)², which equals 1 + 4 = 5. dividing by |√14|² = 14 yields 5/14. therefore, the probability p(|-x>) is 5/14.
</path>
<conclusion>
the probability of measuring the state |+x> is 9/14, and the probability of measuring the state |-x> is 5/14.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
so, the probabilities are 9/14 ≈ 0.6428 for |+x> and 5/14 ≈ 0.3571 for |-x>.
looking at the options, a) 0.54, 0.46; b) 0.64, 0.36; c) 0.28, 0.72; d) 0.61, 0.29.
so, 9/14 is exactly 0.642857..., which is approximately 0.64, and 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is closest to 0.36.
so, the probabilities would correspond to b) 0.64 and 0.36.
wait, but 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is 0.357, so rounding to two decimal places, 0.36.
so that's 0.64 and 0.36.
that's the first part.
the second part is to find the average value of the operator a.
the average value is <a> = <alpha| a |alpha>.
since a is hermitian, the average value should be a real number.
given that |alpha> is already expressed in terms of the eigenstates of a, we can use the expansion we just did.
the expectation value is the sum of the probabilities of each eigenstate multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues.
since the eigenvalues of a are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2 for |+x> and |-x>, respectively.
therefore, <a> = (probability of |+x>) * (ħ/2) + (probability of |-x>) * (-ħ/2)
let's think in parallel.

</path>
<path>
2: the probability for the |-x> state is given by the square of the absolute value of its coefficient. this coefficient is (-1 + 2i)/√14, so the squared magnitude is |(-1 + 2i)/√14|². the squared magnitude of the numerator (-1 + 2i) is computed as (-1)² + (2)², which equals 1 + 4 = 5. dividing by |√14|² = 14 yields 5/14. therefore, the probability p(|-x>) is 5/14.
</path>
<conclusion>
the probability of measuring the state |+x> is 9/14, and the probability of measuring the state |-x> is 5/14.

compute <a>:
let's think in parallel.

1: the term is calculated as (9/14) * (ħ/2), which equals (9ħ/28).
</path>
<path>
2: the second term is (5/14)*(-ħ/2), which simplifies to -5ħ/28.
</path>
<conclusion>
the first term for the expectation value <a> is (9ħ/28), and the second term is (-5ħ/28).
</conclusion>
</parallel>
therefore, <a> = (9ħ/28 -5ħ/28) = (4ħ/28) = ħ/7.
so the average value is ħ/7.
looking back at the options: a) 0.54, 0.46 and 3ħ/√7; b) 0.64, 0.36 and ħ/7; c) 0.28, 0.72 and ħ/√7; d) 0.61, 0.29 and 2ħ/√7.
the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.64 and 5/14≈0.36, so b) has those.
then the average is ħ/7, which is exactly the third option in b).
so the answer should be b.
wait, but just to confirm, let's do it another way.
alternatively, compute the expectation value using the original state and the operator a.
let's verify.
original state |alpha> is (1/√7)[(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>].
the operator a is (ħ/2)σ_x, whose matrix is [0, ħ/2; ħ/2, 0] in the |up>, |down> basis.
so, <a> = <alpha| a |alpha>.
first, write |alpha> as a vector: |alpha> = 1/√7 [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ].
so, in vector form: 1/√7 * [ (1+i), (2 - i) ]^t.
the bra <alpha| is the hermitian conjugate: 1/√7 [ (1 - i), (2 + i) ].
then, compute <alpha| a |alpha>.
matrix multiplication.
first, compute a |alpha>.
a is: [0, ħ/2; ħ/2, 0].
multiplying a with |alpha>: ħ/2 * [ (2 - i), (1 + i) ]^t, scaled by 1/√7.
wait, let's do it step by step.
compute a |alpha>:
row 1 of a is [0, ħ/2].
multiply with |alpha> vector: 0*(1+i)/√7 + ħ/2*(2 - i)/√7 = ħ/2*(2 - i)/√7.
row 2 of a is [ħ/2, 0].
multiply with |alpha>: ħ/2*(1 + i)/√7 + 0 = ħ/2*(1 + i)/√7.
therefore, a |alpha> = (ħ/2)/√7 [ (2 - i), (1 + i) ]^t.
now, take the inner product with <alpha|: which is 1/√7 [ (1 - i), (2 + i) ].
so: <alpha| a |alpha> = 1/√7 [ (1 - i), (2 + i) ] • (ħ/2)/√7 [ (2 - i), (1 + i) ]^t = (ħ/2)/7 [ (1 - i)(2 - i) + (2 + i)(1 + i) ]
compute the two terms:
first term: (1 - i)(2 - i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) -i*2 + (-i)*(-i) = 2 -i -2i + i^2 = 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.
second term: (2 + i)(1 + i) = 2*1 + 2*i +i*1 + i*i = 2 +2i +i +i^2 = 2 +3i -1 = 1 + 3i.
adding the two terms: (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) = 2.
therefore, <alpha| a |alpha> = (ħ/2)/7 * 2 = (ħ/2)*(2/7) = ħ/7.
so that's correct.
therefore, the average is ħ/7.
so the answer is b) 0.64, 0.36 and ħ/7.
wait, but let me check the probabilities once more.
the coefficients when we expressed |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x> were 3 and (-1 + 2i).
then the probabilities are |3/√14|^2 = 9/14 ≈0.642857 and |(-1 + 2i)/√14|^2 = (1^2 +2^2)/14 =5/14≈0.357.
so exactly 9/14 and 5/14, which sum to 14/14=1.
that's good.
so 9/14≈0.642857 which is 0.64 (option b lists 0.64 and 0.36; 0.36 is 5/14≈0.357).
since the options have to round somewhere, 0.357 can be written as 0.36.
so b is correct.
therefore, the answer is b.
**final answer**
\boxed{b}
</think>

answer: to solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle \propto (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). the normalization constant \( n \) is calculated as follows:

1. calculate the norm squared of the coefficients:
   - \( |1+i|^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2 \)
   - \( |2-i|^2 = 2^2 + (-1)^2 = 5 \)

2. the normalization constant \( n \) is \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \), leading to the normalized state:
   \[
   |\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right)
   \]

next, we express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of the eigenstates of the operator \( a \), which is proportional to the pauli matrix \( \sigma_x \). the eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \) are \( |+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle) \) and \( |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle) \).

substituting these into \( |\alpha\rangle \):
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+x\rangle + |-x\rangle) + (2-i)\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+x\rangle - |-x\rangle) \right)
\]

combining the terms:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left( 3|+x\rangle + (-1 + 2i)|-x\rangle \right)
\]

the probabilities are calculated by taking the squared magnitudes of the coefficients:
- probability of \( |+x\rangle \): \( \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64 \)
- probability of \( |-x\rangle \): \( \left| \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36 \)

for the average value of the operator \( a \), we use the expectation value:
\[
\langle a \rangle = \langle \alpha | a | \alpha \rangle
\]

using the eigenvalues \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \) and their probabilities:
\[
\langle a \rangle = \left( \frac{9}{14} \right) \frac{\hbar}{2} + \left( \frac{5}{14} \right) \left( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \right) = \frac{\hbar}{7}
\]

thus, the final answers are:
- probabilities: \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \)
- average value: \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \)

the correct choice is:
\boxed{b}
