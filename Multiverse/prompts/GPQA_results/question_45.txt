Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. We need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state in terms of E, where E is given as π2ħ2/2mL2.
First, since the particles are identical spin-1/2 particles, they are fermions. That means they have to obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. So, when arranging their wavefunctions, we need to make sure that each particle is in a unique quantum state.
Let's think in parallel.

1: The quantum numbers for the ground state are considered. The particles are spin-1/2 fermions, meaning each can occupy distinct quantum states.
The total number of particles is four.
Each quantum state is defined by a quantum number n and a spin state.
For identical fermions, the Pauli exclusion principle applies, requiring unique quantum states for each particle.
The one-dimensional infinite potential well is the context.
The energy levels for a single particle in this well are given by E_n = (n^2 * π2ħ2)/(2mL2).
The given energy E is defined as π2ħ2/(2mL2), so E_n = n2E.
For four particles, the total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of each individual particle, each in its lowest available state.
The Pauli exclusion principle dictates that each particle must occupy a unique quantum state.
The first particle occupies the n=1 state with spin up.
The second particle also occupies the n=1 state but with spin down, as the spin is different.
The third particle must occupy the next higher quantum number, n=2, with spin up.
The fourth particle occupies the n=2 state with spin down.
This configuration ensures all four particles are in allowed states with unique quantum numbers or spin.
The quantum numbers for the four particles are n=1 (spin up), n=1 (spin down), n=2 (spin up), and n=2 (spin down).
This is the arrangement for the ground state.
The total energy of the system is calculated by summing the individual energies.
The energy for n=1 is E, and for n=2 it is 4E.
The first two particles contribute E each, and the next two contribute 4E each.
The total energy is E + E + 4E + 4E = 10E.
This total energy of 10E corresponds to the ground state.
</Path>
<Path>
2: For the first excited state, the next available quantum number (n=2) is used for one of the particles. The first excited state involves one particle occupying the n=2 state. This results in two particles in the n=1 state and two in the n=2 state. The energy of the first excited state is calculated as 2*(1^2 + 2^2) * E = 2*5*E = 10E.
</Path>
<Path>
3: For the second excited state, the configuration is n1=1, n2=1, n3=2, n4=3, with each quantum number corresponding to a distinct particle, and all four particles having unique quantum numbers.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The quantum number configurations for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of four spin-1/2 fermions in a 1D infinite potential well are determined by the Pauli exclusion principle. The ground state involves two particles in the n=1 state (with opposite spins) and two in the n=2 state (also with opposite spins), yielding a total energy of 10E. The first excited state has two particles in the n=1 state and two in the n=2 state, also with opposite spins, resulting in a total energy of 10E. The second excited state configuration consists of two particles in the n=1 state, one particle in the n=2 state, and one particle in the n=3 state, all with unique quantum numbers or spin states, leading to a total energy of 18E.

Wait, but in this case, since all four particles are fermions, each energy level can hold two particles with opposite spins. So for the n=1 state, you can have two particles (spin up and spin down). Similarly, for n=2, you can have two particles. So the ground state would have both n=1 and n=2 states filled with two particles each. But wait, that would give us a total energy of 2*(12 + 22)E = 2*(1 + 4)E = 10E.
Then the first excited state would be when one particle is promoted to the next higher state, which is n=3. Because n=2 is already filled. Wait, but wait, no. If we have four particles, in the ground state, the first two energy levels (n=1 and n=2) are each occupied by two particles. So the next available state would be n=3.
Wait, but in that case, for the first excited state, we replace one particle from the n=2 state with one in the n=3 state. Wait, but how does that work with identical particles? Let's think carefully.
Wait, actually, for indistinguishable particles, the concept is that you fill the energy levels up to a certain point. So the ground state would have the lowest total energy, which is two particles in n=1 and two in n=2. Wait, but actually, wait a second. Wait, in the infinite potential well, each quantum number n corresponds to a single state, but with two possible spin states (up and down). So for each n, you can have two fermions. Therefore, the n=1 state can hold two particles (spin up and down), n=2 can hold two particles (spin up and down), etc.
Wait, but spin-1/2 particles in one dimension... but in one dimension, the orbital part of the wavefunction doesn't have a degeneracy. So each n is unique. Then with spin, each n can accommodate two particles. Therefore, the first two energy levels (n=1 and n=2) would each have two particles. So the ground state is n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles). That gives the total energy as 2*(12 + 22)E = 10E.
Then the first excited state would be when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3. But wait, that would leave a "hole" in n=2, but since particles are indistinguishable, the actual excitation would be that the next highest energy state. Wait, but if all particles are fermions, then the next available state after n=2 (with both spin up and down occupied) would be n=3, spin up. So in the first excited state, we would have two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2 (spin up), and one particle in n=3 (spin up). Wait, but how does that work? Wait, no, actually, wait. Let's clarify.
Wait, in the ground state, all particles are in the lowest available energy states. So since each n can hold two particles (spin up and down), the ground state would be n=1 with two particles (spin up and down), and n=2 with two particles (spin up and down). That's four particles. Then, the first excited state would be when one particle is moved from n=2 (spin down) to n=3 (spin up). Wait, but how does that work? Because in the ground state, n=1 has both spin states filled, and n=2 has both spin states filled. So to excite, we need to move a particle to a higher n with an available spin state. But in n=3, both spin states are available because no particles are there yet. So the first excited state would be: n=1 with both spins up and down (two particles), n=2 with spin up, and n=3 with spin up. Wait, but that would mean the total energy is E_n=1*2 + E_n=2 + E_n=3 = 12E + 22E + 32E = (1 + 4 + 9)E = 14E. But none of the options have 14E. Hmm, maybe my approach is wrong.
Wait, let's check the problem again. The problem says four identical spin-1/2 particles in a 1D infinite potential well. The energies are given as E = π2ħ2/2mL2, so each energy level is n2E.
Wait, but maybe for multiple particles, the total energy is the sum of each individual particle's energy. Since they are fermions, they have to occupy different single-particle states. Wait, but since each n can have two particles with spin up and down.
Wait, perhaps for four particles, in the ground state, the two lowest n states are completely filled. So n=1 has two particles (spin up and down), and n=2 has two particles (spin up and down). Then, the ground state energy is 2*(12 + 22)E = 10E.
Then, the first excited state would be when one particle is promoted from n=2 (spin down) to n=3 (spin up). So the states would be n=1 (both spin up and down), n=2 (only spin up), n=3 (spin up), and n=2 (spin down) is empty? Wait, but that would leave unpaired, but since they are indistinguishable, perhaps the excitation is moving one particle from n=2 to n=3. Then the total energy would be n=1 (2E) + n=2 (4E) + n=3 (9E). But that would be 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E? Wait, but that's for three particles. Wait, no. Wait, if we have four particles, then in the first excited state, we need to have three particles in n=1 and n=2, and one in n=3? Wait, no. Wait, maybe not.
Wait, maybe the correct approach is that in the ground state, all four particles are in the lowest possible energy levels, obeying the Pauli exclusion principle. Since each n can have two particles (spin up/down). So n=1 can take two, n=2 can take two. So ground state is n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles). Energy is 2*(12 + 22)E = 10E.
Then the first excited state: To get the first excited state, we need to promote one particle to the next available highest state, which is n=3. So replace one particle in n=2 with one in n=3. But since each n=1 and n=2 in the ground state has two particles each. To replace one particle from n=2 (which has two particles) to n=3, which can take one particle (since spin must be different). Wait, no: in n=3, both spin states are available. Since the original n=2 had two particles (spin up and down), removing one (say, spin down) and putting a particle in n=3 spin down. So the first excited state would have: n=1 with two particles (spin up and down), n=2 with one particle (spin up), n=3 with one particle (spin down). Then the total energy would be E_n=1*2 (since n=1 is full) + E_n=2*1 + E_n=3*1. But wait, no. Wait, energy is per particle. So each particle contributes their own energy. So total energy is (12 + 12 + 22 + 32)E? Wait, but if two particles are in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3, then total energy is 2*12E + 1*22E + 1*32E = 2*1*E + 4E + 9E = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E. So that would be the first excited state.
Wait, but in that case, let's check the degeneracy. But the problem is asking for the energy, not the degeneracy. So the first excited state would be 15E. Then the second excited state would be when another particle is promoted. For example, moving another particle from n=2 to n=3. Wait, but there's only one particle left in n=2. Wait, if we move that one as well, then we'd have n=1 with two particles, n=3 with two particles. But that would require moving both particles from n=2 to n=3, but that would be a higher excitation.
Alternatively, maybe another configuration. Alternatively, if we leave n=2 with one particle and add a particle to n=4. So total energy would be 2*12E + 22E + 32E + 42E = 2E + 4E + 9E + 16E = 31E. But that might be higher. Alternatively, moving one more particle from n=2 to n=3. Wait, but n=2 only has one particle left. So moving that would result in n=1 and n=3 each with two particles. That would be total energy 2*12E + 2*32E = 2*1*E + 2*9*E = 2E + 18E = 20E. But 20E is higher than 15E. Alternatively, moving a particle from n=1 to n=3. But that would actually increase the energy more. Because replacing a particle from n=1 to n=3 would mean subtract 1E and add 9E, so net increase of 8E. Whereas leaving n=1 as is and promoting from n=2 to n=3 only adds 9E - 4E = 5E. So the lower energy excitation is moving from n=2 to n=3.
But perhaps another way: Maybe splitting the particles in n=2. Wait, but no. Let's see. The first excited state is 15E. Then the second excited state would be the next higher energy. To get that, we could promote another particle from n=2 to n=3. So then we have two particles in n=3. So total energy is 2*12E + 0*22E + 2*32E = 2E + 18E = 20E. But is that the next? Or is there an excited state with lower energy? Alternatively, promoting one particle from n=1 to n=3. Let's calculate that. If we take one particle from n=1 (energy 1E) and put it into n=3 (energy 9E), the net increase is 8E. So the total energy would be original ground state 10E + 8E = 18E. So 18E. That's lower than 20E. So 18E would be the second excited state. But let's confirm.
So the ground state is 10E. The first excited state is 15E (promote one particle from n=2 to n=3). The second excited state could be 18E (promote one particle from n=1 to n=3). But is that allowed? Let's check the configuration.
Ground state: n=1 (2 particles), spin up/down), n=2 (2 particles, spin up/down). First excited state: n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). Energy 2*1 + 1*2 + 1*3 = 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. Then multiply by E? Wait, no, n squared. So (12*2 + 22*1 + 32*1)E = (2 + 4 + 9)E = 15E.
Second excited state: Option 1, move another particle from n=2 to n=3. Then n=2 has none, n=3 has two. Energy: 2*1 + 2*9 = 2 + 18 = 20E. Option 2, move a particle from n=1 to n=3. Then n=1 has one particle, n=2 remains as is? Wait, no. If moving one from n=1 to n=3, we have n=1 with one particle, n=2 with two particles, n=3 with one particle. But wait, n=1 can hold two. So that configuration would be allowed. But in terms of energy, that would be 12*1 + 22*2 + 32*1 = 1 + 8 + 9 = 18E. So 18E is lower than 20E, so the second excited state would be 18E. Then the third excited state would be 20E.
But the options given are A) 30E, 39E, 50E; B) 4E, 10E, 15E; C) 10E, 15E, 18E; D) 4E, 10E, 50E. So if ground state is 10E, first excited is 15E, and second excited is 18E, that would be option C. But wait, wait a minute. But let's check again.
Wait, perhaps the particles are arranged in the well, each in an energy level. For four particles, in the ground state, the highest occupied energy level is the smallest such that all levels up to it are filled. Since each level can hold two particles. So n=1 holds two, n=2 holds two. So total of four. Therefore, the ground state is n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles), energy 2*(12 + 22)E = 10E. Then the first excited state would be when one particle is in n=3. So the configuration is n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). So energy is 2*12 + 1*22 + 1*32 = 2 + 4 + 9 = 15E. Then the second excited state could be n=1 (1), n=2 (1), n=3 (2). So energy is 1*12 + 1*22 + 2*32 = 1 + 4 + 18 = 23E. But 23E is not in the options. Wait, but earlier we thought promoting another particle from n=2 to n=3 gives 20E, and from n=1 to n=3 gives 18E. Wait, but maybe my calculation was wrong.
Wait, let's do it step by step. Original ground state: 2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2. Energy 10E. First excited state: Remove a particle from n=2 (energy 4E per particle) and place it in n=3 (energy 9E). The total energy increase is 9E - 4E = 5E, so new total energy is 10E + 5E = 15E. Correct. Second excited state: Now we have three particles in n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). To get the next excited state, we can remove another particle from n=2 (if possible) to n=3. But n=2 only has one particle left. Moving that gives energy increase of 9E - 4E = 5E. But 15E +5E=20E. But 20E is not in the options. Alternatively, moving a particle from n=1 (energy 1E per particle) to n=3 (energy 9E). That would increase energy by 9E -1E=8E per moved particle. So 15E +8E=23E, which is also not in the options. Alternatively, moving a particle from n=1 to n=4. That would be 16E -1E=15E increase, leading to 15E +15E=30E. That's even higher. Wait, but option C has 10E, 15E, 18E. So where does 18E come from?
Wait, perhaps instead of promoting a particle from n=2 to n=3, maybe we promote one from n=1 to n=2 and another from n=2 to n=3? Wait, but that would not make sense because we need to maintain the Pauli exclusion. Alternatively, arranging the particles in different states. Wait, maybe filling n=1 with two particles, n=2 with one particle, and n=3 with one particle. Then, for the next excitation, fill n=4. But that would lead to higher energies.
Alternatively, maybe I need to consider all four particles' energies each time. Wait, let's think differently. For four particles in a 1D box, each with energy n2E. They are fermions, so they obey the Pauli exclusion principle, meaning each single-particle state can be occupied by at most one particle. Wait, but spin-1/2 particles can have two particles per energy level (different spins). Wait, this is where I might be getting confused. In the case of non-interacting fermions in a 1D box, each energy level n can have two particles with opposite spins. Therefore, the ground state would be the lowest energy configuration where each particle is in a different single-particle state (including spin). So the first two particles go into n=1 with spin up and down. The next two particles go into n=2 with spin up and down. Thus, the total energy is 2*(12 + 22)E = 10E. For the first excited state, the next available state is n=3 with spin up. So we need to move one particle from n=2 (spin down) to n=3 (spin up). Therefore, the energy becomes (2*12E) + (1*22E) + (1*32E) = 2E +4E +9E =15E. For the second excited state, we can move another particle from n=2 (if any left) to n=3. But in this case, n=2 only had one particle left after the first excitation. If we move that one as well, then we have n=3 with two particles (spin up and down), but that would require two excitations. Alternatively, moving a particle from n=1 to n=3. However, n=1 now has two particles. Since the states are filled, to move a particle from n=1 (spin down) to n=3 (spin down), but n=3 already has a particle with spin up. So adding a spin down would give n=3 with two particles. The energy would be (1*12E) + (0*22E) + (2*32E) =1E + 0 + 18E =19E. But that's not in the options. Alternatively, split the particles in n=1. Move one from n=1 and one from n=2 to higher levels. Wait, but that might result in even higher energy.
Alternatively, if the second excitation is moving a particle from n=1 to n=4. Energy increase: 16E -1E=15E, leading to 15E +15E=30E. Hmm, which again isn't an option.
Wait, but the options given are C) 10E, 15E, 18E. So 10,15,18. How can we get 18? Let's see. If in the first excited state, we have one particle in n=3. Then in the second excited state, perhaps move another particle to n=4. So total energy would be 2*1E + 1*2E +1*3E +1*4E =2+2+3+4=11, multiplied by E? Wait, no. Wait, energies are n2E. So (12*2 + 22*1 +32*1 +42*1)E = (2+4+9+16)E=31E. Not helpful.
Alternatively, maybe miscounting somewhere. Wait, perhaps the particles are arranged in different energy levels. For example, two particles in n=1 (2E), one in n=2 (4E), and one in n=3 (9E) totals 15E. For the next state, perhaps two particles in n=1, and two in n=3. That would be 2*1 + 2*9 = 20E. Alternatively, one particle in n=1, one in n=2, and two in n=3. That would be 1*1 +1*4 +2*9=1+4+18=23E. Still no 18E. Wait, unless there is a different configuration. Wait, perhaps three particles in n=2 and one in n=1. But n=2 can only hold two particles. So that's not possible. Alternatively, two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3 as before.
Wait, maybe there's a miscalculation here. Let's check the options again. Option C is 10E, 15E, 18E. So if the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, then the second excited should be 18E. How?
Wait, let's imagine that in the first excited state, there's a particle in n=3. To get to the second excited state, perhaps move a particle from n=1 to n=4. So energy would be: original 15E (from 2 in n=1,1 in n=2,1 in n=3). If moving a particle from n=1 (energy 1E) to n=4 (energy 16E), the total energy becomes 15E -1E +16E =30E. Not helpful.
Alternatively, moving a particle from n=2 to n=4. So replacing the n=2 particle (4E) with an n=4 particle (16E). Total energy becomes 15E -4E +16E =27E. Not 18E.
Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's think differently. The problem gives E as π2ħ2/(2mL2), so each energy level is n2E. The answer options suggest 10E, 15E, 18E. Let's see if these numbers can be expressed as sums of squares. 10E = 2*12 + 2*22)E → 2*1 + 2*4 =2+8=10. 15E = 2*12 +1*22 +1*32)E → 2*1 +1*4 +1*9=2+4+9=15. 18E = 1*12 + 2*22 +1*32)E? 1*1 + 2*4 +1*9=1+8+9=18. Wait, yes. So that would correspond to one particle in n=1, two particles in n=2, and one particle in n=3. But how is that allowed? Since n=1 can hold two, n=2 can hold two, etc. But if we have one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3, that would indeed sum to 18E. But how does that configuration arise? Let's see. Starting from the ground state (two in n=1, two in n=2). To get to 1*12 +2*22 +1*32, we need to move one particle from n=1 to n=3. So moving a particle from n=1 (1E) to n=3 (9E) would increase the energy by 9E -1E=8E. So 10E +8E=18E. Yes, that works. So the second excited state is 18E. Then why isn't this in the options? Wait, check option C: 10E, 15E, 18E. Yes, that's exactly option C. So the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E. Therefore, the answer should be C.
But let me confirm again. The problem might be considering a different ordering. Sometimes, the excited states could consider promoting two particles at once, but that would generally give higher energies. Also, moving particles to higher n's. But according to the rules of quantum mechanics, the first few excited states would indeed be promoting particles one at a time to the lowest available higher states. So moving from n=2 to n=3 gives 15E, moving from n=1 to n=3 gives 18E, and moving another particle from n=2 to n=3 gives 20E. So 15E and 18E are the first two excited states after 10E. Therefore, option C is correct.
Alternatively, if there's a mistake in considering the spin states, but since each n can hold two particles with opposite spins, the configurations we considered are valid. So I think option C is correct.
</Think>

Answer: To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we consider the Pauli exclusion principle. Each energy level \( n \) can hold two particles with opposite spins.

1. **Ground State**:
   - The lowest energy levels are filled first. The particles occupy \( n=1 \) (two particles) and \( n=2 \) (two particles).
   - Total energy: \( 2 \times (1^2 + 2^2)E = 2 \times (1 + 4)E = 10E \).

2. **First Excited State**:
   - One particle is promoted from \( n=2 \) to \( n=3 \). The configuration becomes \( n=1 \) (two particles), \( n=2 \) (one particle), and \( n=3 \) (one particle).
   - Total energy: \( 2 \times 1^2E + 1 \times 2^2E + 1 \times 3^2E = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E \).

3. **Second Excited State**:
   - One particle is promoted from \( n=1 \) to \( n=3 \). The configuration becomes \( n=1 \) (one particle), \( n=2 \) (two particles), and \( n=3 \) (one particle).
   - Total energy: \( 1 \times 1^2E + 2 \times 2^2E + 1 \times 3^2E = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E \).

The energies are thus determined to be 10E (ground state), 15E (first excited state), and 18E (second excited state).

okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. so, the question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. we need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state in terms of e, where e is given as π2ħ2/2ml2.
first, since the particles are identical spin-1/2 particles, they are fermions. that means they have to obey the pauli exclusion principle, which states that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. so, when arranging their wavefunctions, we need to make sure that each particle is in a unique quantum state.
let's think in parallel.

1: the quantum numbers for the ground state are considered. the particles are spin-1/2 fermions, meaning each can occupy distinct quantum states.
the total number of particles is four.
each quantum state is defined by a quantum number n and a spin state.
for identical fermions, the pauli exclusion principle applies, requiring unique quantum states for each particle.
the one-dimensional infinite potential well is the context.
the energy levels for a single particle in this well are given by e_n = (n^2 * π2ħ2)/(2ml2).
the given energy e is defined as π2ħ2/(2ml2), so e_n = n2e.
for four particles, the total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of each individual particle, each in its lowest available state.
the pauli exclusion principle dictates that each particle must occupy a unique quantum state.
the first particle occupies the n=1 state with spin up.
the second particle also occupies the n=1 state but with spin down, as the spin is different.
the third particle must occupy the next higher quantum number, n=2, with spin up.
the fourth particle occupies the n=2 state with spin down.
this configuration ensures all four particles are in allowed states with unique quantum numbers or spin.
the quantum numbers for the four particles are n=1 (spin up), n=1 (spin down), n=2 (spin up), and n=2 (spin down).
this is the arrangement for the ground state.
the total energy of the system is calculated by summing the individual energies.
the energy for n=1 is e, and for n=2 it is 4e.
the first two particles contribute e each, and the next two contribute 4e each.
the total energy is e + e + 4e + 4e = 10e.
this total energy of 10e corresponds to the ground state.
</path>
<path>
2: for the first excited state, the next available quantum number (n=2) is used for one of the particles. the first excited state involves one particle occupying the n=2 state. this results in two particles in the n=1 state and two in the n=2 state. the energy of the first excited state is calculated as 2*(1^2 + 2^2) * e = 2*5*e = 10e.
</path>

3: for the second excited state, the configuration is n1=1, n2=1, n3=2, n4=3, with each quantum number corresponding to a distinct particle, and all four particles having unique quantum numbers.
</path>
<conclusion>
the quantum number configurations for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of four spin-1/2 fermions in a 1d infinite potential well are determined by the pauli exclusion principle. the ground state involves two particles in the n=1 state (with opposite spins) and two in the n=2 state (also with opposite spins), yielding a total energy of 10e. the first excited state has two particles in the n=1 state and two in the n=2 state, also with opposite spins, resulting in a total energy of 10e. the second excited state configuration consists of two particles in the n=1 state, one particle in the n=2 state, and one particle in the n=3 state, all with unique quantum numbers or spin states, leading to a total energy of 18e.

wait, but in this case, since all four particles are fermions, each energy level can hold two particles with opposite spins. so for the n=1 state, you can have two particles (spin up and spin down). similarly, for n=2, you can have two particles. so the ground state would have both n=1 and n=2 states filled with two particles each. but wait, that would give us a total energy of 2*(12 + 22)e = 2*(1 + 4)e = 10e.
then the first excited state would be when one particle is promoted to the next higher state, which is n=3. because n=2 is already filled. wait, but wait, no. if we have four particles, in the ground state, the first two energy levels (n=1 and n=2) are each occupied by two particles. so the next available state would be n=3.
wait, but in that case, for the first excited state, we replace one particle from the n=2 state with one in the n=3 state. wait, but how does that work with identical particles? let's think carefully.
wait, actually, for indistinguishable particles, the concept is that you fill the energy levels up to a certain point. so the ground state would have the lowest total energy, which is two particles in n=1 and two in n=2. wait, but actually, wait a second. wait, in the infinite potential well, each quantum number n corresponds to a single state, but with two possible spin states (up and down). so for each n, you can have two fermions. therefore, the n=1 state can hold two particles (spin up and down), n=2 can hold two particles (spin up and down), etc.
wait, but spin-1/2 particles in one dimension... but in one dimension, the orbital part of the wavefunction doesn't have a degeneracy. so each n is unique. then with spin, each n can accommodate two particles. therefore, the first two energy levels (n=1 and n=2) would each have two particles. so the ground state is n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles). that gives the total energy as 2*(12 + 22)e = 10e.
then the first excited state would be when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3. but wait, that would leave a "hole" in n=2, but since particles are indistinguishable, the actual excitation would be that the next highest energy state. wait, but if all particles are fermions, then the next available state after n=2 (with both spin up and down occupied) would be n=3, spin up. so in the first excited state, we would have two particles in n=1, one particle in n=2 (spin up), and one particle in n=3 (spin up). wait, but how does that work? wait, no, actually, wait. let's clarify.
wait, in the ground state, all particles are in the lowest available energy states. so since each n can hold two particles (spin up and down), the ground state would be n=1 with two particles (spin up and down), and n=2 with two particles (spin up and down). that's four particles. then, the first excited state would be when one particle is moved from n=2 (spin down) to n=3 (spin up). wait, but how does that work? because in the ground state, n=1 has both spin states filled, and n=2 has both spin states filled. so to excite, we need to move a particle to a higher n with an available spin state. but in n=3, both spin states are available because no particles are there yet. so the first excited state would be: n=1 with both spins up and down (two particles), n=2 with spin up, and n=3 with spin up. wait, but that would mean the total energy is e_n=1*2 + e_n=2 + e_n=3 = 12e + 22e + 32e = (1 + 4 + 9)e = 14e. but none of the options have 14e. hmm, maybe my approach is wrong.
wait, let's check the problem again. the problem says four identical spin-1/2 particles in a 1d infinite potential well. the energies are given as e = π2ħ2/2ml2, so each energy level is n2e.
wait, but maybe for multiple particles, the total energy is the sum of each individual particle's energy. since they are fermions, they have to occupy different single-particle states. wait, but since each n can have two particles with spin up and down.
wait, perhaps for four particles, in the ground state, the two lowest n states are completely filled. so n=1 has two particles (spin up and down), and n=2 has two particles (spin up and down). then, the ground state energy is 2*(12 + 22)e = 10e.
then, the first excited state would be when one particle is promoted from n=2 (spin down) to n=3 (spin up). so the states would be n=1 (both spin up and down), n=2 (only spin up), n=3 (spin up), and n=2 (spin down) is empty? wait, but that would leave unpaired, but since they are indistinguishable, perhaps the excitation is moving one particle from n=2 to n=3. then the total energy would be n=1 (2e) + n=2 (4e) + n=3 (9e). but that would be 2e + 4e + 9e = 15e? wait, but that's for three particles. wait, no. wait, if we have four particles, then in the first excited state, we need to have three particles in n=1 and n=2, and one in n=3? wait, no. wait, maybe not.
wait, maybe the correct approach is that in the ground state, all four particles are in the lowest possible energy levels, obeying the pauli exclusion principle. since each n can have two particles (spin up/down). so n=1 can take two, n=2 can take two. so ground state is n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles). energy is 2*(12 + 22)e = 10e.
then the first excited state: to get the first excited state, we need to promote one particle to the next available highest state, which is n=3. so replace one particle in n=2 with one in n=3. but since each n=1 and n=2 in the ground state has two particles each. to replace one particle from n=2 (which has two particles) to n=3, which can take one particle (since spin must be different). wait, no: in n=3, both spin states are available. since the original n=2 had two particles (spin up and down), removing one (say, spin down) and putting a particle in n=3 spin down. so the first excited state would have: n=1 with two particles (spin up and down), n=2 with one particle (spin up), n=3 with one particle (spin down). then the total energy would be e_n=1*2 (since n=1 is full) + e_n=2*1 + e_n=3*1. but wait, no. wait, energy is per particle. so each particle contributes their own energy. so total energy is (12 + 12 + 22 + 32)e? wait, but if two particles are in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3, then total energy is 2*12e + 1*22e + 1*32e = 2*1*e + 4e + 9e = 2e + 4e + 9e = 15e. so that would be the first excited state.
wait, but in that case, let's check the degeneracy. but the problem is asking for the energy, not the degeneracy. so the first excited state would be 15e. then the second excited state would be when another particle is promoted. for example, moving another particle from n=2 to n=3. wait, but there's only one particle left in n=2. wait, if we move that one as well, then we'd have n=1 with two particles, n=3 with two particles. but that would require moving both particles from n=2 to n=3, but that would be a higher excitation.
alternatively, maybe another configuration. alternatively, if we leave n=2 with one particle and add a particle to n=4. so total energy would be 2*12e + 22e + 32e + 42e = 2e + 4e + 9e + 16e = 31e. but that might be higher. alternatively, moving one more particle from n=2 to n=3. wait, but n=2 only has one particle left. so moving that would result in n=1 and n=3 each with two particles. that would be total energy 2*12e + 2*32e = 2*1*e + 2*9*e = 2e + 18e = 20e. but 20e is higher than 15e. alternatively, moving a particle from n=1 to n=3. but that would actually increase the energy more. because replacing a particle from n=1 to n=3 would mean subtract 1e and add 9e, so net increase of 8e. whereas leaving n=1 as is and promoting from n=2 to n=3 only adds 9e - 4e = 5e. so the lower energy excitation is moving from n=2 to n=3.
but perhaps another way: maybe splitting the particles in n=2. wait, but no. let's see. the first excited state is 15e. then the second excited state would be the next higher energy. to get that, we could promote another particle from n=2 to n=3. so then we have two particles in n=3. so total energy is 2*12e + 0*22e + 2*32e = 2e + 18e = 20e. but is that the next? or is there an excited state with lower energy? alternatively, promoting one particle from n=1 to n=3. let's calculate that. if we take one particle from n=1 (energy 1e) and put it into n=3 (energy 9e), the net increase is 8e. so the total energy would be original ground state 10e + 8e = 18e. so 18e. that's lower than 20e. so 18e would be the second excited state. but let's confirm.
so the ground state is 10e. the first excited state is 15e (promote one particle from n=2 to n=3). the second excited state could be 18e (promote one particle from n=1 to n=3). but is that allowed? let's check the configuration.
ground state: n=1 (2 particles), spin up/down), n=2 (2 particles, spin up/down). first excited state: n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). energy 2*1 + 1*2 + 1*3 = 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. then multiply by e? wait, no, n squared. so (12*2 + 22*1 + 32*1)e = (2 + 4 + 9)e = 15e.
second excited state: option 1, move another particle from n=2 to n=3. then n=2 has none, n=3 has two. energy: 2*1 + 2*9 = 2 + 18 = 20e. option 2, move a particle from n=1 to n=3. then n=1 has one particle, n=2 remains as is? wait, no. if moving one from n=1 to n=3, we have n=1 with one particle, n=2 with two particles, n=3 with one particle. but wait, n=1 can hold two. so that configuration would be allowed. but in terms of energy, that would be 12*1 + 22*2 + 32*1 = 1 + 8 + 9 = 18e. so 18e is lower than 20e, so the second excited state would be 18e. then the third excited state would be 20e.
but the options given are a) 30e, 39e, 50e; b) 4e, 10e, 15e; c) 10e, 15e, 18e; d) 4e, 10e, 50e. so if ground state is 10e, first excited is 15e, and second excited is 18e, that would be option c. but wait, wait a minute. but let's check again.
wait, perhaps the particles are arranged in the well, each in an energy level. for four particles, in the ground state, the highest occupied energy level is the smallest such that all levels up to it are filled. since each level can hold two particles. so n=1 holds two, n=2 holds two. so total of four. therefore, the ground state is n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles), energy 2*(12 + 22)e = 10e. then the first excited state would be when one particle is in n=3. so the configuration is n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). so energy is 2*12 + 1*22 + 1*32 = 2 + 4 + 9 = 15e. then the second excited state could be n=1 (1), n=2 (1), n=3 (2). so energy is 1*12 + 1*22 + 2*32 = 1 + 4 + 18 = 23e. but 23e is not in the options. wait, but earlier we thought promoting another particle from n=2 to n=3 gives 20e, and from n=1 to n=3 gives 18e. wait, but maybe my calculation was wrong.
wait, let's do it step by step. original ground state: 2 particles in n=1, 2 in n=2. energy 10e. first excited state: remove a particle from n=2 (energy 4e per particle) and place it in n=3 (energy 9e). the total energy increase is 9e - 4e = 5e, so new total energy is 10e + 5e = 15e. correct. second excited state: now we have three particles in n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). to get the next excited state, we can remove another particle from n=2 (if possible) to n=3. but n=2 only has one particle left. moving that gives energy increase of 9e - 4e = 5e. but 15e +5e=20e. but 20e is not in the options. alternatively, moving a particle from n=1 (energy 1e per particle) to n=3 (energy 9e). that would increase energy by 9e -1e=8e per moved particle. so 15e +8e=23e, which is also not in the options. alternatively, moving a particle from n=1 to n=4. that would be 16e -1e=15e increase, leading to 15e +15e=30e. that's even higher. wait, but option c has 10e, 15e, 18e. so where does 18e come from?
wait, perhaps instead of promoting a particle from n=2 to n=3, maybe we promote one from n=1 to n=2 and another from n=2 to n=3? wait, but that would not make sense because we need to maintain the pauli exclusion. alternatively, arranging the particles in different states. wait, maybe filling n=1 with two particles, n=2 with one particle, and n=3 with one particle. then, for the next excitation, fill n=4. but that would lead to higher energies.
alternatively, maybe i need to consider all four particles' energies each time. wait, let's think differently. for four particles in a 1d box, each with energy n2e. they are fermions, so they obey the pauli exclusion principle, meaning each single-particle state can be occupied by at most one particle. wait, but spin-1/2 particles can have two particles per energy level (different spins). wait, this is where i might be getting confused. in the case of non-interacting fermions in a 1d box, each energy level n can have two particles with opposite spins. therefore, the ground state would be the lowest energy configuration where each particle is in a different single-particle state (including spin). so the first two particles go into n=1 with spin up and down. the next two particles go into n=2 with spin up and down. thus, the total energy is 2*(12 + 22)e = 10e. for the first excited state, the next available state is n=3 with spin up. so we need to move one particle from n=2 (spin down) to n=3 (spin up). therefore, the energy becomes (2*12e) + (1*22e) + (1*32e) = 2e +4e +9e =15e. for the second excited state, we can move another particle from n=2 (if any left) to n=3. but in this case, n=2 only had one particle left after the first excitation. if we move that one as well, then we have n=3 with two particles (spin up and down), but that would require two excitations. alternatively, moving a particle from n=1 to n=3. however, n=1 now has two particles. since the states are filled, to move a particle from n=1 (spin down) to n=3 (spin down), but n=3 already has a particle with spin up. so adding a spin down would give n=3 with two particles. the energy would be (1*12e) + (0*22e) + (2*32e) =1e + 0 + 18e =19e. but that's not in the options. alternatively, split the particles in n=1. move one from n=1 and one from n=2 to higher levels. wait, but that might result in even higher energy.
alternatively, if the second excitation is moving a particle from n=1 to n=4. energy increase: 16e -1e=15e, leading to 15e +15e=30e. hmm, which again isn't an option.
wait, but the options given are c) 10e, 15e, 18e. so 10,15,18. how can we get 18? let's see. if in the first excited state, we have one particle in n=3. then in the second excited state, perhaps move another particle to n=4. so total energy would be 2*1e + 1*2e +1*3e +1*4e =2+2+3+4=11, multiplied by e? wait, no. wait, energies are n2e. so (12*2 + 22*1 +32*1 +42*1)e = (2+4+9+16)e=31e. not helpful.
alternatively, maybe miscounting somewhere. wait, perhaps the particles are arranged in different energy levels. for example, two particles in n=1 (2e), one in n=2 (4e), and one in n=3 (9e) totals 15e. for the next state, perhaps two particles in n=1, and two in n=3. that would be 2*1 + 2*9 = 20e. alternatively, one particle in n=1, one in n=2, and two in n=3. that would be 1*1 +1*4 +2*9=1+4+18=23e. still no 18e. wait, unless there is a different configuration. wait, perhaps three particles in n=2 and one in n=1. but n=2 can only hold two particles. so that's not possible. alternatively, two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3 as before.
wait, maybe there's a miscalculation here. let's check the options again. option c is 10e, 15e, 18e. so if the ground state is 10e, first excited 15e, then the second excited should be 18e. how?
wait, let's imagine that in the first excited state, there's a particle in n=3. to get to the second excited state, perhaps move a particle from n=1 to n=4. so energy would be: original 15e (from 2 in n=1,1 in n=2,1 in n=3). if moving a particle from n=1 (energy 1e) to n=4 (energy 16e), the total energy becomes 15e -1e +16e =30e. not helpful.
alternatively, moving a particle from n=2 to n=4. so replacing the n=2 particle (4e) with an n=4 particle (16e). total energy becomes 15e -4e +16e =27e. not 18e.
wait, maybe i'm missing something. let's think differently. the problem gives e as π2ħ2/(2ml2), so each energy level is n2e. the answer options suggest 10e, 15e, 18e. let's see if these numbers can be expressed as sums of squares. 10e = 2*12 + 2*22)e → 2*1 + 2*4 =2+8=10. 15e = 2*12 +1*22 +1*32)e → 2*1 +1*4 +1*9=2+4+9=15. 18e = 1*12 + 2*22 +1*32)e? 1*1 + 2*4 +1*9=1+8+9=18. wait, yes. so that would correspond to one particle in n=1, two particles in n=2, and one particle in n=3. but how is that allowed? since n=1 can hold two, n=2 can hold two, etc. but if we have one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3, that would indeed sum to 18e. but how does that configuration arise? let's see. starting from the ground state (two in n=1, two in n=2). to get to 1*12 +2*22 +1*32, we need to move one particle from n=1 to n=3. so moving a particle from n=1 (1e) to n=3 (9e) would increase the energy by 9e -1e=8e. so 10e +8e=18e. yes, that works. so the second excited state is 18e. then why isn't this in the options? wait, check option c: 10e, 15e, 18e. yes, that's exactly option c. so the ground state is 10e, first excited 15e, second excited 18e. therefore, the answer should be c.
but let me confirm again. the problem might be considering a different ordering. sometimes, the excited states could consider promoting two particles at once, but that would generally give higher energies. also, moving particles to higher n's. but according to the rules of quantum mechanics, the first few excited states would indeed be promoting particles one at a time to the lowest available higher states. so moving from n=2 to n=3 gives 15e, moving from n=1 to n=3 gives 18e, and moving another particle from n=2 to n=3 gives 20e. so 15e and 18e are the first two excited states after 10e. therefore, option c is correct.
alternatively, if there's a mistake in considering the spin states, but since each n can hold two particles with opposite spins, the configurations we considered are valid. so i think option c is correct.

answer: to determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we consider the pauli exclusion principle. each energy level \( n \) can hold two particles with opposite spins.

1. **ground state**:
   - the lowest energy levels are filled first. the particles occupy \( n=1 \) (two particles) and \( n=2 \) (two particles).
   - total energy: \( 2 \times (1^2 + 2^2)e = 2 \times (1 + 4)e = 10e \).

2. **first excited state**:
   - one particle is promoted from \( n=2 \) to \( n=3 \). the configuration becomes \( n=1 \) (two particles), \( n=2 \) (one particle), and \( n=3 \) (one particle).
   - total energy: \( 2 \times 1^2e + 1 \times 2^2e + 1 \times 3^2e = 2e + 4e + 9e = 15e \).

3. **second excited state**:
   - one particle is promoted from \( n=1 \) to \( n=3 \). the configuration becomes \( n=1 \) (one particle), \( n=2 \) (two particles), and \( n=3 \) (one particle).
   - total energy: \( 1 \times 1^2e + 2 \times 2^2e + 1 \times 3^2e = 1e + 8e + 9e = 18e \).

the energies are thus determined to be 10e (ground state), 15e (first excited state), and 18e (second excited state).

\boxed{c}
