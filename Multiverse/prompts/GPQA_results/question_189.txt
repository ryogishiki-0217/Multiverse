Okay, so I need to answer this multiple-choice question about which of the given particles is not associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry. The options are Phonon, Magnon, Skyrmion, and Pion. Hmm, let me think through each one step by step.
First, I remember that spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs when a physical system is invariant under a certain symmetry group, but the ground state of the system is not. This often leads to the appearance of new particles called Goldstone bosons, which are massless (or light) particles associated with the broken symmetry. But wait, some of these particles might not be Goldstone bosons, I need to recall what each one is.
Let's start with option A: Phonon. A phonon is a quantized unit of lattice vibration in a solid. It's like a sound wave or a mechanical vibration. But is the phonon associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking? I think phonons are more related to the vibrations of the crystal lattice, so maybe they're not directly related to spontaneous symmetry breaking. Wait, but maybe in some contexts? Let me be careful here.
Next, option B: Magnon. A magnon is a quasiparticle that represents a quantized spin wave in a magnetic material. Spin waves arise due to the alignment of spins in a magnetic lattice. I think magnons can be considered as Goldstone bosons resulting from the spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry in a ferromagnet. For example, in a ferromagnet below the Curie temperature, the continuous rotational symmetry is broken down to a discrete symmetry, leading to Goldstone bosons, which are the magnons. So magnons are associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking.
Option C: Skyrmion. A Skyrmion is a topological soliton solution in a field theory with a symmetry breaking potential. The Skyrmion is a type of extended object, often considered in nuclear physics as a model for baryons. But how is it related to spontaneous symmetry breaking? I think Skyrmions can exist in systems with spontaneous symmetry breaking, but are they themselves the Goldstone bosons? Wait, maybe not. Skyrmions are more like solitons, which are stable, particle-like solutions. But perhaps in some contexts, Skyrmions can be associated with symmetry breaking. For example, in certain condensed matter systems, Skyrmions can emerge as topological defects in spontaneously broken symmetries. So maybe Skyrmions can be related to spontaneous symmetry breaking, but I need to be careful here.
Option D: Pion. Pions are pseudoscalar mesons, which are quark-antiquark bound states. In particle physics, the pions (especially the charged and neutral pions) are often discussed in the context of chiral symmetry breaking in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The pions are considered as the Goldstone bosons of the broken chiral symmetry. The chiral symmetry of the strong interactions is spontaneously broken, leading to the existence of pions as massless (though in reality, they have small masses due to explicit symmetry breaking). So pions are definitely associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking.
Now, going back to the question: which particle is NOT associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry? Let's check each one again.
Phonon (A): Not sure. Are phonons related to symmetry breaking? From what I recall, phonons are just lattice vibrations and don't necessarily arise from symmetry breaking. Maybe they're not. For example, in a crystal lattice, the symmetry is broken due to the periodic structure, but the phonons are the excitations of this structure. But maybe the breaking of translational symmetry in a crystal gives rise to phonons as Goldstone bosons? Wait, that's an interesting point. In a crystal, the continuous translational symmetry is broken down to a discrete symmetry due to the lattice, which should lead to Goldstone bosons. But are these Goldstone bosons the phonons? Maybe so. Translational symmetry breaking would lead to Goldstone bosons corresponding to the massless excitations associated with translation, which could be related to phonons. Hmm. So if that's the case, then phonons would be associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking. But then the question is which one is NOT associated. Wait, maybe the answer is different.
Magnon (B): Yes, associated as Goldstone bosons in ferromagnets. So B is associated.
Skyrmion (C): Skyrmions are more topological objects, but maybe in some cases related to symmetry breaking. However, they're not Goldstone bosons. For example, in the Skyrme model, the Skyrmion is a soliton that can be a baryon, but chiral symmetry breaking gives pions. So maybe Skyrmions are not directly associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking. Wait, but maybe in other contexts. Let me think. In liquid crystals, for example, different symmetries are broken, and topological defects can form, which might be called Skyrmions in some cases. But I'm not entirely sure. If Skyrmions are topological defects rather than Goldstone bosons, then perhaps they aren't the result of spontaneous symmetry breaking. But maybe their existence is allowed because of symmetry breaking? Hmm, this is getting a bit foggy.
Pion (D): Definitely associated. So D is out.
If the question is which particle is NOT associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry, then between A, B, C, D, if B, C, D are associated, then A is the answer. But I need to confirm.
Wait, but earlier thought about phonons being Goldstone bosons from translational symmetry breaking. If that's the case, then phonons (A) would be associated, so the answer would be C, Skyrmion. But I need to verify this.
Let me check about phonons again. When a continuous translational symmetry is broken (like in going from a liquid to a crystal), the Goldstone bosons would be associated with the broken generators. In a crystal, the continuous translational symmetry is broken to a discrete subgroup, leading to Goldstone bosons which are the phonons. So in that sense, phonons are indeed the result of spontaneous symmetry breaking. So A (Phonon) is associated.
Therefore, the remaining options: B (Magnon) is associated (Goldstone bosons in ferromagnets), C (Skyrmion) – not sure. If Skyrmions are topological defects rather than Goldstone bosons, then they might not be directly associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking. For example, in a system where a symmetry is broken, you can have topological defects like domain walls, vortices, Skyrmions, etc., but these are different from Goldstone bosons. Goldstone bosons are associated with the broken continuous symmetries, while topological defects are related to the way the order parameter is arranged in space. So if a Skyrmion is a topological defect, then it's not a Goldstone boson, but its existence might be permitted by the symmetry breaking. However, is the Skyrmion itself considered as a particle associated with the broken symmetry? Maybe not directly. For instance, in particle physics, pions are the Goldstone bosons in the chiral symmetry breaking scenario, but other topological objects like Skyrmions (which are made of many pions) are different.
So if the question is about which particle is NOT a Goldstone boson resulting from spontaneous symmetry breaking, then Skyrmion would be the answer. But the question says "not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry". If being a topological defect counts as being associated, then Skyrmion is associated. If not, then Skyrmion is the answer.
Alternatively, maybe the question is about which particle is not a result of spontaneous symmetry breaking. For example, if Skyrmions emerge due to other mechanisms, even in systems with symmetry breaking.
But given the options, since phonons, magnons, and pions are all Goldstone bosons (A, B, D), then the answer must be C, Skyrmion. So the answer should be C.
Wait, but let me confirm about Skyrmions once more. In the original Skyrme model, the Skyrmion is a soliton that arises in a theory with chiral symmetry. The chiral symmetry is broken, and the Skyrmion is a topologically stable configuration in the chiral field. So in that case, the existence of the Skyrmion relies on the symmetry breaking, but the Skyrmion itself is not the Goldstone boson. The Goldstone bosons would be pions in the chiral model. So in that sense, the Skyrmion is associated with the symmetry breaking in the sense that the symmetry breaking provides the framework for its existence, but the Skyrmion is not itself a Goldstone boson. However, the question is phrased as "which (effective) particle is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?" So if the Skyrmion's existence depends on the symmetry breaking, then it is associated. But if the question is more specific to Goldstone bosons, then the answer would be C.
Given that all options except maybe C are Goldstone bosons, the answer is C.
**Final Answer**
\boxed{C}
</Think>

Answer: To determine which particle is not associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry, we need to analyze each option:

1. **Phonon (A)**: Phonons are quantized lattice vibrations in a solid. They arise due to the spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry in a crystal structure, making them Goldstone bosons associated with this symmetry breaking.

2. **Magnon (B)**: Magnons are quantized spin waves in magnetic materials. They result from the spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry in ferromagnets, classifying them as Goldstone bosons.

3. **Skyrmion (C)**: A Skyrmion is a topological soliton in field theory, often considered a stable, particle-like solution. While Skyrmions can exist in systems with spontaneous symmetry breaking, they are not Goldstone bosons but rather topological defects. Their existence is due to the symmetry breaking, but they themselves are not the Goldstone bosons associated with the broken symmetry.

4. **Pion (D)**: Pions are pseudoscalar mesons and are considered Goldstone bosons resulting from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics (QCD).

Thus, while phonons, magnons, and pions are all Goldstone bosons associated with spontaneously broken symmetries, Skyrmions are topological defects and not Goldstone bosons themselves.

The final answer is \boxed{C}.
