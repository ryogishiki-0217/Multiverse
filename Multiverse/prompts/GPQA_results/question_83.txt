Okay, so I need to solve this titration problem where we're diluting acetic acid with water and then titrating it with NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Let me break this down step by step.
First, let's start with the initial solution.
We have 20.00 cm3 of 0.05 M acetic acid.
Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm3 of water.
So the total volume becomes 20.00 + 20.00 = 40.00 cm3.
The concentration of acetic acid will be diluted by half because the volume is doubled.
So the new concentration would be 0.05 M / 2 = 0.025 M.
Wait, is that correct?
Yes, because when you mix equal volumes, the concentration is halved.
So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.
Now, the titration is with 0.1 M NaOH.
First, let's figure out the equivalence point.
At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH added equals the moles of acetic acid initially present.
Let me calculate the moles of acetic acid first.
Original moles of acetic acid: volume in liters multiplied by molarity.
20.00 cm3 is 0.02000 L.
So 0.02000 L * 0.05 mol/L = 0.001 moles.
After dilution, the concentration is halved, but the total moles are the same, right?
Wait, no.
Wait, when you dilute, the moles remain the same.
Wait, hold on.
Let's clarify.
Original moles of acetic acid: 0.02000 L * 0.05 M = 0.001 moles.
When we add 20.00 cm3 of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm3, so the concentration becomes 0.001 moles / 0.04000 L = 0.025 M.
So yes, that's correct.
So the moles at equivalence point: 0.001 moles of acetic acid need 0.001 moles of NaOH.
But NaOH is 0.1 M.
So volume of NaOH needed is moles / molarity: 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm3.
So the equivalence point is at 10.00 cm3 of NaOH added.
Now, the question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence point.
25% titration means 25% of the way to the equivalence point.
Since the equivalence point is 10.00 cm3, 25% would be 2.5 cm3 of NaOH added.
So first, calculate the pH at 2.5 cm3 of 0.1 M NaOH added to the 40.00 cm3 of 0.025 M acetic acid.
Then, calculate the pH at the equivalence point.
Let's start with the pH at 25% titration.
This is a point before equivalence, so we'll have a buffer solution of acetic acid and acetate ion (from the reaction of NaOH with acetic acid).
So we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here.
First, let's compute the moles of NaOH added at 2.5 cm3.
Volume in liters is 0.0025 L.
Molarity is 0.1 M, so moles is 0.0025 * 0.1 = 0.00025 moles.
The NaOH will react with the acetic acid to form acetate and water.
So moles of acetic acid initially: 0.001 moles.
Moles of NaOH added: 0.00025 moles.
So moles of acetic acid remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.
Moles of acetate ion (from the reaction) formed: 0.00025 moles.
The total volume after adding 2.5 cm3 of NaOH to the initial 40.00 cm3 solution: 40.00 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm3 = 0.0425 L.
Wait, but Henderson-Hasselbalch just needs the ratio of concentrations, which is the same as the ratio of moles (since volume cancels out).
So pH = pKa + log ([A-]/[HA])
The pKa of acetic acid is -log(Ka) = -log(1.85e-5).
Let me compute that.
First, let me calculate the pKa.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: The value of log(1.85).
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: The value of log(10^-5).
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The value of log(1.85) is approximately 0.267.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The value of log(10^-5) is determined to be -5.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The calculated value of log(1.85) is 0.267, and the value of log(10^-5) is -5.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
Therefore, -log(1.85e-5) = - ( -5 + log1.85 ) = 5 - 0.267 = 4.733.
So pKa ≈ 4.733.
Alternatively, pKa = 4.73.
Wait, actually, the problem states the Ka is 1.85e-5.
Let me compute pKa precisely.
log(1.85) is approx 0.267.
So log(1.85e-5) = log(1.85) + log(1e-5) = 0.267 -5 = -4.733.
Therefore, pKa = -log(Ka) = 4.733.
So approximately 4.73.
So the pKa is 4.73.
Now, back to the buffer.
At 25% titration, [A-]/[HA] = moles of acetate / moles of acetic acid = 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3.
So pH = 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 + log(0.333...).
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: The value of log(0.333...).
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: The value of log(1/3).
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The value of log(0.333...) is calculated as log(1) minus log(3), which equals 0 - 0.4771, or approximately -0.4771.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The value of log(1/3) is calculated as log(1) minus log(3), which simplifies to 0 - log(3), or -log(3). Given that log(3) is approximately 0.477, log(1/3) is approximately -0.477.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The calculated value of log(0.333...) is approximately -0.477, which is consistent with the value of log(1/3).
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So log(1/3) = -0.477.
So pH = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256.
So approximately 4.26.
Wait, but let me check the exact calculation.
pH = 4.73 + log(1/3).
If pKa is exactly 4.73, then.
Let me use more precise numbers.
The Ka is 1.85e-5.
So pKa = -log(1.85e-5).
Let me compute that more accurately.
Let's think in parallel.
<Parallel>
<Goal>
<Outline>
1: The value of log(1.85).
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: The value of log(10^-5).
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The logarithm of 10^-5 is calculated as -5.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The value of 10^-5 is determined to be -5.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The value of log(1.85) is approximately 0.267, and the value of log(10^-5) is -5.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So log(1.85e-5) = log(1.85) + log(1e-5) ≈ 0.267 - 5 = -4.733.
Therefore, pKa = 4.733.
So pKa is approximately 4.73.
Therefore, pH = 4.73 + log (0.00025 / 0.00075).
Wait, the ratio [A-]/[HA] is (0.00025 / 0.0425) / (0.00075 / 0.0425) ) = 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3.
Therefore, log(1/3) ≈ -0.477.
Thus, pH = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 ≈ 4.26.
So that's matching.
So the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26.
Now, the equivalence point.
At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate, and the solution contains only sodium acetate (CH3COONa).
Since it's a salt of a strong base (NaOH) and a weak acid (acetic acid), the solution will be basic.
The pH can be calculated using the hydrolysis of the acetate ion.
The acetate ion will react with water:
CH3COO- + H2O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH-
The equilibrium constant for this reaction is Kb, where Kb = Kw / Ka.
Given that Ka for acetic acid is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1.0e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.
At equivalence point, moles of acetate = initial moles of acetic acid = 0.001 moles.
The volume at equivalence point is the initial volume (40.00 cm3) plus the volume of NaOH added (10.00 cm3), so total volume 50.00 cm3 = 0.050 L.
Therefore, the concentration of acetate ion is 0.001 moles / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.
Now, we need to calculate the pH of 0.02 M sodium acetate solution.
Using the Kb expression:
Kb = [OH-][CH3COOH] / [CH3COO-]
Assuming x is the concentration of OH- produced, then:
x^2 / (0.02 - x) = Kb = 5.405e-10
Since Kb is very small, x is negligible compared to 0.02, so approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02
Therefore:
x^2 ≈ 0.02 * 5.405e-10 = 1.081e-10
Thus, x = sqrt(1.081e-10) ≈ 1.04e-5 M
So [OH-] = 1.04e-5 M
Then pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98
Therefore, pH = 14 - pOH ≈ 14 - 4.98 = 9.02
Wait, this result seems conflicting with the options given.
The options for equivalence point pH are 6.73, 6.92, 7.00, and 8.52.
Wait, but my calculation gives about 9.02, which is not among the options and also doesn't make sense because it's higher than 8.52.
There must be a mistake here.
Wait, let's check.
Kb is 1.0e-14 / 1.85e-5 = 5.405e-10.
That's correct.
Concentration of acetate is 0.02 M.
Then, the hydrolysis:
Kb = [OH-][CH3COOH]/[CH3COO-]
Assuming x is small compared to 0.02, then:
x^2 / 0.02 ≈ 5.405e-10
Then x ≈ sqrt(0.02 * 5.405e-10) = sqrt(1.081e-10) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.
[OH-] = 1.04e-5 M.
So pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98, pH = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
But the options given for equivalence point are higher than 6.73.
So there must be an error in my approach.
Wait, but equivalence point for a weak acid-strong base titration is basic.
So pH should be above 7, around 8-9, which 9.02 is, but the options only go up to 8.52.
Wait, maybe I made a calculation error.
Wait, let me check the Kb calculation again.
1.0e-14 divided by 1.85e-5.
Let's compute that:
1.0e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1.0 / 1.85) * 10^(-14 - (-5)) = 0.5405 * 10^-9 = 5.405e-10.
Correct.
So Kb is 5.405e-10.
Then, for the hydrolysis:
Kb = [OH-][CH3COOH]/[CH3COO-]
Assuming x is the concentration of OH-:
Concentration of acetate ion is 0.02 M.
Then, x^2 ≈ 0.02 * 5.405e-10
x^2 ≈ 1.081e-10
x ≈ 1.039e-5 M
So [OH-] = 1.039e-5 M
pOH = 5 - log(1.039) ≈ 5 - 0.017 ≈ 4.983
So pOH ≈ 4.98, therefore pH = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
But none of the options has 9.02.
The closest is D) 4.26; 8.52, but even that is 8.52.
So where is the mistake?
Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the equivalence point volume calculation?
Let's think again.
Original moles of acetic acid: 0.001 moles.
So to reach equivalence point, we need 0.001 moles of NaOH.
Since NaOH is 0.1 M, volume required is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm3.
So total volume at equivalence point is 40 cm3 (original solution) + 10 cm3 NaOH = 50 cm3.
Concentration of acetate is 0.001 moles / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.
So that's correct.
So, why is the pH calculation giving 9.02 which is not in the options?
Wait, maybe I need to consider the ionic strength and activity coefficients?
But that's usually covered in more advanced courses.
In introductory chemistry, usually, we use the approximation without activities.
Maybe here they used a different assumption?
Alternatively, maybe I made an error in the problem setup.
Wait, maybe the initial dilution affects something?
Wait, the original problem says: "dilute 20.00 cm3 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm3 water, then titrate the resulting solution with 0.1M NaOH".
So when we start the titration, the solution is 0.025 M acetic acid (since concentration is 0.05 M diluted to double volume).
But when adding NaOH, the total volume is 40 cm3 + volume of NaOH.
However, in the options, the equivalence point pH is around 8.52 in option D.
If my calculation gives 9.02, but maybe they are considering the total volume as 40 cm3 instead of 50 cm3?
Wait, no.
At equivalence point, we added 10 cm3 of NaOH.
So total volume is 40 + 10 = 50 cm3.
So acetate concentration is 0.02 M.
Alternatively, maybe they made an approximation in the calculation.
Let's see.
Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the Ka value?
The problem states the Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5.
Yes.
So pKa is 4.73.
Then, Kb = Kw / Ka = 1.0e-14 / 1.85e-5 = 5.405e-10.
Correct.
Alternatively, maybe they used an approximation where they considered the pH at equivalence point as 7?
That's not correct, as it's a salt of a strong base and weak acid.
Wait, but some people mistakenly think that the pH at equivalence point is 7, but no.
Wait, let me check with a different approach.
Maybe using the formula for pH at equivalence point in a weak acid-strong base titration:
pH = (pKw + pKa + log c) / 2 ?
Wait, no, I think the formula is pH = 1/2 (pKw + pKa + log c), but I might be confusing something.
Alternatively, for a salt of a weak acid and strong base, the pH is calculated by:
pH = 1/2 (pKw - pKa) + 1/2 log [salt]
But I need to be careful here.
Alternatively, [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [salt])
Here, Kb = Kw / Ka = 1.0e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10
[salt] = [acetate] = 0.02 M
Therefore, [OH-] = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) ≈ sqrt(1.081e-10) ≈ 1.04e-5 M
pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98
pH = 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02
So again, same result.
But the options do not have this.
The options are 6.73, 6.92, 7.00, 8.52.
So 8.52 is the closest, but my calculation gives around 9.02.
So there's a discrepancy here.
Alternatively, maybe the problem is about the buffer at 25% titration, and then at equivalence point.
Wait, but the equivalence point calculation is definitely giving me pH around 9.02, but the options only go up to 8.52.
So perhaps I made an error in the equivalence point calculation?
Wait, let's see.
Original acetic acid concentration after dilution is 0.025 M.
Volume 40 cm3.
Then equivalence point is when we add 10 cm3 of 0.1 M NaOH, which is 0.001 L * 0.1 M = 0.0001 moles.
Wait, wait.
Wait, original moles of acetic acid: 20 cm3 * 0.05 M = 0.001 moles.
After dilution, the total volume is 40 cm3, but the moles remain 0.001.
So concentration is 0.001 / 0.040 = 0.025 M.
Then, to neutralize 0.001 moles of acetic acid, we need 0.001 moles of NaOH, which is 0.01 L * 0.1 M = 0.001.
But 0.01 L is 10 cm3.
So equivalence point is at 10 cm3.
So total volume after adding NaOH is 40 + 10 = 50 cm3.
Concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.050 = 0.02 M.
So [CH3COO-] = 0.02 M.
Hydrolysis:
CH3COO- + H2O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH-
Kb = 5.405e-10
Assuming x is small compared to 0.02:
Kb = x^2 / 0.02
x = sqrt(0.02 * 5.405e-10) ≈ sqrt(1.081e-10) ≈ 1.04e-5 M
So [OH-] = 1.04e-5 M
pOH = 4.98
pH = 9.02
But the answer choices have 8.52 as the highest.
So this is conflicting.
Wait, maybe I need to use the initial concentration of acetate before dilution?
Wait, no.
When you add NaOH, the total volume increases.
So when calculating the concentration of acetate at equivalence point, you need to consider the volume after adding the NaOH.
Original volume is 40 cm3, adding 10 cm3, total volume 50 cm3.
So concentration is 0.001 moles / 0.050 L = 0.02 M.
That part is correct.
Alternatively, maybe the problem is about the wrong acid or base?
Wait, the problem states acetic acid with Ka = 1.85e-5, which is correct.
The calculations are correct.
Hmm.
Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the initial pH before titration?
But no, the question clearly states that we dilute the acetic acid, then titrate.
So the 25% titration is during the titration before equivalence point.
The pH at 25% addition is 4.26, which matches option D (4.26;8.52).
But equivalence point pH is 9.02, but the answer option D has 8.52.
Alternatively, maybe they used the initial concentration of acetate?
Wait, let me check.
If I ignore the dilution when calculating the concentration of acetate, that is, if I mistakenly take the concentration as 0.001 moles / 0.040 L (not accounting for the added volume), that would be 0.025 M.
Then [OH-] would be sqrt(0.025 * 5.405e-10) ≈ sqrt(1.35e-10) ≈ 1.16e-5 M.
pOH ≈ 4.93, pH ≈ 14 - 4.93 = 9.07, still around 9.
Alternatively, if they didn't consider the dilution at all, thinking that after adding NaOH, the volume is still 40 cm3?
Then the concentration would be 0.001 / 0.040 = 0.025 M, leading to [OH-] = sqrt(0.025 * 5.405e-10) ≈ 1.16e-5, pOH ≈ 4.93, pH ≈ 9.07.
Still not matching.
Alternatively, maybe the equivalence point pH is calculated using the wrong formula?
For example, using pH = pKa + log ([salt]/[acid]), but at equivalence point, that would be invalid because [acid] is zero.
Alternatively, maybe considering the pH at equivalence point for a strong acid and strong base, which is 7.
But in this case, it's a weak acid and strong base, so it should be higher than 7.
Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about a different acid?
Wait, no.
The Ka given is 1.85e-5, which is acetic acid.
Alternatively, maybe the answer provided in the choices is wrong.
But given this is a problem we're to solve, perhaps I need to check calculations once more.
Wait, perhaps the 25% titration calculation is wrong?
Wait, 25% of the way to equivalence point.
Equivalence point is at 10 cm3 NaOH.
So 25% is 2.5 cm3.
So moles of NaOH added: 2.5 cm3 * 0.1 M = 0.00025 moles.
Original moles of acetic acid: 0.001 moles.
After adding 0.00025 moles of NaOH, moles of acetate formed: 0.00025 moles.
Moles of acetic acid remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.
Total volume after adding 2.5 cm3 of NaOH: 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm3 = 0.0425 L.
Therefore:
[acetate] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.00588 M
[acetic acid] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.01765 M
pH = pKa + log ([acetate]/[acetic acid])
pKa = 4.73
log (0.00588 / 0.01765) = log (1/3) ≈ -0.477
Thus, pH = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253 ≈ 4.26.
So that's correct, leading to answer D for the first part.
However, equivalence point pH is 9.02, which is not in the options.
Wait, maybe there is a miscalculation here.
Wait, perhaps they used the initial concentration of acetic acid as 0.05 M?
Let's check.
If someone mistakenly uses the original concentration of 0.05 M instead of after dilution 0.025 M, the equivalence point calculation would be different.
But in this problem, we diluted the acetic acid to 0.025 M.
But the equivalence point pH is governed by the concentration of acetate and its Kb.
Wait, but even if the person forgets the dilution, the acetate concentration would be calculated wrongly.
Alternatively, perhaps the acetate is being treated as a weak base with Kb = Kw / Ka = 1.0e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.4e-10.
Then, if someone incorrectly calculates [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [salt]):
[salt] = [acetate] = 0.02 M.
Then [OH-] = sqrt(5.4e-10 * 0.02) ≈ sqrt(1.08e-10) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.
So pOH = 4.98, pH = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
Alternatively, if they used Kb = 1.85e-5 (incorrect) for the acetate.
Wait, no, Kb is Kw / Ka = 1.0e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.4e-10.
Correct.
Alternatively, maybe they used Kb = 1.85e-5?
That would be wrong.
Alternatively, maybe they used an incorrect assumption about the dilution.
Wait, perhaps the problem statement is incorrect in the given answer options.
Alternatively, perhaps I need to use the initial moles in a different way.
Wait, let's re-express the equilibrium calculation.
At equivalence point, the solution contains 0.001 moles of acetate in 50 cm3 (0.050 L) so concentration 0.02 M.
The hydrolysis equilibrium:
CH3COO- + H2O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH-
Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-] / [CH3COO-] = 5.405e-10
Assuming x mol/L of acetate hydrolyzes, then [CH3COOH] = x, [OH-] = x, [CH3COO-] ≈ 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02
Therefore, x^2 / 0.02 ≈ 5.405e-10
x^2 = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 = 1.081e-10
x = sqrt(1.081e-10) ≈ 1.04e-5 M
So [OH-] = 1.04e-5 M
pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98
pH = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02
So again, same result.
Alternatively, if they used the approximation pH = 1/2 (pKw + pKa) ?
Let's see:
pKw = 14
pKa = 4.73
1/2 (14 + 4.73) = 1/2 (18.73) = 9.365.
Which is different from both our calculated 9.02 and the options.
Alternatively, maybe they used the formula for pH at equivalence point in weak acid-strong base titration:
pH = 7 + 1/2 (pKa + log c)?
Wait, I'm not sure.
Alternatively, since it's the salt of a weak acid and strong base, the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion.
The formula can be:
pH = 14 - (pKa + log ([salt]/Kb)) ?
Wait, I need to check.
Alternatively, using the formula:
pOH = (pKw + log [salt]) / 2 ?
No, that's for a solution of a strong base.
Alternatively, maybe they used the wrong pKa.
The problem states Ka = 1.85e-5, so pKa = 4.73.
If someone mistakenly calculates pKa as 5.73, then:
Then Kb = 1.0e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.4e-10, pKb = 9.26
Then pH = 14 - pKa - pKb?
No, that's not.
Alternatively, using incorrect pKa.
If they thought pKa was 5.73, then:
But no, 1.85e-5's pKa is 4.73.
Alternatively, maybe the problem is incorrectly set, and the equivalence point is elsewhere.
Wait, perhaps the person calculating mistakenly thinks that the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equals the moles of acetic acid in the undiluted sample.
Wait, the problem says we dilute the acetic acid first, then perform the titration.
So the moles of acetic acid after dilution are 0.001 moles.
So equivalence point is when 0.001 moles of NaOH is added, which is 10 cm3 of 0.1 M NaOH.
So the total volume at equivalence is 50 cm3, acetate concentration 0.02 M.
So our calculation is correct.
Alternatively, perhaps the answer choices have a typo.
For instance, if the equivalence point pH is 9.02, which isn't listed, but maybe the person who made the problem transposed digits or mistyped 9.02 as 8.52.
Alternatively, maybe they used a different value for Ka.
Let me check if using a different Ka gives the answer 8.52.
Suppose they used a different acid with a pKa around 5.4?
Let me see.
Suppose the pH at equivalence point is 8.52.
Then pOH = 14 - 8.52 = 5.48.
Therefore, [OH-] = 10^-5.48 ≈ 3.31e-6 M.
Then, using [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * [salt])
Kb = [OH-]^2 / [salt] ≈ (3.31e-6)^2 / 0.02 ≈ 1.096e-11 / 0.02 ≈ 5.48e-10.
Wait, Kb is around 5.48e-10.
But our calculated Kb was 5.405e-10.
Close.
If they used a slightly different Ka.
Alternatively, if the problem states Ka = 1.85e-5, which is correct.
Alternatively, perhaps in the problem, Ka is 1.75e-5?
Let's see.
If Ka = 1.75e-5, pKa ≈ 4.76.
Then Kb = 1.0e-14 / 1.75e-5 ≈ 5.71e-10
Then [OH-] = sqrt(5.71e-10 * 0.02) ≈ sqrt(1.142e-10) ≈ 1.068e-5 M
pOH = 4.97
pH = 14 - 4.97 = 9.03
Still not matching 8.52.
Alternatively, maybe they used Ka = 1.0e-5.
Then pKa = 5.
Kb = 1.0e-9.
[OH-] = sqrt(1.0e-9 * 0.02) ≈ sqrt(2.0e-10) ≈ 4.47e-5 M.
pOH ≈ 4.35
pH ≈ 14 - 4.35 = 9.65
Not 8.52.
Alternatively, maybe the problem is using a different approach where they consider the pH at equivalence point is determined by the concentration of acetate.
But even so, using the formula:
pH = 14 - (pKa + log([acetate]) ).
But that is not correct.
Alternatively, since at equivalence point, the solution is acetate, which hydrolyzes to give pH >7.
The correct way is using Kb and [OH-].
But according to calculations, it's 9.02.
Therefore, there might be a mistake in the problem's answer choices.

<think>
okay, so i need to solve this titration problem where we're diluting acetic acid with water and then titrating it with naoh. the question is asking for the ph at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. let me break this down step by step.
first, let's start with the initial solution.
we have 20.00 cm3 of 0.05 m acetic acid.
then we dilute it with 20.00 cm3 of water.
so the total volume becomes 20.00 + 20.00 = 40.00 cm3.
the concentration of acetic acid will be diluted by half because the volume is doubled.
so the new concentration would be 0.05 m / 2 = 0.025 m.
wait, is that correct?
yes, because when you mix equal volumes, the concentration is halved.
so the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 m.
now, the titration is with 0.1 m naoh.
first, let's figure out the equivalence point.
at the equivalence point, moles of naoh added equals the moles of acetic acid initially present.
let me calculate the moles of acetic acid first.
original moles of acetic acid: volume in liters multiplied by molarity.
20.00 cm3 is 0.02000 l.
so 0.02000 l * 0.05 mol/l = 0.001 moles.
after dilution, the concentration is halved, but the total moles are the same, right?
wait, no.
wait, when you dilute, the moles remain the same.
wait, hold on.
let's clarify.
original moles of acetic acid: 0.02000 l * 0.05 m = 0.001 moles.
when we add 20.00 cm3 of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm3, so the concentration becomes 0.001 moles / 0.04000 l = 0.025 m.
so yes, that's correct.
so the moles at equivalence point: 0.001 moles of acetic acid need 0.001 moles of naoh.
but naoh is 0.1 m.
so volume of naoh needed is moles / molarity: 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/l = 0.01 l = 10.00 cm3.
so the equivalence point is at 10.00 cm3 of naoh added.
now, the question is asking for the ph at 25% titration and at equivalence point.
25% titration means 25% of the way to the equivalence point.
since the equivalence point is 10.00 cm3, 25% would be 2.5 cm3 of naoh added.
so first, calculate the ph at 2.5 cm3 of 0.1 m naoh added to the 40.00 cm3 of 0.025 m acetic acid.
then, calculate the ph at the equivalence point.
let's start with the ph at 25% titration.
this is a point before equivalence, so we'll have a buffer solution of acetic acid and acetate ion (from the reaction of naoh with acetic acid).
so we can use the henderson-hasselbalch equation here.
first, let's compute the moles of naoh added at 2.5 cm3.
volume in liters is 0.0025 l.
molarity is 0.1 m, so moles is 0.0025 * 0.1 = 0.00025 moles.
the naoh will react with the acetic acid to form acetate and water.
so moles of acetic acid initially: 0.001 moles.
moles of naoh added: 0.00025 moles.
so moles of acetic acid remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.
moles of acetate ion (from the reaction) formed: 0.00025 moles.
the total volume after adding 2.5 cm3 of naoh to the initial 40.00 cm3 solution: 40.00 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm3 = 0.0425 l.
wait, but henderson-hasselbalch just needs the ratio of concentrations, which is the same as the ratio of moles (since volume cancels out).
so ph = pka + log ([a-]/[ha])
the pka of acetic acid is -log(ka) = -log(1.85e-5).
let me compute that.
first, let me calculate the pka.
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>
<goal>
<outline>
1: the value of log(1.85).
</outline>
<outline>
2: the value of log(10^-5).
</outline>
</goal>
<path>
1: the value of log(1.85) is approximately 0.267.
</path>
<path>
2: the value of log(10^-5) is determined to be -5.
</path>
<conclusion>
the calculated value of log(1.85) is 0.267, and the value of log(10^-5) is -5.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
therefore, -log(1.85e-5) = - ( -5 + log1.85 ) = 5 - 0.267 = 4.733.
so pka ≈ 4.733.
alternatively, pka = 4.73.
wait, actually, the problem states the ka is 1.85e-5.
let me compute pka precisely.
log(1.85) is approx 0.267.
so log(1.85e-5) = log(1.85) + log(1e-5) = 0.267 -5 = -4.733.
therefore, pka = -log(ka) = 4.733.
so approximately 4.73.
so the pka is 4.73.
now, back to the buffer.
at 25% titration, [a-]/[ha] = moles of acetate / moles of acetic acid = 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3.
so ph = 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 + log(0.333...).
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>
<goal>
<outline>
1: the value of log(0.333...).
</outline>
<outline>
2: the value of log(1/3).
</outline>
</goal>
<path>
1: the value of log(0.333...) is calculated as log(1) minus log(3), which equals 0 - 0.4771, or approximately -0.4771.
</path>
<path>
2: the value of log(1/3) is calculated as log(1) minus log(3), which simplifies to 0 - log(3), or -log(3). given that log(3) is approximately 0.477, log(1/3) is approximately -0.477.
</path>
<conclusion>
the calculated value of log(0.333...) is approximately -0.477, which is consistent with the value of log(1/3).
</conclusion>
</parallel>
so log(1/3) = -0.477.
so ph = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256.
so approximately 4.26.
wait, but let me check the exact calculation.
ph = 4.73 + log(1/3).
if pka is exactly 4.73, then.
let me use more precise numbers.
the ka is 1.85e-5.
so pka = -log(1.85e-5).
let me compute that more accurately.
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>
<goal>
<outline>
1: the value of log(1.85).
</outline>
<outline>
2: the value of log(10^-5).
</outline>
</goal>
<path>
1: the logarithm of 10^-5 is calculated as -5.
</path>
<path>
2: the value of 10^-5 is determined to be -5.
</path>
<conclusion>
the value of log(1.85) is approximately 0.267, and the value of log(10^-5) is -5.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
so log(1.85e-5) = log(1.85) + log(1e-5) ≈ 0.267 - 5 = -4.733.
therefore, pka = 4.733.
so pka is approximately 4.73.
therefore, ph = 4.73 + log (0.00025 / 0.00075).
wait, the ratio [a-]/[ha] is (0.00025 / 0.0425) / (0.00075 / 0.0425) ) = 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3.
therefore, log(1/3) ≈ -0.477.
thus, ph = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 ≈ 4.26.
so that's matching.
so the ph at 25% titration is approximately 4.26.
now, the equivalence point.
at equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate, and the solution contains only sodium acetate (ch3coona).
since it's a salt of a strong base (naoh) and a weak acid (acetic acid), the solution will be basic.
the ph can be calculated using the hydrolysis of the acetate ion.
the acetate ion will react with water:
ch3coo- + h2o ⇌ ch3cooh + oh-
the equilibrium constant for this reaction is kb, where kb = kw / ka.
given that ka for acetic acid is 1.85e-5, so kb = 1.0e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.
at equivalence point, moles of acetate = initial moles of acetic acid = 0.001 moles.
the volume at equivalence point is the initial volume (40.00 cm3) plus the volume of naoh added (10.00 cm3), so total volume 50.00 cm3 = 0.050 l.
therefore, the concentration of acetate ion is 0.001 moles / 0.050 l = 0.02 m.
now, we need to calculate the ph of 0.02 m sodium acetate solution.
using the kb expression:
kb = [oh-][ch3cooh] / [ch3coo-]
assuming x is the concentration of oh- produced, then:
x^2 / (0.02 - x) = kb = 5.405e-10
since kb is very small, x is negligible compared to 0.02, so approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02
therefore:
x^2 ≈ 0.02 * 5.405e-10 = 1.081e-10
thus, x = sqrt(1.081e-10) ≈ 1.04e-5 m
so [oh-] = 1.04e-5 m
then poh = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98
therefore, ph = 14 - poh ≈ 14 - 4.98 = 9.02
wait, this result seems conflicting with the options given.
the options for equivalence point ph are 6.73, 6.92, 7.00, and 8.52.
wait, but my calculation gives about 9.02, which is not among the options and also doesn't make sense because it's higher than 8.52.
there must be a mistake here.
wait, let's check.
kb is 1.0e-14 / 1.85e-5 = 5.405e-10.
that's correct.
concentration of acetate is 0.02 m.
then, the hydrolysis:
kb = [oh-][ch3cooh]/[ch3coo-]
assuming x is small compared to 0.02, then:
x^2 / 0.02 ≈ 5.405e-10
then x ≈ sqrt(0.02 * 5.405e-10) = sqrt(1.081e-10) ≈ 1.04e-5 m.
[oh-] = 1.04e-5 m.
so poh = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98, ph = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
but the options given for equivalence point are higher than 6.73.
so there must be an error in my approach.
wait, but equivalence point for a weak acid-strong base titration is basic.
so ph should be above 7, around 8-9, which 9.02 is, but the options only go up to 8.52.
wait, maybe i made a calculation error.
wait, let me check the kb calculation again.
1.0e-14 divided by 1.85e-5.
let's compute that:
1.0e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1.0 / 1.85) * 10^(-14 - (-5)) = 0.5405 * 10^-9 = 5.405e-10.
correct.
so kb is 5.405e-10.
then, for the hydrolysis:
kb = [oh-][ch3cooh]/[ch3coo-]
assuming x is the concentration of oh-:
concentration of acetate ion is 0.02 m.
then, x^2 ≈ 0.02 * 5.405e-10
x^2 ≈ 1.081e-10
x ≈ 1.039e-5 m
so [oh-] = 1.039e-5 m
poh = 5 - log(1.039) ≈ 5 - 0.017 ≈ 4.983
so poh ≈ 4.98, therefore ph = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
but none of the options has 9.02.
the closest is d) 4.26; 8.52, but even that is 8.52.
so where is the mistake?
wait, maybe i made a mistake in the equivalence point volume calculation?
let's think again.
original moles of acetic acid: 0.001 moles.
so to reach equivalence point, we need 0.001 moles of naoh.
since naoh is 0.1 m, volume required is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 l = 10 cm3.
so total volume at equivalence point is 40 cm3 (original solution) + 10 cm3 naoh = 50 cm3.
concentration of acetate is 0.001 moles / 0.050 l = 0.02 m.
so that's correct.
so, why is the ph calculation giving 9.02 which is not in the options?
wait, maybe i need to consider the ionic strength and activity coefficients?
but that's usually covered in more advanced courses.
in introductory chemistry, usually, we use the approximation without activities.
maybe here they used a different assumption?
alternatively, maybe i made an error in the problem setup.
wait, maybe the initial dilution affects something?
wait, the original problem says: "dilute 20.00 cm3 0.05 m acetic acid with 20.00 cm3 water, then titrate the resulting solution with 0.1m naoh".
so when we start the titration, the solution is 0.025 m acetic acid (since concentration is 0.05 m diluted to double volume).
but when adding naoh, the total volume is 40 cm3 + volume of naoh.
however, in the options, the equivalence point ph is around 8.52 in option d.
if my calculation gives 9.02, but maybe they are considering the total volume as 40 cm3 instead of 50 cm3?
wait, no.
at equivalence point, we added 10 cm3 of naoh.
so total volume is 40 + 10 = 50 cm3.
so acetate concentration is 0.02 m.
alternatively, maybe they made an approximation in the calculation.
let's see.
alternatively, perhaps i messed up the ka value?
the problem states the ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5.
yes.
so pka is 4.73.
then, kb = kw / ka = 1.0e-14 / 1.85e-5 = 5.405e-10.
correct.
alternatively, maybe they used an approximation where they considered the ph at equivalence point as 7?
that's not correct, as it's a salt of a strong base and weak acid.
wait, but some people mistakenly think that the ph at equivalence point is 7, but no.
wait, let me check with a different approach.
maybe using the formula for ph at equivalence point in a weak acid-strong base titration:
ph = (pkw + pka + log c) / 2 ?
wait, no, i think the formula is ph = 1/2 (pkw + pka + log c), but i might be confusing something.
alternatively, for a salt of a weak acid and strong base, the ph is calculated by:
ph = 1/2 (pkw - pka) + 1/2 log [salt]
but i need to be careful here.
alternatively, [oh-] = sqrt(kb * [salt])
here, kb = kw / ka = 1.0e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10
[salt] = [acetate] = 0.02 m
therefore, [oh-] = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) ≈ sqrt(1.081e-10) ≈ 1.04e-5 m
poh = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98
ph = 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02
so again, same result.
but the options do not have this.
the options are 6.73, 6.92, 7.00, 8.52.
so 8.52 is the closest, but my calculation gives around 9.02.
so there's a discrepancy here.
alternatively, maybe the problem is about the buffer at 25% titration, and then at equivalence point.
wait, but the equivalence point calculation is definitely giving me ph around 9.02, but the options only go up to 8.52.
so perhaps i made an error in the equivalence point calculation?
wait, let's see.
original acetic acid concentration after dilution is 0.025 m.
volume 40 cm3.
then equivalence point is when we add 10 cm3 of 0.1 m naoh, which is 0.001 l * 0.1 m = 0.0001 moles.
wait, wait.
wait, original moles of acetic acid: 20 cm3 * 0.05 m = 0.001 moles.
after dilution, the total volume is 40 cm3, but the moles remain 0.001.
so concentration is 0.001 / 0.040 = 0.025 m.
then, to neutralize 0.001 moles of acetic acid, we need 0.001 moles of naoh, which is 0.01 l * 0.1 m = 0.001.
but 0.01 l is 10 cm3.
so equivalence point is at 10 cm3.
so total volume after adding naoh is 40 + 10 = 50 cm3.
concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.050 = 0.02 m.
so [ch3coo-] = 0.02 m.
hydrolysis:
ch3coo- + h2o ⇌ ch3cooh + oh-
kb = 5.405e-10
assuming x is small compared to 0.02:
kb = x^2 / 0.02
x = sqrt(0.02 * 5.405e-10) ≈ sqrt(1.081e-10) ≈ 1.04e-5 m
so [oh-] = 1.04e-5 m
poh = 4.98
ph = 9.02
but the answer choices have 8.52 as the highest.
so this is conflicting.
wait, maybe i need to use the initial concentration of acetate before dilution?
wait, no.
when you add naoh, the total volume increases.
so when calculating the concentration of acetate at equivalence point, you need to consider the volume after adding the naoh.
original volume is 40 cm3, adding 10 cm3, total volume 50 cm3.
so concentration is 0.001 moles / 0.050 l = 0.02 m.
that part is correct.
alternatively, maybe the problem is about the wrong acid or base?
wait, the problem states acetic acid with ka = 1.85e-5, which is correct.
the calculations are correct.
hmm.
alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the initial ph before titration?
but no, the question clearly states that we dilute the acetic acid, then titrate.
so the 25% titration is during the titration before equivalence point.
the ph at 25% addition is 4.26, which matches option d (4.26;8.52).
but equivalence point ph is 9.02, but the answer option d has 8.52.
alternatively, maybe they used the initial concentration of acetate?
wait, let me check.
if i ignore the dilution when calculating the concentration of acetate, that is, if i mistakenly take the concentration as 0.001 moles / 0.040 l (not accounting for the added volume), that would be 0.025 m.
then [oh-] would be sqrt(0.025 * 5.405e-10) ≈ sqrt(1.35e-10) ≈ 1.16e-5 m.
poh ≈ 4.93, ph ≈ 14 - 4.93 = 9.07, still around 9.
alternatively, if they didn't consider the dilution at all, thinking that after adding naoh, the volume is still 40 cm3?
then the concentration would be 0.001 / 0.040 = 0.025 m, leading to [oh-] = sqrt(0.025 * 5.405e-10) ≈ 1.16e-5, poh ≈ 4.93, ph ≈ 9.07.
still not matching.
alternatively, maybe the equivalence point ph is calculated using the wrong formula?
for example, using ph = pka + log ([salt]/[acid]), but at equivalence point, that would be invalid because [acid] is zero.
alternatively, maybe considering the ph at equivalence point for a strong acid and strong base, which is 7.
but in this case, it's a weak acid and strong base, so it should be higher than 7.
alternatively, perhaps the problem is about a different acid?
wait, no.
the ka given is 1.85e-5, which is acetic acid.
alternatively, maybe the answer provided in the choices is wrong.
but given this is a problem we're to solve, perhaps i need to check calculations once more.
wait, perhaps the 25% titration calculation is wrong?
wait, 25% of the way to equivalence point.
equivalence point is at 10 cm3 naoh.
so 25% is 2.5 cm3.
so moles of naoh added: 2.5 cm3 * 0.1 m = 0.00025 moles.
original moles of acetic acid: 0.001 moles.
after adding 0.00025 moles of naoh, moles of acetate formed: 0.00025 moles.
moles of acetic acid remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.
total volume after adding 2.5 cm3 of naoh: 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm3 = 0.0425 l.
therefore:
[acetate] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.00588 m
[acetic acid] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.01765 m
ph = pka + log ([acetate]/[acetic acid])
pka = 4.73
log (0.00588 / 0.01765) = log (1/3) ≈ -0.477
thus, ph = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253 ≈ 4.26.
so that's correct, leading to answer d for the first part.
however, equivalence point ph is 9.02, which is not in the options.
wait, maybe there is a miscalculation here.
wait, perhaps they used the initial concentration of acetic acid as 0.05 m?
let's check.
if someone mistakenly uses the original concentration of 0.05 m instead of after dilution 0.025 m, the equivalence point calculation would be different.
but in this problem, we diluted the acetic acid to 0.025 m.
but the equivalence point ph is governed by the concentration of acetate and its kb.
wait, but even if the person forgets the dilution, the acetate concentration would be calculated wrongly.
alternatively, perhaps the acetate is being treated as a weak base with kb = kw / ka = 1.0e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.4e-10.
then, if someone incorrectly calculates [oh-] = sqrt(kb * [salt]):
[salt] = [acetate] = 0.02 m.
then [oh-] = sqrt(5.4e-10 * 0.02) ≈ sqrt(1.08e-10) ≈ 1.04e-5 m.
so poh = 4.98, ph = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
alternatively, if they used kb = 1.85e-5 (incorrect) for the acetate.
wait, no, kb is kw / ka = 1.0e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.4e-10.
correct.
alternatively, maybe they used kb = 1.85e-5?
that would be wrong.
alternatively, maybe they used an incorrect assumption about the dilution.
wait, perhaps the problem statement is incorrect in the given answer options.
alternatively, perhaps i need to use the initial moles in a different way.
wait, let's re-express the equilibrium calculation.
at equivalence point, the solution contains 0.001 moles of acetate in 50 cm3 (0.050 l) so concentration 0.02 m.
the hydrolysis equilibrium:
ch3coo- + h2o ⇌ ch3cooh + oh-
kb = [ch3cooh][oh-] / [ch3coo-] = 5.405e-10
assuming x mol/l of acetate hydrolyzes, then [ch3cooh] = x, [oh-] = x, [ch3coo-] ≈ 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02
therefore, x^2 / 0.02 ≈ 5.405e-10
x^2 = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 = 1.081e-10
x = sqrt(1.081e-10) ≈ 1.04e-5 m
so [oh-] = 1.04e-5 m
poh = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98
ph = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02
so again, same result.
alternatively, if they used the approximation ph = 1/2 (pkw + pka) ?
let's see:
pkw = 14
pka = 4.73
1/2 (14 + 4.73) = 1/2 (18.73) = 9.365.
which is different from both our calculated 9.02 and the options.
alternatively, maybe they used the formula for ph at equivalence point in weak acid-strong base titration:
ph = 7 + 1/2 (pka + log c)?
wait, i'm not sure.
alternatively, since it's the salt of a weak acid and strong base, the ph is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion.
the formula can be:
ph = 14 - (pka + log ([salt]/kb)) ?
wait, i need to check.
alternatively, using the formula:
poh = (pkw + log [salt]) / 2 ?
no, that's for a solution of a strong base.
alternatively, maybe they used the wrong pka.
the problem states ka = 1.85e-5, so pka = 4.73.
if someone mistakenly calculates pka as 5.73, then:
then kb = 1.0e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.4e-10, pkb = 9.26
then ph = 14 - pka - pkb?
no, that's not.
alternatively, using incorrect pka.
if they thought pka was 5.73, then:
but no, 1.85e-5's pka is 4.73.
alternatively, maybe the problem is incorrectly set, and the equivalence point is elsewhere.
wait, perhaps the person calculating mistakenly thinks that the equivalence point is when moles of naoh equals the moles of acetic acid in the undiluted sample.
wait, the problem says we dilute the acetic acid first, then perform the titration.
so the moles of acetic acid after dilution are 0.001 moles.
so equivalence point is when 0.001 moles of naoh is added, which is 10 cm3 of 0.1 m naoh.
so the total volume at equivalence is 50 cm3, acetate concentration 0.02 m.
so our calculation is correct.
alternatively, perhaps the answer choices have a typo.
for instance, if the equivalence point ph is 9.02, which isn't listed, but maybe the person who made the problem transposed digits or mistyped 9.02 as 8.52.
alternatively, maybe they used a different value for ka.
let me check if using a different ka gives the answer 8.52.
suppose they used a different acid with a pka around 5.4?
let me see.
suppose the ph at equivalence point is 8.52.
then poh = 14 - 8.52 = 5.48.
therefore, [oh-] = 10^-5.48 ≈ 3.31e-6 m.
then, using [oh-] = sqrt(kb * [salt])
kb = [oh-]^2 / [salt] ≈ (3.31e-6)^2 / 0.02 ≈ 1.096e-11 / 0.02 ≈ 5.48e-10.
wait, kb is around 5.48e-10.
but our calculated kb was 5.405e-10.
close.
if they used a slightly different ka.
alternatively, if the problem states ka = 1.85e-5, which is correct.
alternatively, perhaps in the problem, ka is 1.75e-5?
let's see.
if ka = 1.75e-5, pka ≈ 4.76.
then kb = 1.0e-14 / 1.75e-5 ≈ 5.71e-10
then [oh-] = sqrt(5.71e-10 * 0.02) ≈ sqrt(1.142e-10) ≈ 1.068e-5 m
poh = 4.97
ph = 14 - 4.97 = 9.03
still not matching 8.52.
alternatively, maybe they used ka = 1.0e-5.
then pka = 5.
kb = 1.0e-9.
[oh-] = sqrt(1.0e-9 * 0.02) ≈ sqrt(2.0e-10) ≈ 4.47e-5 m.
poh ≈ 4.35
ph ≈ 14 - 4.35 = 9.65
not 8.52.
alternatively, maybe the problem is using a different approach where they consider the ph at equivalence point is determined by the concentration of acetate.
but even so, using the formula:
ph = 14 - (pka + log([acetate]) ).
but that is not correct.
alternatively, since at equivalence point, the solution is acetate, which hydrolyzes to give ph >7.
the correct way is using kb and [oh-].
but according to calculations, it's 9.02.
therefore, there might be a mistake in the problem's answer choices.
however, since this is a question given to me, and the options are a)3.17;6.73 b)4.57;6.92
