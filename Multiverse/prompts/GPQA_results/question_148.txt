Okay, so I need to solve this chemistry problem. It's about binary compounds of fluorine with an element Y. There are five compounds labeled A1 to A5, and I need to figure out the molar mass of A4 based on the given information. The answer choices are A) 140-160, B) 160-180, C) 110-130, D) 220-240.
Let's think in parallel.

<Outline>
1: Analyze the decomposition of A1 into A2 and F2, and the oxidation of Xe by A1 and A3.
</Outline>
<Outline>
2: Analyze the synthesis of A5 from Y and A4, and its decomposition in water.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: Let's go through the problem step by step. First, the problem mentions that A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K into A2 (which has a fluoride content ωF = 31.96%) and fluorine. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Then A3 can interact with xenon as well and is obtained by fluorinating element Y with fluorine. Adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to hot, colorless, concentrated A4 solution gives A5. A5 decomposes in water to form two substances. Need to find the molar mass of A4.
Let's think in parallel.

<Goal>
<Outline>
1.1: Determine the identity of element Y based on its ability to oxidize Xe.
</Outline>
<Outline>
1.2: Determine the identity of element Y based on its ability to form A3 through fluorination.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1.1: First, figuring out what element Y is. Since A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is normally inert, but if A1 can oxidize it, A1 must be a strong oxidizing agent. Fluorine is the strongest oxidizing agent, so compounds of F with high oxidation states might be strong oxidizers. Also, element Y must be able to form multiple binary compounds with fluorine. Binary compounds of fluorine with element Y—so Y must be a metal or nonmetal that can form multiple fluorides.
</Path>
<Path>
1.2: Second, A3 is formed by fluorinating element Y with fluorine. So Y must be a metal that can form fluorides. Given that Y can form multiple binary compounds with F, likely a metal from the first few groups (like group 1, 2, maybe 13 or 14 states). But considering A1 oxidizes Xe, which is a noble gas, this suggests A1 is a strong oxidizing agent. Xenon is inert, but under certain conditions can be oxidized by strong oxidizers like F2 or perhaps other highly oxidizing fluorides. The fact that A1 can oxidize Xe implies A1 is a powerful oxidizer, possibly a fluoride of a metal in a high oxidation state. Alternatively, since A3 can also interact with Xe, maybe A3 is another fluoride of Y that can react with Xe, perhaps under different conditions. The element Y must therefore be one that forms fluorides capable of oxidizing Xe. This might narrow down the possibilities.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The element Y is likely a metal capable of high oxidation states, such as those found in groups 1, 2, 13, or 14. The ability of A1 to oxidize Xe implies Y is a strong oxidizer, possibly in a high oxidation state. Y is also capable of forming multiple fluorides, including A3, which can react with Xe.

2: Then, adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot solution of A4 gives A5. A5 decomposes in water into two substances. So, A4 is a compound of Y and F, probably. Let's think step by step. First, element Y. What element is Y? The key here is probably xenon. The problem mentions that A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is inert, but under certain conditions, like with strong oxidizers, it can form compounds. The first noble gas compound was xenon hexafluoride. So maybe Y is xenon? Let's check. If Y is xenon, its binary compounds with fluorine would be XeF2, XeF4, XeF6, etc. Wait, but there are five compounds here. Wait, the problem says five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known. So Y could be another element that forms multiple fluorides. Alternatively, maybe Y is another element, but the fact that A1 oxidizes xenon suggests that A1 is a strong oxidizing agent. Known strong oxidizing agents involving fluorine include things like oxygen difluoride (OF2), but more likely, something like xenon difluoride or another xenon fluoride. Wait, but if Y is xenon, then the compounds could be XeF2, XeF4, XeF6, etc. But there are five of them. Wait, actually, xenon forms several fluorides: XeF2, XeF4, XeF6, and also XeF3^+ related compounds, but I'm not sure if there are five established ones. Alternatively, maybe Y is not xenon but another element that forms multiple fluorides, and the interaction with xenon is through some redox reaction. Wait, the problem states that A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. So A1 must be a strong oxidizing agent. Let's consider possible fluorides that are strong oxidizers. For example, ClF3 is a strong oxidizing agent, but that's chlorine, not a noble gas. If Y is a noble gas, like xenon, then XeF6 is a known strong oxidizing agent. But XeF6 is a gas at room temperature. The problem says A1 is a bright-red substance. So, XeF6 is a colorless gas. Hmm, that might not match. What about XeF4? The colors of xenon fluorides: XeF2 is a pale yellow liquid, XeF4 is a yellow crystalline solid, XeF6 is a colorless gas. Wait, but maybe the bright-red substance is a different compound. Alternatively, maybe Y is not xenon but another element. Let's think of other elements that form multiple fluorides. For example, sulfur forms SF2, S2F2, SF4, SF6, but how many? Alternatively, phosphorus or arsenic. Wait, but the interaction with xenon might be a key here. If A1 oxidizes xenon, which is inert, A1 must be a powerful oxidizer. The most common powerful oxidizers involving fluorine are probably oxygen difluoride (OF2), but that's a gas. Then there's sulfur tetrafluoride (SF4), but it's not a strong oxidizer. Xenon hexafluoride (XeF6) is a strong oxidizing agent. Wait, but XeF6 is a colorless gas. Wait, the problem says A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (ωF = 31.96%) and fluorine. The omega F is the mass percentage of fluorine in A2. So, if A2 has 31.96% F by mass, we can use that to find its formula. Let me calculate. Suppose A2 is a compound of Y and F. Let the molar mass of Y be M. Then, the formula would be YF_n. The mass percentage of F is (n * 19) / (M + 19n) = 31.96%. So, (n * 19) / (M + 19n) = 0.3196. Rearranging, 19n = 0.3196 (M + 19n). 19n = 0.3196M + 6.0724n. Subtract 6.0724n from both sides: 19n - 6.0724n = 0.3196M. 12.9276n = 0.3196M. Therefore, M = (12.9276 / 0.3196) * n. Calculating the coefficient: 12.9276 / 0.3196 ≈ 40.5. So, M ≈ 40.5n. Since M is the molar mass of element Y, which has to be a whole number (approximately), and n is an integer (number of F atoms per Y atom), possible values: If n=1, M≈40.5 → element with molar mass ~40.5. That would be potassium (39), but KF would be K (39) + F (19) = 58. 19/58 ≈ 32.75%, which isn't 31.96%. Hmm. If n=2, M≈81. For YF2: Y's molar mass ≈81. Could be rubidium (85.47), but that's close. Let's check: RbF2. Rb is 85.47, F is 19. So, total molar mass = 85.47 + 2*19 = 85.47 + 38 = 123.47. %F = (38 / 123.47) * 100 ≈ 30.82%. Close to 31.96%, but a bit lower. If n=2, and M≈81. If Y has a molar mass of 81, then compound YF2: molar mass = 81 + 38 = 119. %F = 38/119 *100 ≈ 31.93%, which is 31.96%, close enough considering rounding. So, Y has a molar mass of approximately 81. What element has a molar mass around 81? Mercury is 200. Wait, wait: 81 is close to bromine (80), but bromine is 80, Y can't be bromine (non-metal). Alternatively, Rb is 85.47, which we saw before. Wait, maybe there's another element. Wait, let's check molybdenum (Mo, 95.95), too high. Wait, gallium is 69.72, too low. Wait, maybe Y isn't a metal but another type of element. Wait, but Y is reacting with fluorine, so likely a metal. Wait, perhaps it's not a metal; maybe a metalloid? Wait, but noble gases also form compounds with fluorine, but they aren't metals. Wait, if Y is a noble gas, like xenon, its molar mass is 131. Wait, but 81 is too low. Alternatively, perhaps Y is an element with molar mass 81. Let's check the periodic table. Element with atomic weight approximately 81: bromine is 79.904, krypton is 83.798, ruthenium is 101.07, not really. Wait, maybe indium? In is 114.82, nope. Wait, maybe this approach is wrong. Let me check the calculation again. Given that the percentage of fluorine in A2 is 31.96%, and A2 is YF_n. So, (n * 19) / (M + 19n) = 0.3196. Rearranging gives M = (12.9276 / 0.3196) * n ≈ 40.5n. So for n=1, M≈40.5, which would be potassium (39), but as we saw, KF would have 39% F, which is 19/(39+19)≈33.3%, which is higher than 31.96%. For n=2, M≈81. So Y would have a molar mass of 81. As there is no element with molar mass 81, perhaps the calculation is approximate. The closest element to 81 is bromine (79.9), but it's a halogen and would not form a compound like YF2. Alternatively, maybe Y is not a single element but a mix? No, the problem states it's an element Y. Alternatively, maybe the percentage is not exactly 31.96%, but given the answer choices, perhaps we can proceed with this approximation. Alternatively, maybe A2 is not YF_n but a different stoichiometry. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. If A2 is YF_n, then the percentage of F is (n*19)/(M_Y + n*19) = 31.96%. So, solving for M_Y: (n*19) = 0.3196*(M_Y + 19n) => n*19 = 0.3196*M_Y + 0.3196*19n => n*19 - 0.3196*19n = 0.3196*M_Y => 19n*(1 - 0.3196) = 0.3196*M_Y => 19n*0.6804 = 0.3196*M_Y => M_Y = (19n*0.6804)/0.3196 ≈ (19n*2.128) ≈ 40.43n. So M_Y ≈ 40.43n. So for n=1, M_Y ≈40.43 (potassium is 39), for n=2, M_Y≈80.86. If Y is Rb (85.47), that's close to 80.86, but RbF2's molar mass would be 85.47 + 38 = 123.47, and %F is 38/123.47≈30.82%, which is lower than 31.96%. Alternatively, if Y has a molar mass of 81, then YF2's molar mass is 81 + 38=119, and 38/119≈31.93%, which is very close to 31.96%. So Y's molar mass would be approximately 81. But which element is that? Looking at the periodic table: - Argon: 40, not 81. - Chlorine: 35.5, - Sulfur: 32. - Phosphorus: 31. None near 81. Wait, krypton is 83.8, but it's a noble gas. Wait, could Y be krypton? If Y is krypton (83.80), then YF2 would have molar mass 83.80 + 38 = 121.80. %F is 38 / 121.80 *100≈31.20%, still lower than 31.96%. Alternatively, bromine is 79.90, but it's a halogen. BrF2 would be 79.9 + 38 = 117.9. %F = 38 / 117.9 *100≈32.22%, higher than 31.96%. Not a good match. Wait, maybe the formula is different. Maybe A2 is YF3. Let's check. If A2 is YF3, then: %F = (3*19)/(M + 3*19) = 57/(M + 57) = 0.3196. So, 57 = 0.3196*(M + 57). Then, 57 = 0.3196M + 18.2. Subtract 18.2: 38.8 = 0.3196M. Thus, M ≈ 38.8 / 0.3196 ≈ 121.4. So Y would have a molar mass of ~121. That's indium (114.8), silver (107.87), but none close. Tin is 118.7, close. Let's check: If Y is tin (118.7), then SnF3 would have molar mass 118.7 + 57 = 175.7. %F = 57/175.7 *100 ≈32.49%, which is higher than 31.96%. Alternatively, Y with molar mass 121.4, compound YF3: molar mass 121.4 +57=178.4. %F=57/178.4*100≈31.94%, very close to 31.96%. So A2 could be YF3 where Y has a molar mass of ~121.4. Then Y would be an element with molar mass ~121.4. The closest is tin (118.7) or indium (114.8), but neither fits exactly. Alternatively, maybe the element is not from the periodic table, but that's impossible. Wait, perhaps my assumption of the formula is wrong. Alternatively, maybe A2 is Y2F. Wait, but that would be unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the formula is different. Wait, perhaps A2 is YF. Let me check. If A2 is YF: 19/(M + 19) = 0.3196. So, 19 = 0.3196*(M + 19). Then, 19 = 0.3196M + 6.0724. Subtract: 12.9276 = 0.3196M. So, M ≈ 40.3. Which would be potassium (39), but YF would be KF, molar mass 58.09, %F 32.7%, which is higher than 31.96%. Alternatively, if Y is calcium (40.08), CaF would have molar mass 40.08 + 19 = 59.08, %F =19/59.08≈32.17%, still higher. Not a good fit. Alternatively, maybe the formula is YF4. Let's check. (4*19)/(M + 76) = 0.3196. 76 = 0.3196*(M +76). 76 = 0.3196M +24.27. Subtract: 51.73 =0.3196M. M≈162. So Y would be an element with molar mass ~162. That's osmium (190.23), too high. Not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is YF5. Wait, but this is getting tedious. Let's think differently. The problem says A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine. So, A1 could be YF_m, which upon decomposition gives YF_n (A2) and F2. For example, if A1 is XeF6, which upon heating might decompose into XeF4 (A2) and F2. But XeF6 is a gas, but the problem says A1 is a bright-red substance. Alternatively, maybe A1 is a different compound. Wait, another approach: if A1 is a higher fluoride of Y that decomposes to a lower fluoride (A2) and F2. For example, YF6 → YF4 + F2. If that's the case, and A2 is YF4, which has 31.96% F. Let's check that. If A2 is YF4, then: %F = (4*19)/(M + 76) = 76/(M + 76) = 0.3196. So, 76 = 0.3196*(M +76). Then, 76 = 0.3196M +24.27. Subtract 24.27 from both sides: 51.73 =0.3196M. Therefore, M=51.73/0.3196≈162.2. So, the molar mass of Y is ~162.2. Which element has a molar mass around 162? Osmium is 190, tungsten is 183.84, gold is 197, not really. Wait, element with molar mass ~162: there's none. The closest is platinum (195.08), too high. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe A2 is YF3. Let's check that again. If A2 is YF3, then: 57/(M +57) =0.3196. Solving as before: 57 =0.3196*(M +57); 57 =0.3196M +18.22; 57 -18.22=0.3196M; 38.78=0.3196M; M≈121.37. So Y would have molar mass ~121.37. Tin is 118.7, close. Let's check: if Y is tin, then YF3 is SnF3. Sn (118.7) + 3*19 (57) =175.7. %F=57/175.7≈32.49%, higher than 31.96%. Alternatively, if Y has molar mass 121.37, then YF3 would have molar mass 121.37 +57=178.37. %F=57/178.37≈31.95%, which is very close to 31.96%. So, Y has a molar mass of ~121.37. The closest element is tin (118.7), which is 118.7, so SnF3 would have a slightly higher %F, but maybe in a different oxidation state or if Y is not a real element, but since we have to proceed, maybe Y is tin. But wait, if Y is tin, then A1 decomposes into SnF3 and F2. But A1 oxidizes xenon. SnF3 isn't a known oxidizer of xenon. Alternatively, perhaps Y is lead. Pb has a molar mass of 207.2, which is higher. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe Y is not a metal but a metalloid. Wait, but this is getting confusing. Let's think of the initial problem again. The key points are: 1. A1 is bright red, decomposes at 293 K (20°C, room temperature) into A2 (31.96% F) and F2. 2. A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. 3. A3 is obtained by fluorinating element Y with F2. 4. A5 is formed by adding Y (1:1 molar ratio) to a hot solution of A4. 5. A5 decomposes in water into two substances. The compounds are five binary compounds of Y and F. Let's think of noble gases again. If Y is a noble gas, like xenon, then the known fluorides are XeF2, XeF4, XeF6. But if A1 oxidizes xenon, and is a noble gas fluoride, then perhaps A1 is XeF6, which is a strong oxidizing agent. But XeF6 is a colorless gas. The problem states A1 is bright red. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe Y is another element. Wait, let's think of oxygen fluorides. Oxygen difluoride (OF2) is a gas, not bright red. Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) is a gas, but sulfur also forms SF4 and S2F10. Wait, but sulfur is a possible element Y. Let's check. If Y is sulfur. The binary fluorides of sulfur are S2F10, SF6, SF4, etc. Let's see: If A1 is S2F10 (decomposes to SF6 and F2?), but S2F10 is a colorless gas. Alternatively, maybe A1 is SF6, which decomposes into SF4 and F2. Let's check: SF6 → SF4 + F2. The stoichiometry would be SF6 → SF4 + F2. If A2 is SF4, then the mass % of F in SF4 is (4*19)/ (32 + 76) = 76/108 ≈0.7037, i.e., 70.37% F, which doesn't match 31.96%. Not helpful. Alternatively, maybe Y is a metal. Let's think of metals that form multiple fluorides. For example, boron trifluoride (BF3) but boron isn't a metal. Wait, perhaps element Y is chlorine? No, chlorine forms several interhalogen compounds, but chlorine itself isn't a metal. Wait, let's re-examine the fact that A1 oxidizes xenon. Xenon is inert, but under certain conditions can be oxidized. For example, by strong oxidizing agents like F2, but also by higher fluorides. If Y is a noble gas, like xenon, then XeF6 is a known strong oxidizing agent. XeF6 is a colorless gas. But the problem says A1 is bright red. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the bright red substance is not XeF6 but something else. Alternatively, maybe Y is not a noble gas but another element whose higher fluoride is a strong oxidizer. For example, chlorine trifluoride (ClF3) is a strong oxidizer and is a colorless gas. Not helpful. Alternatively, maybe Y is iodine. Iodine pentafluoride (IF5) is a strong oxidizing agent and is a colorless liquid. Decomposes to IF3 and F2? Let's check. IF5 decomposes when heated: 2 IF5 → IF4 + F2. But IF4 is not a common compound. Also, the percentage of F in IF4 would be (4*19)/(126.9 + 76) = 76/202.9 ≈37.45%. Not sure if that's 31.96%. Alternatively, maybe A2 is IF3. Then, %F would be (3*19)/ (126.9 + 57) = 57/183.9 ≈31.00%, which is close to but less than 31.96%. Not exact. Alternatively, maybe Y is polonium. Polonium has a molar mass of 209, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a hypothetical element. Wait, but given that we need to find the molar mass of A4, perhaps I need to find another approach. Let's think about the other clues. A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y with F2. So, A3 could be YF_n. Also, A3 can interact with xenon. Then, adding Y (1:1) to a hot solution of A4 gives A5, which decomposes in water. Let's think of A4. If A4 is a fluoride of Y that can react with Y in a 1:1 ratio, perhaps A4 is YF, and when Y (excess or in certain conditions) is added, it forms YF2 (A5). But YF + Y → YF2. But in solution. Alternatively, A4 could be YF3, and adding Y would form YF2. For example, if A4 is YF3 and Y is elemental, then maybe 2 Y + 3 YF3 → 5 YF2 (balanced equation: 2 Y + 3 YF3 → 5 YF2). But 1:1 molar ratio. If A4 is YF2 and Y is added 1:1, then maybe Y + YF2 → Y2F2? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe A4 is YF, and adding Y in 1:1 ratio gives Y2F. But A5 would then be Y2F, which decomposes in water. Alternatively, considering the known chemistry, let's assume that Y is a metal. Let's suppose Y is iron. Iron forms several fluorides: FeF2 and FeF3. Wait, but five binary compounds might be difficult. Alternatively, Y could be an element with multiple oxidation states. Let's think of element Y as nitrogen. But nitrogen doesn't form five binary fluorides. Wait, perhaps Y is carbon? CF4, C2F6, etc., but they are gases. Alternatively, Y is boron. BCl3, but with fluorine: BF3, BCl3, etc. Not sure. Alternatively, think of the molar masses given in the options. For A4, possible molar mass ranges. The answer choices are 110-130, 140-160, etc. Suppose A4 is YF3. If Y's molar mass is ~121 (from previous calculation where A2 is YF3 with 31.96% F), then YF3 would have a molar mass of 121 + 57 = 178, which falls into option B) 160-180. But A4 could be another compound. But let's consider that A4 is YF3, then A4's molar mass is ~178, answer B. But the problem says that by adding Y (1:1 molar ratio) to A4, you get A5. If A4 is YF3 and you add Y in 1:1 ratio, then the reaction would be Y + YF3 → A5. If it's a 1:1 ratio, perhaps 3 Y + YF3 → 4 Y2F (not balanced). Alternatively, maybe YF3 + Y → 2 YF2 (if A5 is YF2). Balanced equation: YF3 + Y → YF2 (unbalanced). Let me balance: YF3 + Y → YF2. Stoichiometric coefficients: Let's say a YF3 + b Y → c YF2. Atoms: Y: a + b = c F: 3a = 2c. Let’s set a = 2: 6a=12,  Let's think in parallel.

<Conclusion>
The balanced reaction is 2 YF3 + Y → 3 YF2, indicating A5 is YF2 with a molar mass of M_Y + 38.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
But the problem states that A5 is obtained by adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to A4. So, for each mole of A4 (YF3), you add one mole of Y. According to the balanced equation, 2 moles of YF3 require 1 mole of Y to produce 3 moles of YF2. But that's a 2:1 ratio. If instead, the reaction is different, like YF3 + Y → 2 YF. But YF is ionic, maybe? Alternatively, maybe the reaction is different. Alternatively, if A4 is YF, then adding Y in 1:1 ratio would give Y2F (but unlikely). Alternatively, if A4 is YF2, adding Y in 1:1 ratio would give YF. Let's think. Wait, perhaps the reaction is a disproportionation reaction. For example, if A4 is YF, adding Y (which is element) could result in the formation of Y metal and YF2. But not sure. Alternatively, if A4 is YF3, adding Y would result in forming YF2. For example, YF3 + Y → YF2 + ..., but balancing the equation: Reactants: YF3 + Y Products: YF2. To balance: Coefficients. Let’s suppose a YF3 + b Y → c YF2. Y atoms: a + b = c F atoms: 3a = 2c From the first equation: c = a + b. Substituting into the second: 3a = 2(a + b). 3a = 2a + 2b. a = 2b. If b=1, then a=2. Then c = 2 +1=3. So the balanced equation is 2 YF3 + 1 Y → 3 YF2. But the problem states that A5 is formed by adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to A4. So this equation requires 2 moles of YF3 and 1 mole of Y, which is a 2:1 ratio, not 1:1. Therefore, this doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is different. Suppose A4 is YF, and A5 is Y2F2. Then, 2 Y + 2 YF → 4 YF (but that's not a real compound). Alternatively, maybe Y + YF → 2 YF (no change). Alternatively, maybe A4 is YF3 and A5 is YF4. But how? Y + YF3 → YF4. 1 mole + 1 mole → 1 mole. That would work in a 1:1 ratio. So YF3 + Y → YF4. Then A5 is YF4. But when A5 decomposes in water into two substances, perhaps producing hydrogen fluoride and another compound. For example, if YF4 hydrolyzes: YF4 + 2 H2O → Y(OH)2 + 2 HF (if Y forms a hydroxide). This could be a possible decomposition. Then, A5 would be YF4, which hydrolyzes into Y(OH)2 and HF. But the problem says two substances. If Y is a metal, then this makes sense. Then, A4 is YF3, which reacting with Y in 1:1 ratio gives YF4. But according to our previous calculation, if A4 is YF3, its molar mass would be ~178 (if Y's molar mass is ~121), which falls into option B) 160-180. But the answer options are A) 140-160, B) 160-180, C) 110-130, D) 220-240. If A4 is YF3, and Y has a molar mass of ~121, then YF3 would be ~178, which is in B. But let's check again. If A4 is YF3, then its molar mass is 121.37 (Y) + 3*19 = 121.37 + 57 = 178.37. So 178.37 is in option B) 160-180. But wait, earlier we considered that A2 is YF3 where Y has a molar mass of 121.37. Then A2 is YF3 (178.37). But the problem says that A1 decomposes into A2 and F2. If A1 is YF4, which upon decomposition gives YF3 (A2) and F2. But wait, if A1 is YF4, then decomposing into YF3 and F2: YF4 → YF3 + (1/2) F2. But the problem says A1 is bright red. If Y is element with molar mass ~121, then A1 would be YF4 with molar mass 121 + 4*19 = 121 + 76 = 197. Which is over 190. But A2 would be YF3 at 178.37. Then A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y with F2. Fluorinating Y (element) gives A3. If Y is 121, fluorinating Y would give A3 as YF_n. Since A3 can also interact with xenon, perhaps A3 is a strong oxidizer. If Y is a metal with molar mass ~121, like tin (118.7), then A3 could be SnF4, which is a known fluoride. SnF4 is a colorless solid, and does not oxidize xenon. Hmm. Alternatively, if Y is a noble gas, like krypton (83.80). But then A2 would be different. Wait, this is getting too convoluted. Let's switch gears. The problem says that A5 decomposes into two substances when added to water. If A5 is YF4, then in water it could hydrolyze into Y(OH)2 and HF, as mentioned before. If Y forms a +4 oxide, then Y(OH)2 would be the hydroxide. Another possibility is that A5 is a fluoride like XeF4. XeF4 hydrolyzes in water to form XeO3 and Xe, but that might not be two substances. Alternatively, if A5 is XeF2, which hydrolyzes into Xe and XeO3 or something else. Not sure. Alternatively, if A5 is a metal fluoride. For example, BeF2 hydrolyzes into Be(OH)2<Conclusion>

let's think in parallel.

1: analyze the decomposition of a1 into a2 and f2, and the oxidation of xe by a1 and a3.

2: analyze the synthesis of a5 from y and a4, and its decomposition in water.

1: let's go through the problem step by step. first, the problem mentions that a1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 k into a2 (which has a fluoride content ωf = 31.96%) and fluorine. also, a1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. then a3 can interact with xenon as well and is obtained by fluorinating element y with fluorine. adding y in a 1:1 molar ratio to hot, colorless, concentrated a4 solution gives a5. a5 decomposes in water to form two substances. need to find the molar mass of a4.
let's think in parallel.

1.1: determine the identity of element y based on its ability to oxidize xe.

1.2: determine the identity of element y based on its ability to form a3 through fluorination.

1.1: first, figuring out what element y is. since a1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. xenon is normally inert, but if a1 can oxidize it, a1 must be a strong oxidizing agent. fluorine is the strongest oxidizing agent, so compounds of f with high oxidation states might be strong oxidizers. also, element y must be able to form multiple binary compounds with fluorine. binary compounds of fluorine with element y—so y must be a metal or nonmetal that can form multiple fluorides.
</path>
<path>
1.2: second, a3 is formed by fluorinating element y with fluorine. so y must be a metal that can form fluorides. given that y can form multiple binary compounds with f, likely a metal from the first few groups (like group 1, 2, maybe 13 or 14 states). but considering a1 oxidizes xe, which is a noble gas, this suggests a1 is a strong oxidizing agent. xenon is inert, but under certain conditions can be oxidized by strong oxidizers like f2 or perhaps other highly oxidizing fluorides. the fact that a1 can oxidize xe implies a1 is a powerful oxidizer, possibly a fluoride of a metal in a high oxidation state. alternatively, since a3 can also interact with xe, maybe a3 is another fluoride of y that can react with xe, perhaps under different conditions. the element y must therefore be one that forms fluorides capable of oxidizing xe. this might narrow down the possibilities.
</path>
<conclusion>
the element y is likely a metal capable of high oxidation states, such as those found in groups 1, 2, 13, or 14. the ability of a1 to oxidize xe implies y is a strong oxidizer, possibly in a high oxidation state. y is also capable of forming multiple fluorides, including a3, which can react with xe.

2: then, adding y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot solution of a4 gives a5. a5 decomposes in water into two substances. so, a4 is a compound of y and f, probably. let's think step by step. first, element y. what element is y? the key here is probably xenon. the problem mentions that a1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. xenon is inert, but under certain conditions, like with strong oxidizers, it can form compounds. the first noble gas compound was xenon hexafluoride. so maybe y is xenon? let's check. if y is xenon, its binary compounds with fluorine would be xef2, xef4, xef6, etc. wait, but there are five compounds here. wait, the problem says five binary compounds of fluorine with element y are known. so y could be another element that forms multiple fluorides. alternatively, maybe y is another element, but the fact that a1 oxidizes xenon suggests that a1 is a strong oxidizing agent. known strong oxidizing agents involving fluorine include things like oxygen difluoride (of2), but more likely, something like xenon difluoride or another xenon fluoride. wait, but if y is xenon, then the compounds could be xef2, xef4, xef6, etc. but there are five of them. wait, actually, xenon forms several fluorides: xef2, xef4, xef6, and also xef3^+ related compounds, but i'm not sure if there are five established ones. alternatively, maybe y is not xenon but another element that forms multiple fluorides, and the interaction with xenon is through some redox reaction. wait, the problem states that a1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. so a1 must be a strong oxidizing agent. let's consider possible fluorides that are strong oxidizers. for example, clf3 is a strong oxidizing agent, but that's chlorine, not a noble gas. if y is a noble gas, like xenon, then xef6 is a known strong oxidizing agent. but xef6 is a gas at room temperature. the problem says a1 is a bright-red substance. so, xef6 is a colorless gas. hmm, that might not match. what about xef4? the colors of xenon fluorides: xef2 is a pale yellow liquid, xef4 is a yellow crystalline solid, xef6 is a colorless gas. wait, but maybe the bright-red substance is a different compound. alternatively, maybe y is not xenon but another element. let's think of other elements that form multiple fluorides. for example, sulfur forms sf2, s2f2, sf4, sf6, but how many? alternatively, phosphorus or arsenic. wait, but the interaction with xenon might be a key here. if a1 oxidizes xenon, which is inert, a1 must be a powerful oxidizer. the most common powerful oxidizers involving fluorine are probably oxygen difluoride (of2), but that's a gas. then there's sulfur tetrafluoride (sf4), but it's not a strong oxidizer. xenon hexafluoride (xef6) is a strong oxidizing agent. wait, but xef6 is a colorless gas. wait, the problem says a1 decomposes at 293 k into a2 (ωf = 31.96%) and fluorine. the omega f is the mass percentage of fluorine in a2. so, if a2 has 31.96% f by mass, we can use that to find its formula. let me calculate. suppose a2 is a compound of y and f. let the molar mass of y be m. then, the formula would be yf_n. the mass percentage of f is (n * 19) / (m + 19n) = 31.96%. so, (n * 19) / (m + 19n) = 0.3196. rearranging, 19n = 0.3196 (m + 19n). 19n = 0.3196m + 6.0724n. subtract 6.0724n from both sides: 19n - 6.0724n = 0.3196m. 12.9276n = 0.3196m. therefore, m = (12.9276 / 0.3196) * n. calculating the coefficient: 12.9276 / 0.3196 ≈ 40.5. so, m ≈ 40.5n. since m is the molar mass of element y, which has to be a whole number (approximately), and n is an integer (number of f atoms per y atom), possible values: if n=1, m≈40.5 → element with molar mass ~40.5. that would be potassium (39), but kf would be k (39) + f (19) = 58. 19/58 ≈ 32.75%, which isn't 31.96%. hmm. if n=2, m≈81. for yf2: y's molar mass ≈81. could be rubidium (85.47), but that's close. let's check: rbf2. rb is 85.47, f is 19. so, total molar mass = 85.47 + 2*19 = 85.47 + 38 = 123.47. %f = (38 / 123.47) * 100 ≈ 30.82%. close to 31.96%, but a bit lower. if n=2, and m≈81. if y has a molar mass of 81, then compound yf2: molar mass = 81 + 38 = 119. %f = 38/119 *100 ≈ 31.93%, which is 31.96%, close enough considering rounding. so, y has a molar mass of approximately 81. what element has a molar mass around 81? mercury is 200. wait, wait: 81 is close to bromine (80), but bromine is 80, y can't be bromine (non-metal). alternatively, rb is 85.47, which we saw before. wait, maybe there's another element. wait, let's check molybdenum (mo, 95.95), too high. wait, gallium is 69.72, too low. wait, maybe y isn't a metal but another type of element. wait, but y is reacting with fluorine, so likely a metal. wait, perhaps it's not a metal; maybe a metalloid? wait, but noble gases also form compounds with fluorine, but they aren't metals. wait, if y is a noble gas, like xenon, its molar mass is 131. wait, but 81 is too low. alternatively, perhaps y is an element with molar mass 81. let's check the periodic table. element with atomic weight approximately 81: bromine is 79.904, krypton is 83.798, ruthenium is 101.07, not really. wait, maybe indium? in is 114.82, nope. wait, maybe this approach is wrong. let me check the calculation again. given that the percentage of fluorine in a2 is 31.96%, and a2 is yf_n. so, (n * 19) / (m + 19n) = 0.3196. rearranging gives m = (12.9276 / 0.3196) * n ≈ 40.5n. so for n=1, m≈40.5, which would be potassium (39), but as we saw, kf would have 39% f, which is 19/(39+19)≈33.3%, which is higher than 31.96%. for n=2, m≈81. so y would have a molar mass of 81. as there is no element with molar mass 81, perhaps the calculation is approximate. the closest element to 81 is bromine (79.9), but it's a halogen and would not form a compound like yf2. alternatively, maybe y is not a single element but a mix? no, the problem states it's an element y. alternatively, maybe the percentage is not exactly 31.96%, but given the answer choices, perhaps we can proceed with this approximation. alternatively, maybe a2 is not yf_n but a different stoichiometry. wait, perhaps i made a mistake in the formula. if a2 is yf_n, then the percentage of f is (n*19)/(m_y + n*19) = 31.96%. so, solving for m_y: (n*19) = 0.3196*(m_y + 19n) => n*19 = 0.3196*m_y + 0.3196*19n => n*19 - 0.3196*19n = 0.3196*m_y => 19n*(1 - 0.3196) = 0.3196*m_y => 19n*0.6804 = 0.3196*m_y => m_y = (19n*0.6804)/0.3196 ≈ (19n*2.128) ≈ 40.43n. so m_y ≈ 40.43n. so for n=1, m_y ≈40.43 (potassium is 39), for n=2, m_y≈80.86. if y is rb (85.47), that's close to 80.86, but rbf2's molar mass would be 85.47 + 38 = 123.47, and %f is 38/123.47≈30.82%, which is lower than 31.96%. alternatively, if y has a molar mass of 81, then yf2's molar mass is 81 + 38=119, and 38/119≈31.93%, which is very close to 31.96%. so y's molar mass would be approximately 81. but which element is that? looking at the periodic table: - argon: 40, not 81. - chlorine: 35.5, - sulfur: 32. - phosphorus: 31. none near 81. wait, krypton is 83.8, but it's a noble gas. wait, could y be krypton? if y is krypton (83.80), then yf2 would have molar mass 83.80 + 38 = 121.80. %f is 38 / 121.80 *100≈31.20%, still lower than 31.96%. alternatively, bromine is 79.90, but it's a halogen. brf2 would be 79.9 + 38 = 117.9. %f = 38 / 117.9 *100≈32.22%, higher than 31.96%. not a good match. wait, maybe the formula is different. maybe a2 is yf3. let's check. if a2 is yf3, then: %f = (3*19)/(m + 3*19) = 57/(m + 57) = 0.3196. so, 57 = 0.3196*(m + 57). then, 57 = 0.3196m + 18.2. subtract 18.2: 38.8 = 0.3196m. thus, m ≈ 38.8 / 0.3196 ≈ 121.4. so y would have a molar mass of ~121. that's indium (114.8), silver (107.87), but none close. tin is 118.7, close. let's check: if y is tin (118.7), then snf3 would have molar mass 118.7 + 57 = 175.7. %f = 57/175.7 *100 ≈32.49%, which is higher than 31.96%. alternatively, y with molar mass 121.4, compound yf3: molar mass 121.4 +57=178.4. %f=57/178.4*100≈31.94%, very close to 31.96%. so a2 could be yf3 where y has a molar mass of ~121.4. then y would be an element with molar mass ~121.4. the closest is tin (118.7) or indium (114.8), but neither fits exactly. alternatively, maybe the element is not from the periodic table, but that's impossible. wait, perhaps my assumption of the formula is wrong. alternatively, maybe a2 is y2f. wait, but that would be unlikely. alternatively, maybe the formula is different. wait, perhaps a2 is yf. let me check. if a2 is yf: 19/(m + 19) = 0.3196. so, 19 = 0.3196*(m + 19). then, 19 = 0.3196m + 6.0724. subtract: 12.9276 = 0.3196m. so, m ≈ 40.3. which would be potassium (39), but yf would be kf, molar mass 58.09, %f 32.7%, which is higher than 31.96%. alternatively, if y is calcium (40.08), caf would have molar mass 40.08 + 19 = 59.08, %f =19/59.08≈32.17%, still higher. not a good fit. alternatively, maybe the formula is yf4. let's check. (4*19)/(m + 76) = 0.3196. 76 = 0.3196*(m +76). 76 = 0.3196m +24.27. subtract: 51.73 =0.3196m. m≈162. so y would be an element with molar mass ~162. that's osmium (190.23), too high. not helpful. alternatively, perhaps the formula is yf5. wait, but this is getting tedious. let's think differently. the problem says a1 decomposes into a2 and fluorine. so, a1 could be yf_m, which upon decomposition gives yf_n (a2) and f2. for example, if a1 is xef6, which upon heating might decompose into xef4 (a2) and f2. but xef6 is a gas, but the problem says a1 is a bright-red substance. alternatively, maybe a1 is a different compound. wait, another approach: if a1 is a higher fluoride of y that decomposes to a lower fluoride (a2) and f2. for example, yf6 → yf4 + f2. if that's the case, and a2 is yf4, which has 31.96% f. let's check that. if a2 is yf4, then: %f = (4*19)/(m + 76) = 76/(m + 76) = 0.3196. so, 76 = 0.3196*(m +76). then, 76 = 0.3196m +24.27. subtract 24.27 from both sides: 51.73 =0.3196m. therefore, m=51.73/0.3196≈162.2. so, the molar mass of y is ~162.2. which element has a molar mass around 162? osmium is 190, tungsten is 183.84, gold is 197, not really. wait, element with molar mass ~162: there's none. the closest is platinum (195.08), too high. hmm. alternatively, maybe a2 is yf3. let's check that again. if a2 is yf3, then: 57/(m +57) =0.3196. solving as before: 57 =0.3196*(m +57); 57 =0.3196m +18.22; 57 -18.22=0.3196m; 38.78=0.3196m; m≈121.37. so y would have molar mass ~121.37. tin is 118.7, close. let's check: if y is tin, then yf3 is snf3. sn (118.7) + 3*19 (57) =175.7. %f=57/175.7≈32.49%, higher than 31.96%. alternatively, if y has molar mass 121.37, then yf3 would have molar mass 121.37 +57=178.37. %f=57/178.37≈31.95%, which is very close to 31.96%. so, y has a molar mass of ~121.37. the closest element is tin (118.7), which is 118.7, so snf3 would have a slightly higher %f, but maybe in a different oxidation state or if y is not a real element, but since we have to proceed, maybe y is tin. but wait, if y is tin, then a1 decomposes into snf3 and f2. but a1 oxidizes xenon. snf3 isn't a known oxidizer of xenon. alternatively, perhaps y is lead. pb has a molar mass of 207.2, which is higher. hmm. alternatively, maybe y is not a metal but a metalloid. wait, but this is getting confusing. let's think of the initial problem again. the key points are: 1. a1 is bright red, decomposes at 293 k (20°c, room temperature) into a2 (31.96% f) and f2. 2. a1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. 3. a3 is obtained by fluorinating element y with f2. 4. a5 is formed by adding y (1:1 molar ratio) to a hot solution of a4. 5. a5 decomposes in water into two substances. the compounds are five binary compounds of y and f. let's think of noble gases again. if y is a noble gas, like xenon, then the known fluorides are xef2, xef4, xef6. but if a1 oxidizes xenon, and is a noble gas fluoride, then perhaps a1 is xef6, which is a strong oxidizing agent. but xef6 is a colorless gas. the problem states a1 is bright red. hmm. alternatively, maybe y is another element. wait, let's think of oxygen fluorides. oxygen difluoride (of2) is a gas, not bright red. sulfur hexafluoride (sf6) is a gas, but sulfur also forms sf4 and s2f10. wait, but sulfur is a possible element y. let's check. if y is sulfur. the binary fluorides of sulfur are s2f10, sf6, sf4, etc. let's see: if a1 is s2f10 (decomposes to sf6 and f2?), but s2f10 is a colorless gas. alternatively, maybe a1 is sf6, which decomposes into sf4 and f2. let's check: sf6 → sf4 + f2. the stoichiometry would be sf6 → sf4 + f2. if a2 is sf4, then the mass % of f in sf4 is (4*19)/ (32 + 76) = 76/108 ≈0.7037, i.e., 70.37% f, which doesn't match 31.96%. not helpful. alternatively, maybe y is a metal. let's think of metals that form multiple fluorides. for example, boron trifluoride (bf3) but boron isn't a metal. wait, perhaps element y is chlorine? no, chlorine forms several interhalogen compounds, but chlorine itself isn't a metal. wait, let's re-examine the fact that a1 oxidizes xenon. xenon is inert, but under certain conditions can be oxidized. for example, by strong oxidizing agents like f2, but also by higher fluorides. if y is a noble gas, like xenon, then xef6 is a known strong oxidizing agent. xef6 is a colorless gas. but the problem says a1 is bright red. hmm. wait, perhaps the bright red substance is not xef6 but something else. alternatively, maybe y is not a noble gas but another element whose higher fluoride is a strong oxidizer. for example, chlorine trifluoride (clf3) is a strong oxidizer and is a colorless gas. not helpful. alternatively, maybe y is iodine. iodine pentafluoride (if5) is a strong oxidizing agent and is a colorless liquid. decomposes to if3 and f2? let's check. if5 decomposes when heated: 2 if5 → if4 + f2. but if4 is not a common compound. also, the percentage of f in if4 would be (4*19)/(126.9 + 76) = 76/202.9 ≈37.45%. not sure if that's 31.96%. alternatively, maybe a2 is if3. then, %f would be (3*19)/ (126.9 + 57) = 57/183.9 ≈31.00%, which is close to but less than 31.96%. not exact. alternatively, maybe y is polonium. polonium has a molar mass of 209, but i'm not sure. alternatively, perhaps y is a hypothetical element. wait, but given that we need to find the molar mass of a4, perhaps i need to find another approach. let's think about the other clues. a3 is obtained by fluorinating y with f2. so, a3 could be yf_n. also, a3 can interact with xenon. then, adding y (1:1) to a hot solution of a4 gives a5, which decomposes in water. let's think of a4. if a4 is a fluoride of y that can react with y in a 1:1 ratio, perhaps a4 is yf, and when y (excess or in certain conditions) is added, it forms yf2 (a5). but yf + y → yf2. but in solution. alternatively, a4 could be yf3, and adding y would form yf2. for example, if a4 is yf3 and y is elemental, then maybe 2 y + 3 yf3 → 5 yf2 (balanced equation: 2 y + 3 yf3 → 5 yf2). but 1:1 molar ratio. if a4 is yf2 and y is added 1:1, then maybe y + yf2 → y2f2? not sure. alternatively, maybe a4 is yf, and adding y in 1:1 ratio gives y2f. but a5 would then be y2f, which decomposes in water. alternatively, considering the known chemistry, let's assume that y is a metal. let's suppose y is iron. iron forms several fluorides: fef2 and fef3. wait, but five binary compounds might be difficult. alternatively, y could be an element with multiple oxidation states. let's think of element y as nitrogen. but nitrogen doesn't form five binary fluorides. wait, perhaps y is carbon? cf4, c2f6, etc., but they are gases. alternatively, y is boron. bcl3, but with fluorine: bf3, bcl3, etc. not sure. alternatively, think of the molar masses given in the options. for a4, possible molar mass ranges. the answer choices are 110-130, 140-160, etc. suppose a4 is yf3. if y's molar mass is ~121 (from previous calculation where a2 is yf3 with 31.96% f), then yf3 would have a molar mass of 121 + 57 = 178, which falls into option b) 160-180. but a4 could be another compound. but let's consider that a4 is yf3, then a4's molar mass is ~178, answer b. but the problem says that by adding y (1:1 molar ratio) to a4, you get a5. if a4 is yf3 and you add y in 1:1 ratio, then the reaction would be y + yf3 → a5. if it's a 1:1 ratio, perhaps 3 y + yf3 → 4 y2f (not balanced). alternatively, maybe yf3 + y → 2 yf2 (if a5 is yf2). balanced equation: yf3 + y → yf2 (unbalanced). let me balance: yf3 + y → yf2. stoichiometric coefficients: let's say a yf3 + b y → c yf2. atoms: y: a + b = c f: 3a = 2c. let’s set a = 2: 6a=12,  let's think in parallel.

but the problem states that a5 is obtained by adding y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a4. so, for each mole of a4 (yf3), you add one mole of y. according to the balanced equation, 2 moles of yf3 require 1 mole of y to produce 3 moles of yf2. but that's a 2:1 ratio. if instead, the reaction is different, like yf3 + y → 2 yf. but yf is ionic, maybe? alternatively, maybe the reaction is different. alternatively, if a4 is yf, then adding y in 1:1 ratio would give y2f (but unlikely). alternatively, if a4 is yf2, adding y in 1:1 ratio would give yf. let's think. wait, perhaps the reaction is a disproportionation reaction. for example, if a4 is yf, adding y (which is element) could result in the formation of y metal and yf2. but not sure. alternatively, if a4 is yf3, adding y would result in forming yf2. for example, yf3 + y → yf2 + ..., but balancing the equation: reactants: yf3 + y products: yf2. to balance: coefficients. let’s suppose a yf3 + b y → c yf2. y atoms: a + b = c f atoms: 3a = 2c from the first equation: c = a + b. substituting into the second: 3a = 2(a + b). 3a = 2a + 2b. a = 2b. if b=1, then a=2. then c = 2 +1=3. so the balanced equation is 2 yf3 + 1 y → 3 yf2. but the problem states that a5 is formed by adding y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a4. so this equation requires 2 moles of yf3 and 1 mole of y, which is a 2:1 ratio, not 1:1. therefore, this doesn't fit. alternatively, maybe the reaction is different. suppose a4 is yf, and a5 is y2f2. then, 2 y + 2 yf → 4 yf (but that's not a real compound). alternatively, maybe y + yf → 2 yf (no change). alternatively, maybe a4 is yf3 and a5 is yf4. but how? y + yf3 → yf4. 1 mole + 1 mole → 1 mole. that would work in a 1:1 ratio. so yf3 + y → yf4. then a5 is yf4. but when a5 decomposes in water into two substances, perhaps producing hydrogen fluoride and another compound. for example, if yf4 hydrolyzes: yf4 + 2 h2o → y(oh)2 + 2 hf (if y forms a hydroxide). this could be a possible decomposition. then, a5 would be yf4, which hydrolyzes into y(oh)2 and hf. but the problem says two substances. if y is a metal, then this makes sense. then, a4 is yf3, which reacting with y in 1:1 ratio gives yf4. but according to our previous calculation, if a4 is yf3, its molar mass would be ~178 (if y's molar mass is ~121), which falls into option b) 160-180. but the answer options are a) 140-160, b) 160-180, c) 110-130, d) 220-240. if a4 is yf3, and y has a molar mass of ~121, then yf3 would be ~178, which is in b. but let's check again. if a4 is yf3, then its molar mass is 121.37 (y) + 3*19 = 121.37 + 57 = 178.37. so 178.37 is in option b) 160-180. but wait, earlier we considered that a2 is yf3 where y has a molar mass of 121.37. then a2 is yf3 (178.37). but the problem says that a1 decomposes into a2 and f2. if a1 is yf4, which upon decomposition gives yf3 (a2) and f2. but wait, if a1 is yf4, then decomposing into yf3 and f2: yf4 → yf3 + (1/2) f2. but the problem says a1 is bright red. if y is element with molar mass ~121, then a1 would be yf4 with molar mass 121 + 4*19 = 121 + 76 = 197. which is over 190. but a2 would be yf3 at 178.37. then a3 is obtained by fluorinating y with f2. fluorinating y (element) gives a3. if y is 121, fluorinating y would give a3 as yf_n. since a3 can also interact with xenon, perhaps a3 is a strong oxidizer. if y is a metal with molar mass ~121, like tin (118.7), then a3 could be snf4, which is a known fluoride. snf4 is a colorless solid, and does not oxidize xenon. hmm. alternatively, if y is a noble gas, like krypton (83.80). but then a2 would be different. wait, this is getting too convoluted. let's switch gears. the problem says that a5 decomposes into two substances when added to water. if a5 is yf4, then in water it could hydrolyze into y(oh)2 and hf, as mentioned before. if y forms a +4 oxide, then y(oh)2 would be the hydroxide. another possibility is that a5 is a fluoride like xef4. xef4 hydrolyzes in water to form xeo3 and xe, but that might not be two substances. alternatively, if a5 is xef2, which hydrolyzes into xe and xeo3 or something else. not sure. alternatively, if a5 is a metal fluoride. for example, bef2 hydrolyzes into be(oh)2<conclusion>
