Okay, let's try to solve this problem step by step.
The question is about an electron and a positron colliding and annihilating into two photons.
We need to find the angle between the directions of the photons.
The given options are A) 172°, B) 96°, C) 74°, and D) 138°.
First, let's recall some basic concepts.
The Lorentz factor (gamma) is given for both particles.
The electron has a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron has a Lorentz factor of 2.
Since they are moving towards each other along the horizontal axis, their velocities are in opposite directions.
The fact that they annihilate into two photons of equal energy suggests that energy and momentum must be conserved in the process.
Let's think in parallel.

2: Identification of the photon momentum-energy relationship.

<Path>
2: The momentum (p) of a photon is related to its energy (E) by the equation p = E/c.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The equality of photon energies signifies equal momentum magnitudes, and photons possess momentum (p) related to their energy (E) by the formula p = E/c.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So, if the photons are emitted at angles θ1 and θ2 from the horizontal axis, then the components of their momenta must add up to the total momentum of the incoming electron and positron.
Wait, the problem states that one photon is moving in the upper-right direction and the other in the lower-right direction.
So, the angles of the photons with respect to the horizontal axis would be θ and -θ, but since they are upper-right and lower-right, maybe the angles are symmetric about the horizontal axis.
So the angle between them would be 2θ.
But I need to check this visualization.
But the angle between the two photons is the angle between their direction vectors.
If one is upper-right and the other is lower-right, then the angle between them would be 180° - (θ + θ) = 180° - 2θ, but if they are on opposite sides, maybe.
Wait, perhaps upper-right and lower-right mean that both are above and below the horizontal axis on the right side.
So the angle between them would be the angle between upper-right and lower-right.
Let's say the horizontal axis is the x-axis, upper-right would be in the first quadrant, lower-right in the fourth quadrant.
The angle between those two directions would be 180° minus twice the angle each makes with the horizontal.
Wait, maybe the angle between upper-right (say 45° above horizontal) and lower-right (45° below horizontal) would be 90° + 90° - the overlap, no.
Wait, angle between two vectors can be found by the difference in their angles.
If one is θ above the horizontal and the other is θ below the horizontal, then the angle between them is 2θ.
Wait, let me draw a quick diagram.
Suppose the horizontal axis is left to right.
The electron is coming from the left (negative x-direction) and the positron from the right (positive x-direction).
After collision, a photon goes upper-right, which would be upper quadrant relative to the horizontal, and the other goes lower-right, lower quadrant relative to the horizontal.
So if upper-right is angle θ above the horizontal, and lower-right is angle θ below the horizontal, then the angle between the two photons is θ + θ = 2θ.
Wait, but angle between two directions is the smallest angle between them.
If one is θ above horizontal and the other is θ below, then the angle between them is 2θ.
But if θ is measured from the horizontal, then that makes sense.
For example, if θ is 30°, then the angle between upper 30° and lower 30° is 60°.
So in this problem, we need to compute 2θ where θ is the angle each photon makes with the horizontal axis.
But maybe not.
Let me confirm.
The angle between two vectors can be calculated using the dot product.
If the two photons are emitted at angles θ and -θ from the horizontal, then their direction vectors are (cosθ, sinθ) and (cos(-θ), sin(-θ)) = (cosθ, -sinθ).
The dot product is cosθ*cosθ + sinθ*(-sinθ) = cos2θ - sin2θ = cos(2θ).
The angle between them is arccos(cos(2θ)) = 2θ.
So yes, if each photon is emitted at angle θ from the horizontal in opposite vertical directions, the angle between them is 2θ.
But in this case, both are on the same side of the horizontal axis?
Wait, upper-right and lower-right.
Let me visualize.
If the electron is coming from the left, the positron from the right, after collision, momentum needs to be conserved.
The total momentum before collision must equal the total momentum after collision.
The total momentum before collision is the vector sum of the electron's and positron's momenta.
Since they are moving along the horizontal axis, their momenta are along the x-axis.
Electron's momentum is in the negative x-direction (since it's moving left to right, but momentum is mγv, and velocity is positive if moving to the right.
Wait, maybe we need to clarify.
Wait, the Lorentz factor is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).
The electron is moving from the left with gamma = 4.
Let's take the positive x-direction as right.
So velocity of electron is to the right (i.e., positive x-direction) with speed v_e such that gamma_e = 4.
The positron is moving from the right with gamma_p = 2, so velocity is to the left (negative x-direction) with speed v_p such that gamma_p = 2.
Therefore, the total momentum before collision is:
Let's think in parallel.

</Path>
<Path>
2: The momentum of the positron (p_p) is expressed as its rest mass (m) multiplied by its Lorentz factor (γ_p) and its velocity (v_p). The positron's velocity (v_p) is directed to the left, corresponding to a negative x-component (-v_p), while its Lorentz factor (γ_p) is 2. Consequently, the positron's momentum (p_p) is -γ_p m v_p.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The electron's momentum is p_e = γ_e m v_e, and the positron's momentum is p_p = -γ_p m v_p, where velocities are considered with respect to the positive x-axis.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
But since the positron is moving to the left, its velocity is negative.
Therefore, the total momentum is p_e + p_p = γ_e m v_e - γ_p m v_p.
Wait, but we need to relate v_e and v_p to their respective gamma factors.
Since gamma_e = 4 and gamma_p = 2.
We know that gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)), so v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2).
Therefore, for the electron, v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) = c * sqrt(15/16) = (c * sqrt(15))/4.
Similarly, for the positron, v_p = c * sqrt(1 - 1/4) = c * sqrt(3/4) = (c * sqrt(3))/2.
Therefore, plugging into total momentum:
p_total = γ_e m v_e - γ_p m v_p
= 4m * (c sqrt(15)/4) - 2m * (c sqrt(3)/2)
= m c sqrt(15) - m c sqrt(3)
= m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))
Hmm, so the total momentum is in the positive x-direction (since electron's momentum is larger)?
Wait, but the electron is moving to the right (positive x) with higher gamma (so higher momentum), and positron is moving to the left with lower gamma.
Therefore, the total momentum is indeed in the positive x-direction.
But after annihilation, two photons are produced moving in upper-right and lower-right directions.
So their momenta must add up to the total momentum before collision (m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))) in the horizontal direction.
Since photons move at the speed of light, their energy E is related to momentum p by E = pc.
Since the energies of both photons are the same, their momenta must also be the same in magnitude.
Let their common momentum be p.
Then, the horizontal components of their momenta must add up to the total momentum, and the vertical components must cancel each other (since there was no initial vertical momentum).
Therefore, if the angle between each photon's direction and the horizontal axis is θ (upper-right) and -θ (lower-right), then:
Horizontal momentum conservation:
p * cosθ + p * cos(-θ) = 2p cosθ = total horizontal momentum (m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)))
Vertical momentum conservation:
p * sinθ + p * sin(-θ) = 0, which is automatically satisfied since sin(-θ) = -sinθ.
So, vertical components cancel, which is good since there was no initial vertical momentum.
So from horizontal momentum:
2p cosθ = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))  -- (1)
Also, energy conservation.
The total energy before collision must equal the total energy after collision.
The total energy before collision is the sum of the relativistic energies of the electron and positron.
Relativistic energy is gamma mc^2.
So:
E_total_before = γ_e mc^2 + γ_p mc^2 = 4 mc^2 + 2 mc^2 = 6 mc^2
After collision, the energy is converted into two photons each of energy E.
Since energies are the same, each photon has energy E.
So:
2E = 6 mc^2 => E = 3 mc^2
But for photons, E = pc.
Therefore, momentum p of each photon is E/c = 3 mc^2 / c = 3 m c.
So p = 3 m c.
Wait, that's helpful.
So each photon has momentum p = 3 m c.
Now, going back to equation (1):
2p cosθ = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))
Substituting p = 3 m c:
2*(3 m c)*cosθ = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))
Simplify:
6 m c cosθ = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))
Divide both sides by m c:
6 cosθ = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)
Therefore:
cosθ = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6
Now, compute the numerical value.
First, calculate sqrt(15) and sqrt(3).
sqrt(15) ≈ 3.872
sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732
Therefore, sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 3.872 - 1.732 ≈ 2.14
So cosθ ≈ 2.14 / 6 ≈ 0.3567
Then, θ ≈ arccos(0.3567)
Let's think in parallel.

2: A linear approximation is used for the cosine function near π/3 (60°) where cos(π/3) = 0.5. The derivative of cosθ is -sinθ. The slope at θ=π/3 is -sin(π/3) ≈ -√3/2 ≈ -0.866. The change in θ (Δθ) is given by Δθ ≈ (Δcosθ)/slope ≈ (0.5 - 0.3567)/0.866 ≈ 0.1433/0.866 ≈ 0.1655 radians. The angle θ is therefore estimated as π/3 + 0.1655 ≈ 1.2217 + 0.1655 ≈ 1.3872 radians. This is approximately 1.3872 * (180/π) ≈ 1.3872 * 57.2958 ≈ 79.3°, which is a rough estimate.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The angle θ was calculated to be approximately 69.2 degrees using a calculator and was estimated to be around 79 degrees using a linear approximation based on cos(π/3)=0.5.

Wait, but let's compute it more accurately.
Wait, 0.3567.
Let me check arccos(0.35):
Tables show that cos(69.5°) ≈ 0.358, cos(70°) ≈ 0.342.
Wait, 0.3567 is between cos(69.5°) and cos(70°), but closer to 69.5°.
Maybe around 69.7°?
Alternatively, use calculator:
arccos(0.3567) ≈ 69.2 degrees.
So θ ≈ 69.2°.
Therefore, the angle between the two photons is 2θ ≈ 138.4°.
Looking at the options, D) 138° is the closest.
So is this correct?
Wait, let's check again.
Wait, but why is the total momentum in the x-direction positive (to the right), but the angle θ is such that the photons are emitted at 69.2° from the horizontal (upper and lower right).
Then the angle between them is 138.4°.
But how does this relate to the total momentum?
Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake here.
Wait, let's verify the calculations step by step.
1. Total momentum before collision:
Electron: moving to the right (positive x), gamma = 4.
So velocity v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) = c * sqrt(15/16) = (c sqrt(15))/4 ≈ 0.965 c.
Momentum of electron: gamma m v_e = 4 m * (c sqrt(15)/4) = m c sqrt(15).
Positron: moving to the left (negative x), gamma = 2.
So velocity v_p = -c * sqrt(1 - 1/4) = -c * sqrt(3/4) = -c sqrt(3)/2 ≈ -0.866 c.
Momentum of positron: gamma m |v_p| * direction.
So since it's moving to the left, momentum is negative: 2 m * (c sqrt(3)/2) = m c sqrt(3) in the negative x-direction.
Therefore, total momentum is m c sqrt(15) - m c sqrt(3) = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) in the positive x-direction.
Correct.
2. Energy before collision: 4 mc^2 + 2 mc^2 = 6 mc^2.
After collision, two photons each with energy E.
So 2E = 6 mc^2 => E = 3 mc^2.
Therefore, momentum of each photon p = E/c = 3 mc^2 / c = 3 m c.
3. Momentum conservation in x-direction: 2 * p cosθ = total momentum.
So 2 * 3 m c * cosθ = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).
Canceling m c on both sides:
6 cosθ = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)
=> cosθ = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6 ≈ (3.872 - 1.732) / 6 ≈ 2.14 / 6 ≈ 0.3567
θ ≈ arccos(0.3567) ≈ 69.2 degrees.
Therefore, the angle between the two photons is 2θ ≈ 138.4 degrees.
The answer is D) 138 degrees.
But wait, let me check if I made any mistake in the direction of velocities or momenta.
Electron moving from left to right (positive x-direction) with gamma = 4.
Positron moving from right to left (negative x-direction) with gamma = 2.
Therefore, the total momentum is p_e + (-p_p) = gamma_e m v_e - gamma_p m v_p.
But v_e is positive (as velocity is in positive x-direction), v_p is negative (so -p_p becomes positive because p_p = gamma m |v| and direction is negative x, so momentum is -gamma_p m v_p, but here in magnitudes, we have p_p = gamma_p m |v_p|.
Wait, perhaps I need to clarify.
Wait, momentum is a vector.
So if the positron is moving to the left, its velocity v_p is negative.
Thus, the positron's momentum is p_p = gamma_p m v_p (since momentum is m gamma v), which would be negative.
Therefore, total momentum is p_e + p_p = gamma_e m v_e + gamma_p m v_p (since v_p is negative).
But when we computed the magnitude earlier:
gamma_e m |v_e| + gamma_p m |v_p| but with signs.
Wait, but when calculating the magnitude, do we need to take into account the direction?
Wait, perhaps I confused the magnitudes.
Wait, no.
Let me re-express.
The electron's momentum is in the positive x-direction: p_e = gamma_e m |v_e|.
The positron's momentum is in the negative x-direction: p_p = gamma_p m |v_p|.
Therefore, total momentum is p_e - p_p = gamma_e m |v_e| - gamma_p m |v_p|.
So maybe that's the correct expression.
Wait, but |v_e| and |v_p| can be calculated from their respective gamma factors.
So let's recalculate:
For electron:
gamma_e = 4 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v_e^2/c^2))
=> v_e^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/16 = 15/16
=> v_e = (sqrt(15)/4) c ≈ 0.965 c (positive x-direction)
For positron:
gamma_p = 2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v_p^2/c^2))
=> v_p^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4
=> v_p = (sqrt(3)/2) c ≈ 0.866 c (but since it's moving to the left, velocity is negative.
But when calculating |v_p|, it's sqrt(3)/2 c.
Therefore, total momentum:
gamma_e m |v_e| - gamma_p m |v_p| = 4m*(sqrt(15)/4 c) - 2m*(sqrt(3)/2 c) = m c sqrt(15) - m c sqrt(3) = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ≈ m c (3.872 - 1.732) = m c (2.14).
So that part is correct.
Then, after collision, the two photons each with momentum p = 3 m c.
Then, the horizontal components are 2 p cosθ = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).
Which gives cosθ = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / (2*3) = (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3))/6 ≈ (3.872 - 1.732)/6 ≈ 2.14/6 ≈ 0.3567, θ ≈ 69.2°, so angle between them is 138.4°.
Thus, the answer is D) 138.
Alternatively, maybe there is another approach using the CM frame?
Wait, the problem gives the angles in the lab frame where the electron and positron are moving towards each other.
But in the CM frame, the total momentum is zero.
Maybe if we boost to the CM frame, the problem is simpler.
Let's check.
Wait, but perhaps that complicates things.
Since the problem gives the angles in the lab frame, but we derived the answer directly in the lab frame.
Alternatively, maybe there is an error in assuming that the angles are measured in the lab frame.
Wait, the problem statement says "The directions were also measured.
One of the photons was moving in the upper-right direction, while another in the lower-right direction."
So the measurement is in the lab frame where the electron and positron were moving along the horizontal axis.
Therefore, our initial approach is valid.
Therefore, I think the correct answer is D) 138.
</Think>

Answer: The electron and positron collide head-on, annihilating into two photons with equal energy. The goal is to find the angle between the directions of these photons.

1. **Calculate the velocities of the electron and positron:**
   - Electron's Lorentz factor: \( \gamma_e = 4 \)
     - Velocity: \( v_e = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{16}} = \frac{c \sqrt{15}}{4} \)
   - Positron's Lorentz factor: \( \gamma_p = 2 \)
     - Velocity: \( v_p = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{4}} = \frac{c \sqrt{3}}{2} \)

2. **Calculate the total momentum before collision:**
   - Electron's momentum: \( \gamma_e m v_e = 4m \cdot \frac{c \sqrt{15}}{4} = m c \sqrt{15} \) (positive x-direction)
   - Positron's momentum: \( \gamma_p m v_p = 2m \cdot \frac{c \sqrt{3}}{2} = m c \sqrt{3} \) (negative x-direction)
   - Total momentum: \( m c \sqrt{15} - m c \sqrt{3} = m c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}) \)

3. **Energy conservation:**
   - Total initial energy: \( 4mc^2 + 2mc^2 = 6mc^2 \)
   - Energy of each photon: \( 3mc^2 \)
   - Momentum of each photon: \( \frac{3mc^2}{c} = 3mc \)

4. **Momentum conservation in the x-direction:**
   - Let \( \theta \) be the angle each photon makes with the horizontal axis.
   - Horizontal components of photon momenta: \( 2 \cdot 3mc \cdot \cos \theta \)
   - Equate to total momentum: \( 6mc \cos \theta = m c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}) \)
   - Sol: \( \cos \theta = \frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}{6} \approx 0.3567 \)
   - \( \theta \approx 69.2^\circ \)

5. **Angle between photons:**
   - The angle between the upper-right and lower-right directions is \( 2\theta \approx 138.4^\circ \)

The final answer is \boxed{D}.

the angle between two vectors can be calculated using the dot product.

the dot product is cosθ*cosθ + sinθ*(-sinθ) = cos2θ - sin2θ = cos(2θ).
the angle between them is arccos(cos(2θ)) = 2θ.

let me visualize.
if the electron is coming from the left, the positron from the right, after collision, momentum needs to be conserved.
the total momentum before collision must equal the total momentum after collision.
the total momentum before collision is the vector sum of the electron's and positron's momenta.
since they are moving along the horizontal axis, their momenta are along the x-axis.
electron's momentum is in the negative x-direction (since it's moving left to right, but momentum is mγv, and velocity is positive if moving to the right.
wait, maybe we need to clarify.
wait, the lorentz factor is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).
the electron is moving from the left with gamma = 4.
let's take the positive x-direction as right.
so velocity of electron is to the right (i.e., positive x-direction) with speed v_e such that gamma_e = 4.
the positron is moving from the right with gamma_p = 2, so velocity is to the left (negative x-direction) with speed v_p such that gamma_p = 2.
therefore, the total momentum before collision is:
let's think in parallel.
<parallel>
<goal>
<outline>
1: determination of the electron's momentum (p_e) in terms of its rest mass (m) and lorentz factor (γ_e).
</outline>
<outline>
2: determination of the positron's momentum (p_p) in terms of its rest mass (m) and lorentz factor (γ_p).
</outline>
</goal>
<path>
1: the electron's momentum is expressed as p_e = γ_e m v_e, where γ_e is its lorentz factor and v_e is its velocity.
</path>
<path>
2: the momentum of the positron (p_p) is expressed as its rest mass (m) multiplied by its lorentz factor (γ_p) and its velocity (v_p). the positron's velocity (v_p) is directed to the left, corresponding to a negative x-component (-v_p), while its lorentz factor (γ_p) is 2. consequently, the positron's momentum (p_p) is -γ_p m v_p.
</path>
<conclusion>
the electron's momentum is p_e = γ_e m v_e, and the positron's momentum is p_p = -γ_p m v_p, where velocities are considered with respect to the positive x-axis.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
but since the positron is moving to the left, its velocity is negative.
therefore, the total momentum is p_e + p_p = γ_e m v_e - γ_p m v_p.
wait, but we need to relate v_e and v_p to their respective gamma factors.
since gamma_e = 4 and gamma_p = 2.
we know that gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)), so v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2).
therefore, for the electron, v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) = c * sqrt(15/16) = (c * sqrt(15))/4.
similarly, for the positron, v_p = c * sqrt(1 - 1/4) = c * sqrt(3/4) = (c * sqrt(3))/2.
therefore, plugging into total momentum:
p_total = γ_e m v_e - γ_p m v_p
= 4m * (c sqrt(15)/4) - 2m * (c sqrt(3)/2)
= m c sqrt(15) - m c sqrt(3)
= m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))
hmm, so the total momentum is in the positive x-direction (since electron's momentum is larger)?
wait, but the electron is moving to the right (positive x) with higher gamma (so higher momentum), and positron is moving to the left with lower gamma.
therefore, the total momentum is indeed in the positive x-direction.
but after annihilation, two photons are produced moving in upper-right and lower-right directions.
so their momenta must add up to the total momentum before collision (m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))) in the horizontal direction.
since photons move at the speed of light, their energy e is related to momentum p by e = pc.
since the energies of both photons are the same, their momenta must also be the same in magnitude.
let their common momentum be p.
then, the horizontal components of their momenta must add up to the total momentum, and the vertical components must cancel each other (since there was no initial vertical momentum).
therefore, if the angle between each photon's direction and the horizontal axis is θ (upper-right) and -θ (lower-right), then:
horizontal momentum conservation:
p * cosθ + p * cos(-θ) = 2p cosθ = total horizontal momentum (m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)))
vertical momentum conservation:
p * sinθ + p * sin(-θ) = 0, which is automatically satisfied since sin(-θ) = -sinθ.
so, vertical components cancel, which is good since there was no initial vertical momentum.
so from horizontal momentum:
2p cosθ = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))  -- (1)
also, energy conservation.
the total energy before collision must equal the total energy after collision.
the total energy before collision is the sum of the relativistic energies of the electron and positron.
relativistic energy is gamma mc^2.
so:
e_total_before = γ_e mc^2 + γ_p mc^2 = 4 mc^2 + 2 mc^2 = 6 mc^2
after collision, the energy is converted into two photons each of energy e.
since energies are the same, each photon has energy e.
so:
2e = 6 mc^2 => e = 3 mc^2
but for photons, e = pc.
therefore, momentum p of each photon is e/c = 3 mc^2 / c = 3 m c.
so p = 3 m c.
wait, that's helpful.
so each photon has momentum p = 3 m c.
now, going back to equation (1):
2p cosθ = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))
substituting p = 3 m c:
2*(3 m c)*cosθ = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))
simplify:
6 m c cosθ = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))
divide both sides by m c:
6 cosθ = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)
therefore:
cosθ = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6
now, compute the numerical value.
first, calculate sqrt(15) and sqrt(3).
sqrt(15) ≈ 3.872
sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732
therefore, sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 3.872 - 1.732 ≈ 2.14
so cosθ ≈ 2.14 / 6 ≈ 0.3567
then, θ ≈ arccos(0.3567)
let's think in parallel.

2: a linear approximation is used for the cosine function near π/3 (60°) where cos(π/3) = 0.5. the derivative of cosθ is -sinθ. the slope at θ=π/3 is -sin(π/3) ≈ -√3/2 ≈ -0.866. the change in θ (δθ) is given by δθ ≈ (δcosθ)/slope ≈ (0.5 - 0.3567)/0.866 ≈ 0.1433/0.866 ≈ 0.1655 radians. the angle θ is therefore estimated as π/3 + 0.1655 ≈ 1.2217 + 0.1655 ≈ 1.3872 radians. this is approximately 1.3872 * (180/π) ≈ 1.3872 * 57.2958 ≈ 79.3°, which is a rough estimate.

the angle θ was calculated to be approximately 69.2 degrees using a calculator and was estimated to be around 79 degrees using a linear approximation based on cos(π/3)=0.5.

wait, but let's compute it more accurately.
wait, 0.3567.
let me check arccos(0.35):
tables show that cos(69.5°) ≈ 0.358, cos(70°) ≈ 0.342.
wait, 0.3567 is between cos(69.5°) and cos(70°), but closer to 69.5°.
maybe around 69.7°?
alternatively, use calculator:
arccos(0.3567) ≈ 69.2 degrees.
so θ ≈ 69.2°.
therefore, the angle between the two photons is 2θ ≈ 138.4°.
looking at the options, d) 138° is the closest.
so is this correct?
wait, let's check again.
wait, but why is the total momentum in the x-direction positive (to the right), but the angle θ is such that the photons are emitted at 69.2° from the horizontal (upper and lower right).
then the angle between them is 138.4°.
but how does this relate to the total momentum?
alternatively, maybe there's a mistake here.
wait, let's verify the calculations step by step.
1. total momentum before collision:
electron: moving to the right (positive x), gamma = 4.
so velocity v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) = c * sqrt(15/16) = (c sqrt(15))/4 ≈ 0.965 c.
momentum of electron: gamma m v_e = 4 m * (c sqrt(15)/4) = m c sqrt(15).
positron: moving to the left (negative x), gamma = 2.
so velocity v_p = -c * sqrt(1 - 1/4) = -c * sqrt(3/4) = -c sqrt(3)/2 ≈ -0.866 c.
momentum of positron: gamma m |v_p| * direction.
so since it's moving to the left, momentum is negative: 2 m * (c sqrt(3)/2) = m c sqrt(3) in the negative x-direction.
therefore, total momentum is m c sqrt(15) - m c sqrt(3) = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) in the positive x-direction.
correct.
2. energy before collision: 4 mc^2 + 2 mc^2 = 6 mc^2.
after collision, two photons each with energy e.
so 2e = 6 mc^2 => e = 3 mc^2.
therefore, momentum of each photon p = e/c = 3 mc^2 / c = 3 m c.
3. momentum conservation in x-direction: 2 * p cosθ = total momentum.
so 2 * 3 m c * cosθ = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).
canceling m c on both sides:
6 cosθ = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)
=> cosθ = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6 ≈ (3.872 - 1.732) / 6 ≈ 2.14 / 6 ≈ 0.3567
θ ≈ arccos(0.3567) ≈ 69.2 degrees.
therefore, the angle between the two photons is 2θ ≈ 138.4 degrees.
the answer is d) 138 degrees.
but wait, let me check if i made any mistake in the direction of velocities or momenta.
electron moving from left to right (positive x-direction) with gamma = 4.
positron moving from right to left (negative x-direction) with gamma = 2.
therefore, the total momentum is p_e + (-p_p) = gamma_e m v_e - gamma_p m v_p.
but v_e is positive (as velocity is in positive x-direction), v_p is negative (so -p_p becomes positive because p_p = gamma m |v| and direction is negative x, so momentum is -gamma_p m v_p, but here in magnitudes, we have p_p = gamma_p m |v_p|.
wait, perhaps i need to clarify.
wait, momentum is a vector.
so if the positron is moving to the left, its velocity v_p is negative.
thus, the positron's momentum is p_p = gamma_p m v_p (since momentum is m gamma v), which would be negative.
therefore, total momentum is p_e + p_p = gamma_e m v_e + gamma_p m v_p (since v_p is negative).
but when we computed the magnitude earlier:
gamma_e m |v_e| + gamma_p m |v_p| but with signs.
wait, but when calculating the magnitude, do we need to take into account the direction?
wait, perhaps i confused the magnitudes.
wait, no.
let me re-express.
the electron's momentum is in the positive x-direction: p_e = gamma_e m |v_e|.
the positron's momentum is in the negative x-direction: p_p = gamma_p m |v_p|.
therefore, total momentum is p_e - p_p = gamma_e m |v_e| - gamma_p m |v_p|.
so maybe that's the correct expression.
wait, but |v_e| and |v_p| can be calculated from their respective gamma factors.
so let's recalculate:
for electron:
gamma_e = 4 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v_e^2/c^2))
=> v_e^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/16 = 15/16
=> v_e = (sqrt(15)/4) c ≈ 0.965 c (positive x-direction)
for positron:
gamma_p = 2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v_p^2/c^2))
=> v_p^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4
=> v_p = (sqrt(3)/2) c ≈ 0.866 c (but since it's moving to the left, velocity is negative.
but when calculating |v_p|, it's sqrt(3)/2 c.
therefore, total momentum:
gamma_e m |v_e| - gamma_p m |v_p| = 4m*(sqrt(15)/4 c) - 2m*(sqrt(3)/2 c) = m c sqrt(15) - m c sqrt(3) = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ≈ m c (3.872 - 1.732) = m c (2.14).
so that part is correct.
then, after collision, the two photons each with momentum p = 3 m c.
then, the horizontal components are 2 p cosθ = m c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).
which gives cosθ = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / (2*3) = (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3))/6 ≈ (3.872 - 1.732)/6 ≈ 2.14/6 ≈ 0.3567, θ ≈ 69.2°, so angle between them is 138.4°.
thus, the answer is d) 138.
alternatively, maybe there is another approach using the cm frame?
wait, the problem gives the angles in the lab frame where the electron and positron are moving towards each other.
but in the cm frame, the total momentum is zero.
maybe if we boost to the cm frame, the problem is simpler.
let's check.
wait, but perhaps that complicates things.
since the problem gives the angles in the lab frame, but we derived the answer directly in the lab frame.
alternatively, maybe there is an error in assuming that the angles are measured in the lab frame.
wait, the problem statement says "the directions were also measured.
one of the photons was moving in the upper-right direction, while another in the lower-right direction."
so the measurement is in the lab frame where the electron and positron were moving along the horizontal axis.
therefore, our initial approach is valid.
therefore, i think the correct answer is d) 138.
</think>

answer: the electron and positron collide head-on, annihilating into two photons with equal energy. the goal is to find the angle between the directions of these photons.

1. **calculate the velocities of the electron and positron:**
   - electron's lorentz factor: \( \gamma_e = 4 \)
     - velocity: \( v_e = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{16}} = \frac{c \sqrt{15}}{4} \)
   - positron's lorentz factor: \( \gamma_p = 2 \)
     - velocity: \( v_p = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{4}} = \frac{c \sqrt{3}}{2} \)

2. **calculate the total momentum before collision:**
   - electron's momentum: \( \gamma_e m v_e = 4m \cdot \frac{c \sqrt{15}}{4} = m c \sqrt{15} \) (positive x-direction)
   - positron's momentum: \( \gamma_p m v_p = 2m \cdot \frac{c \sqrt{3}}{2} = m c \sqrt{3} \) (negative x-direction)
   - total momentum: \( m c \sqrt{15} - m c \sqrt{3} = m c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}) \)

3. **energy conservation:**
   - total initial energy: \( 4mc^2 + 2mc^2 = 6mc^2 \)
   - energy of each photon: \( 3mc^2 \)
   - momentum of each photon: \( \frac{3mc^2}{c} = 3mc \)

4. **momentum conservation in the x-direction:**
   - let \( \theta \) be the angle each photon makes with the horizontal axis.
   - horizontal components of photon momenta: \( 2 \cdot 3mc \cdot \cos \theta \)
   - equate to total momentum: \( 6mc \cos \theta = m c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}) \)
   - sol: \( \cos \theta = \frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}{6} \approx 0.3567 \)
   - \( \theta \approx 69.2^\circ \)

5. **angle between photons:**
   - the angle between the upper-right and lower-right directions is \( 2\theta \approx 138.4^\circ \)

the final answer is \boxed{d}
