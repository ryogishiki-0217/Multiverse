Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an annihilation process. The reaction is a proton and an antiproton annihilating to produce two positive and two negative particles A. The antiproton is slowly moving, which probably means its velocity is negligible compared to the speed of light, so maybe we can approximate it as at rest? Or moving slowly enough that its kinetic energy is small. The mass of particle A is given as 300 MeV/c2. I need to find the velocity of particle A after the annihilation.
First, I should recall some concepts related to particle annihilation and conservation laws. In such processes, both energy and momentum must be conserved.
Let's think in parallel.

1: Determination of the initial momentum of the system.

2: Determination of the initial energy of the system.

3: Determination of the final momentum and energy of the system.
</Outline>
</Goal>
<Path>
1: The initial momentum of the system is established as zero. This conclusion arises from the antiproton's slow movement, implying its momentum is negligible. The proton, which is presumably at rest, contributes no momentum. The combined momentum of these two particles is therefore zero.
</Path>
<Path>
2: The initial energy of the system is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and the antiproton, along with the kinetic energy of the antiproton. The proton is assumed to be at rest, so its energy is simply its rest energy, m_p c^2. The antiproton has a small kinetic energy, which might be neglected if it's moving slowly enough. The problem states the antiproton is "slowly moving," so its kinetic energy could be considered approximately zero, or perhaps non-relativistic. However, since particle physics often deals with relativistic energies, even for slow-moving particles, it might be necessary to consider the exact contribution. But given that the problem states the antiproton is slowly moving, maybe its velocity is so low that its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest energy. So the initial energy would be approximately 2 * m_p c^2, where m_p is the proton mass.
</Path>
<Path>
3: The final momentum of the system must equal the initial momentum of zero. Therefore, the total momentum of the four particles A must sum to zero. This implies that their momenta must be arranged such that vectorially they cancel out. However, if the particles are emitted in opposite directions with momenta that balance each other, perhaps in pairs.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
The initial momentum of the system is zero. The initial energy is approximately 2m_p c^2, assuming the antiproton's kinetic energy is negligible. The final momentum must also be zero, implying a balanced distribution of momenta among the four particles A.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
The final state consists of two positive and two negative particles A. Each A particle has a mass of 300 MeV/c2. The proton and antiproton masses are much larger; the proton mass is about 938 MeV/c2. So the rest mass energy of the initial particles is 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV. The total rest mass energy of the final particles is 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV. Since 1876 MeV (initial) is greater than 1200 MeV (final), there's enough energy to create the particles with kinetic energy.
But how do I find the velocity of particle A? They probably all move at the same speed but in different directions such that total momentum is conserved (i.e., zero). Wait, but how are their velocities related? If the total momentum must be conserved, then the vector sum of the momenta of the four A particles must equal the initial momentum, which is zero. Therefore, the four momenta of the A particles must sum to zero. If all four particles have the same speed, then their momenta would just be their gamma factors times their velocity. But in what directions are they moving? Since the problem doesn't specify, maybe we can assume they are emitted symmetrically so that their momenta cancel. For example, two pairs moving in opposite directions. But maybe even with that, depending on the angles, but without more information, I might need to consider the non-relativistic or relativistic case. Wait, but given that the mass of A is 300 MeV/c2, and the energy released is 1876 MeV (initial) minus 1200 MeV (final rest mass) equals 676 MeV. This is the total kinetic energy in the final state. But this seems quite a bit of energy, which suggests the particles are moving relativistically. Therefore, we cannot use non-relativistic approximations.
But how to distribute the energy among the four particles. However, if all four particles are produced with the same momentum magnitude (but different directions), then each would have the same gamma factor, since gamma depends on the velocity. Then, their total kinetic energy would be 4*(gamma - 1)*m_A c2. But the problem is that depending on their directions, their momenta subtract in some way. But if the total momentum is zero, then maybe they are emitted in such a way that for every particle moving in one direction, there is an oppositely moving particle with the same momentum. For example, two A+ and two A- moving in directions such that the two positive particles are opposite to each other, and the two negative particles as well, but how does the charge affect momentum? Wait, charge doesn't affect momentum directly. Momentum conservation is independent of charge. So, the momenta of the four particles just need to sum to zero. If all four particles are moving at the same speed but with momenta canceling each other, then each pair could be moving in opposite directions. For instance, the two A+ particles moving in the x and -x directions, and the two A- particles moving in the y and -y directions, but that might not sum to zero momentum. Alternatively, maybe all four are moving in four different directions 90 degrees apart, with momenta magnitudes such that the vector sum is zero. But the problem states "what is the velocity of particle A?" which makes me think that all particles A (both positive and negative) move with the same speed. Therefore, they must have the same gamma factor. If that's the case, then the momentum vectors must sum to zero, but their individual magnitudes are gamma * m_A * v. But how to compute gamma here.
Alternatively, maybe I need to use the invariant Mandelstam variable s, which is the square of the total energy in the center-of-momentum frame. Wait, but since the antiproton is slowly moving, does that mean we are in the rest frame of the proton? Wait, the problem says "the antiproton is slowly moving", so perhaps in its rest frame, or maybe in the lab frame where the antiproton is moving slowly. Hmm. Wait, if the antiproton is slowly moving, perhaps we can take the lab frame where the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with a small velocity. However, since the collision is between a proton and an antiproton, if the antiproton is slowly moving, then the initial kinetic energy is low. But even so, the rest mass energy of the proton and antiproton is 938 MeV each, so 1876 MeV total. The particles produced have a total rest mass energy of 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV, so there is enough energy for pair production. But the problem is about the velocity of the produced particles. So, maybe we need to compute the kinetic energy of each particle A, then from that, find its velocity.
But how much kinetic energy does each particle A have? If we assume that all four particles share the kinetic energy equally, but that may not be the case. However, if they all move at the same speed, then they must each have the same kinetic energy. Wait, but relativistically, equal speed would imply equal kinetic energy only if they have the same mass, which they do. Wait, but no. Wait, if they have the same velocity, then they have the same gamma factor. Therefore, their kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m_A c2 each. But how is the total kinetic energy divided? If we can calculate the total kinetic energy available, then divide by four? But I think this approach is oversimplified. Because the total kinetic energy in the final state is not just the difference between initial and final rest mass energies, because in the initial state, the antiproton is moving. Even though it's slowly moving, maybe we need to account for its kinetic energy. Wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, so perhaps its kinetic energy is negligible. Then, initial energy is approximately 2*m_p c2, and final energy is 4*m_A c2 + kinetic energy. Therefore, the kinetic energy would be 2*m_p c2 - 4*m_A c2. Let me check the numbers: m_p c2 is approximately 938 MeV. So 2*938 = 1876 MeV. 4 * m_A c2 = 4*300 = 1200 MeV. Therefore, 1876 - 1200 = 676 MeV. So the total kinetic energy in the final state is 676 MeV. Therefore, each particle A has 676 / 4 = 169 MeV kinetic energy. Then, the total energy of each particle is kinetic plus rest mass energy: 300 + 169 = 469 MeV. Then, using E = gamma m c2, so gamma = E / (m c2) = 469 / 300 = 1.563. Then, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v2/c2)), so solving for v: sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma2))c = sqrt(1 - 1/(1.563^2))c. Let's compute 1.563 squared: approx 2.44. Then, 1/2.44 is approx 0.4098. Therefore, 1 - 0.4098 = 0.5902. sqrt(0.5902) is approx 0.768c. So approximately 0.77c. But the answer choice B is 0.77c. But wait, is this correct? But wait, this assumes that the kinetic energy is shared equally among the four particles. But in reality, in particle physics, when two particles annihilate, the energy is distributed according to conservation of energy and momentum. If the initial momentum is not zero, then the final momentum must match the initial. But wait, if the antiproton is slowly moving, then initial momentum is approximately m_p v (for proton at rest) plus the antiproton's momentum, which is also approximately bar{p} v. Wait, but antiproton's momentum would be similar. Wait, perhaps I need to consider the exact initial kinetic energy. Wait, maybe I made a mistake by assuming that the initial kinetic energy is zero. The problem states that the antiproton is slowly moving. So perhaps both the proton and antiproton are non-relativistic. Wait, but it doesn't specify whether the proton is moving or not. Wait, the problem statement just says "p + \bar{p}" so a proton and antiproton annihilating. Typically, in such problems, you consider the center-of-momentum frame. But if the antiproton is slowly moving, perhaps we are in a frame where the proton is at rest, and the antiproton has a small velocity. But even so, in that frame, the total initial momentum would be equal to the momentum of the incoming antiproton. Wait, but the problem statement doesn't specify the frame. Hmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe I need to use the invariant approach. The Mandelstam variable s, which is the square of the total energy in the center-of-momentum frame. For the process p + \bar{p} → 2A+ + 2A−, s is the square of the total energy (in CoM frame) available, which equals the invariant mass squared: s = (E_total)^2 = (m_p + m_{\bar{p}} + K)^2, but considering relativistic addition. Wait, maybe I need to think of the threshold energy for producing the four particles. The minimum energy required for the process to occur would be when the initial kinetic energies are just enough to produce the particles at rest. But in this case, since the antiproton is slowly moving, maybe we are above threshold, but with some kinetic energy left for the particles.
But let's think again. If the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving with a small velocity, then in the lab frame, the initial kinetic energy is the rest energy of proton + rest energy of antiproton + kinetic energy of antiproton. But if the antiproton is slowly moving, kinetic energy is negligible. So total initial energy is ~2*m_p c2. The final energy must be equal to this. The final energy is 4*m_A c2 + K, where K is the total kinetic energy of the four particles. Therefore, 2*m_p c2 = 4*m_A c2 + K. Therefore, K = 2*(m_p - 2*m_A)c2. Let's compute m_p - 2*m_A: m_p is 938 MeV/c2, 2*m_A is 2*300 = 600 MeV/c2. So m_p - 2*m_A = 938 - 600 = 338 MeV/c2. Therefore, K = 2 * 338 c2 = 676 MeV. So total kinetic energy is 676 MeV, as before. But now, how is this kinetic energy distributed among the four particles? If they are all emitted with the same momentum (and hence same gamma factor), then each particle's kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)*m_A c2. Then, 4*(gamma - 1)*m_A c2 = 676 MeV. Therefore, (gamma - 1)*300 = 676 / 4 = 169. Then gamma - 1 = 169 / 300 = 0.5633, so gamma = 1.5633. Then, velocity is c*sqrt(1 - 1/gamma2) = c*sqrt(1 - 1/1.56332). Compute 1.5633 squared: approx 2.444. Then 1/2.444 ≈ 0.409. So 1 - 0.409 = 0.591. sqrt(0.591) ≈ 0.769c. So approximately 0.77c. Which is option B. But wait, does this hold? Because this calculation assumes that all particles have the same gamma, which requires that their momenta sum to the initial momentum. Wait, but the initial momentum in this frame (proton at rest, antiproton moving slowly) is the momentum of the antiproton. But we assumed that K (kinetic energy) is all in the particles A, but in the calculation above, we have that the total energy is 2*m_p c2 = 4*m_A c2 + 4*(gamma - 1)*m_A c2. But if the initial momentum is non-zero (since the antiproton is moving), then the final momentum must equal the initial momentum. Therefore, even if we calculate the kinetic energy shared equally, the velocity may be different. Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe the problem expects us to use the rest frame where the total initial momentum is zero. Wait, if the antiproton is slowly moving, in the center-of-momentum frame, the initial momentum is zero. So maybe we need to consider that frame. In that case, total initial energy is sqrt( (m_p c2)^2 + (p_initial c)^2 ) + sqrt( (m_{\bar{p}} c2)^2 + (p_initial c)^2 ) ). But because the antiproton is slowly moving, p_initial << m c, so total energy is approx m_p c2 + m_{\bar{p}}c2 + (p_initial2 c2)/(2 m_p c2) + (p_initial2 c2)/(2 m_{\bar{p}} c2 ). But since the problem doesn't give the antiproton's velocity, maybe we can approximate that the initial kinetic energy of the antiproton is negligible, so total energy is ~ m_p + m_{\bar{p}} = 2 m_p (since antiproton has same mass). Then, the total energy available is 2 m_p c2, and the final rest energy is 4 m_A c2. Therefore, kinetic energy is 2 m_p c2 - 4 m_A c2. Then, same as before. If we proceed like this, then we get that the kinetic energy per particle is 169 MeV, gamma = 1.563, velocity 0.77c. So answer B. But the problem is whether this is correct when the initial momentum isn't zero. Because in the lab frame where the antiproton is moving slowly, the initial momentum is not zero. Therefore, the final momentum must equal the initial momentum. Therefore, even if the particles are emitted with some net momentum, which would require that their individual velocities contribute to both kinetic energy and momentum conservation. But if the antiproton's velocity is negligible, then maybe the initial momentum is negligible, so the final momentum is also approximately zero, meaning the vector sum is zero. But the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, so perhaps it has a small momentum, which would then require the final momentum to be equal to the initial small momentum. But if we assume that all four particles have the same speed and are emitted symmetrically (such that their momenta cancel in certain directions), then maybe the momentum from the antiproton's motion is balanced by one of the particles. Hmm, but without more information, maybe the problem is intended to be solved in the rest frame of the proton-antiproton system. Wait, but if the antiproton is slowly moving, the center-of-momentum (CoM) frame would not be the same as the proton's rest frame. To find the CoM frame, we can calculate the velocity such that the total momentum is zero. Let me see. Let's denote the proton's mass m_p, antiproton's mass m_{\bar{p}} = m_p. Let the antiproton's velocity be v_initial, small. Then, in the CoM frame, the total momentum is zero. The CoM velocity u is given by: m_p * u = m_{\bar{p}} * v_initial (since proton is moving in the opposite direction to the antiproton in the lab frame). But since m_p = m_{\bar{p}}, then u = v_initial / 2. So the CoM frame is moving at u = v_initial / 2 relative to the lab. In this frame, the proton and antiproton have equal and opposite velocities, each of magnitude u. But since the antiproton's velocity v_initial is small, then u is very small. Therefore, in the CoM frame, the initial energy is 2*(m_p c2 + (1/2) m_p u2 ). But since u is small (non-relativistic), the kinetic energy is negligible compared to rest mass energy. Therefore, in the CoM frame, the total initial energy is approximately 2 m_p c2. Then, in this frame, the total final energy (4 m_A c2 + K_final) must equal the total initial energy (≈2 m_p c2). Therefore, K_final ≈ 2 m_p c2 - 4 m_A c2 = 676 MeV as before. Then, in this frame, the total momentum is zero, so the four particles must have momentum vectors summing to zero. If they are emitted symmetrically, their momenta cancel, but each has the same speed. Therefore, the kinetic energy per particle is 169 MeV, leading to velocity 0.77c. Therefore, in the CoM frame, their speed is 0.77c. But the question is, is the CoM frame moving relative to the lab? Since the CoM frame is moving at u = v_initial / 2, which is very small (as the antiproton is slowly moving). Therefore, the velocity of the particles in the lab frame would be the velocity in the CoM frame plus u (or minus u depending on direction). But since u is very small, the velocity in the lab frame would be approximately the same as in the CoM frame. Therefore, the answer is still 0.77c. But maybe the problem doesn't require considering relativistic velocity addition because the velocities are non-relativistic. Wait, but 0.77c is quite relativistic, so maybe there is an error here. Wait, if we are working in the CoM frame where the initial momentum is zero, and the final momentum must also be zero. Therefore, the four particles must have momentum vectors summing to zero. If they are emitted symmetrically, each pair in opposite directions. Suppose all four particles move along the x and y axes, each with equal momentum magnitude. For example, two particles along the x-axis in opposite directions, and two along the y-axis. Then each has momentum p, so the total momentum is zero. Then, the magnitude of each momentum is p = gamma m_A v. Then, since energy per particle is E = gamma m_A c2 = m_A c2 + K. Total energy is 4 gamma m_A c2 = 2 m_p c2 (approx). Then, gamma = (2 m_p c2) / (4 m_A c2) ) = (2 * 938) / (4 * 300) ) ≈ 1.563, same as before. Therefore, velocity is sqrt(1 - 1/(1.563^2)) c ≈ 0.77c. Therefore, regardless of the frame, the magnitude of the velocity is 0.77c. So the answer is B. However, another approach could be using four-vector formalism. The initial four-momentum is (E_p, p_p) for the proton and (E_{\bar{p}}, p_{\bar{p}}) for the antiproton. If the proton is at rest, then p_p = 0, E_p = m_p c2. The antiproton has kinetic energy K and momentum p. Since it's slowly moving, K ≈ (1/2) m_{\bar{p}} v2 and p = m_{\bar{p}} v. The total initial four-momentum is (m_p c2 + gamma m_{\bar{p}} c2, 0 + gamma m_{\bar{p}} v ). The final four-momentum is the sum of four four-momenta of the A particles. Each A particle has energy gamma_i m_A c2 and momentum gamma_i m_A v_i. But since we are to find the velocity of particle A, which probably all have the same speed, then gamma_i = gamma and v_i = v. Then, the total final four-momentum is (4 gamma m_A c2, sum(p_i)), where sum(p_i) is the vector sum of the momenta. But since the initial momentum is (gamma m_{\bar{p}} v) in the x-direction (assuming antiproton moving along x), the final momentum must also have a net momentum of gamma m_{\bar{p}} v. But how to distribute this momentum among the four particles. If the four particles are emitted symmetrically, two with momentum along the x-axis (one positive, one negative), and two with zero x-momentum. Wait, but this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, if we use the fact that in the final state, the total momentum is the same as the initial momentum, and each particle has momentum p_f. But given the symmetry, perhaps the problem is designed such that all particles have the same speed and momentum directed at angles such that the vector sum equals the initial momentum. But without specific angles, this is hard to compute. However, given that the problem gives a single velocity answer, and in the previous approach we got 0.77c assuming the CoM frame, which is moving only slightly relative to the lab frame, so the velocity in the lab frame is approximately the same. Therefore, the answer is B) 0.77c. So the final answer is \boxed{B}.
</Think>

Answer: To solve the problem of finding the velocity of particle A after the annihilation process \( p + \bar{p} \rightarrow 2A^{+} + 2A^{-} \), we need to consider conservation of energy and momentum. 

1. **Energy Conservation**: The initial energy comes from the rest mass energy of the proton and antiproton, since the antiproton's kinetic energy is negligible. The total initial energy is approximately \( 2m_p c^2 \). The final energy consists of the rest mass energy of the four particles A and their kinetic energy. 

2. **Total Energy Calculation**:
   - Initial energy: \( 2 \times 938 \, \text{MeV} = 1876 \, \text{MeV} \)
   - Final rest energy: \( 4 \times 300 \, \text{MeV} = 1200 \, \text{MeV} \)
   - Kinetic energy available: \( 1876 \, \text{MeV} - 1200 \, \text{MeV} = 676 \, \text{MeV} \)

3. **Kinetic Energy Distribution**: Assuming the kinetic energy is shared equally among the four particles A, each particle receives \( \frac{676 \, \text{MeV}}{4} = 169 \, \text{MeV} \).

4. **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**: 
   - Total energy per particle A: \( 300 \, \text{MeV} + 169 \, \text{MeV} = 469 \, \text{MeV} \)
   - Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is calculated as \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m_A c^2} = \frac{469}{300} \approx 1.563 \)

5. **Velocity Calculation**: Using the relation \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (v^2/c^2)}} \), solving for \( v \):
   - \( \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \approx \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{1.563^2}} \approx \sqrt{0.591} \approx 0.77c \)

Thus, the velocity of particle A is determined to be approximately \( 0.77c \).

\boxed{B}

the final state consists of two positive and two negative particles a. each a particle has a mass of 300 mev/c2. the proton and antiproton masses are much larger; the proton mass is about 938 mev/c2. so the rest mass energy of the initial particles is 2 * 938 = 1876 mev. the total rest mass energy of the final particles is 4 * 300 = 1200 mev. since 1876 mev (initial) is greater than 1200 mev (final), there's enough energy to create the particles with kinetic energy.
but how do i find the velocity of particle a? they probably all move at the same speed but in different directions such that total momentum is conserved (i.e., zero). wait, but how are their velocities related? if the total momentum must be conserved, then the vector sum of the momenta of the four a particles must equal the initial momentum, which is zero. therefore, the four momenta of the a particles must sum to zero. if all four particles have the same speed, then their momenta would just be their gamma factors times their velocity. but in what directions are they moving? since the problem doesn't specify, maybe we can assume they are emitted symmetrically so that their momenta cancel. for example, two pairs moving in opposite directions. but maybe even with that, depending on the angles, but without more information, i might need to consider the non-relativistic or relativistic case. wait, but given that the mass of a is 300 mev/c2, and the energy released is 1876 mev (initial) minus 1200 mev (final rest mass) equals 676 mev. this is the total kinetic energy in the final state. but this seems quite a bit of energy, which suggests the particles are moving relativistically. therefore, we cannot use non-relativistic approximations.
but how to distribute the energy among the four particles. however, if all four particles are produced with the same momentum magnitude (but different directions), then each would have the same gamma factor, since gamma depends on the velocity. then, their total kinetic energy would be 4*(gamma - 1)*m_a c2. but the problem is that depending on their directions, their momenta subtract in some way. but if the total momentum is zero, then maybe they are emitted in such a way that for every particle moving in one direction, there is an oppositely moving particle with the same momentum. for example, two a+ and two a- moving in directions such that the two positive particles are opposite to each other, and the two negative particles as well, but how does the charge affect momentum? wait, charge doesn't affect momentum directly. momentum conservation is independent of charge. so, the momenta of the four particles just need to sum to zero. if all four particles are moving at the same speed but with momenta canceling each other, then each pair could be moving in opposite directions. for instance, the two a+ particles moving in the x and -x directions, and the two a- particles moving in the y and -y directions, but that might not sum to zero momentum. alternatively, maybe all four are moving in four different directions 90 degrees apart, with momenta magnitudes such that the vector sum is zero. but the problem states "what is the velocity of particle a?" which makes me think that all particles a (both positive and negative) move with the same speed. therefore, they must have the same gamma factor. if that's the case, then the momentum vectors must sum to zero, but their individual magnitudes are gamma * m_a * v. but how to compute gamma here.
alternatively, maybe i need to use the invariant mandelstam variable s, which is the square of the total energy in the center-of-momentum frame. wait, but since the antiproton is slowly moving, does that mean we are in the rest frame of the proton? wait, the problem says "the antiproton is slowly moving", so perhaps in its rest frame, or maybe in the lab frame where the antiproton is moving slowly. hmm. wait, if the antiproton is slowly moving, perhaps we can take the lab frame where the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with a small velocity. however, since the collision is between a proton and an antiproton, if the antiproton is slowly moving, then the initial kinetic energy is low. but even so, the rest mass energy of the proton and antiproton is 938 mev each, so 1876 mev total. the particles produced have a total rest mass energy of 4 * 300 = 1200 mev, so there is enough energy for pair production. but the problem is about the velocity of the produced particles. so, maybe we need to compute the kinetic energy of each particle a, then from that, find its velocity.
but how much kinetic energy does each particle a have? if we assume that all four particles share the kinetic energy equally, but that may not be the case. however, if they all move at the same speed, then they must each have the same kinetic energy. wait, but relativistically, equal speed would imply equal kinetic energy only if they have the same mass, which they do. wait, but no. wait, if they have the same velocity, then they have the same gamma factor. therefore, their kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m_a c2 each. but how is the total kinetic energy divided? if we can calculate the total kinetic energy available, then divide by four? but i think this approach is oversimplified. because the total kinetic energy in the final state is not just the difference between initial and final rest mass energies, because in the initial state, the antiproton is moving. even though it's slowly moving, maybe we need to account for its kinetic energy. wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, so perhaps its kinetic energy is negligible. then, initial energy is approximately 2*m_p c2, and final energy is 4*m_a c2 + kinetic energy. therefore, the kinetic energy would be 2*m_p c2 - 4*m_a c2. let me check the numbers: m_p c2 is approximately 938 mev. so 2*938 = 1876 mev. 4 * m_a c2 = 4*300 = 1200 mev. therefore, 1876 - 1200 = 676 mev. so the total kinetic energy in the final state is 676 mev. therefore, each particle a has 676 / 4 = 169 mev kinetic energy. then, the total energy of each particle is kinetic plus rest mass energy: 300 + 169 = 469 mev. then, using e = gamma m c2, so gamma = e / (m c2) = 469 / 300 = 1.563. then, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v2/c2)), so solving for v: sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma2))c = sqrt(1 - 1/(1.563^2))c. let's compute 1.563 squared: approx 2.44. then, 1/2.44 is approx 0.4098. therefore, 1 - 0.4098 = 0.5902. sqrt(0.5902) is approx 0.768c. so approximately 0.77c. but the answer choice b is 0.77c. but wait, is this correct? but wait, this assumes that the kinetic energy is shared equally among the four particles. but in reality, in particle physics, when two particles annihilate, the energy is distributed according to conservation of energy and momentum. if the initial momentum is not zero, then the final momentum must match the initial. but wait, if the antiproton is slowly moving, then initial momentum is approximately m_p v (for proton at rest) plus the antiproton's momentum, which is also approximately bar{p} v. wait, but antiproton's momentum would be similar. wait, perhaps i need to consider the exact initial kinetic energy. wait, maybe i made a mistake by assuming that the initial kinetic energy is zero. the problem states that the antiproton is slowly moving. so perhaps both the proton and antiproton are non-relativistic. wait, but it doesn't specify whether the proton is moving or not. wait, the problem statement just says "p + \bar{p}" so a proton and antiproton annihilating. typically, in such problems, you consider the center-of-momentum frame. but if the antiproton is slowly moving, perhaps we are in a frame where the proton is at rest, and the antiproton has a small velocity. but even so, in that frame, the total initial momentum would be equal to the momentum of the incoming antiproton. wait, but the problem statement doesn't specify the frame. hmm. this is getting complicated. maybe i need to use the invariant approach. the mandelstam variable s, which is the square of the total energy in the center-of-momentum frame. for the process p + \bar{p} → 2a+ + 2a−, s is the square of the total energy (in com frame) available, which equals the invariant mass squared: s = (e_total)^2 = (m_p + m_{\bar{p}} + k)^2, but considering relativistic addition. wait, maybe i need to think of the threshold energy for producing the four particles. the minimum energy required for the process to occur would be when the initial kinetic energies are just enough to produce the particles at rest. but in this case, since the antiproton is slowly moving, maybe we are above threshold, but with some kinetic energy left for the particles.
but let's think again. if the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving with a small velocity, then in the lab frame, the initial kinetic energy is the rest energy of proton + rest energy of antiproton + kinetic energy of antiproton. but if the antiproton is slowly moving, kinetic energy is negligible. so total initial energy is ~2*m_p c2. the final energy must be equal to this. the final energy is 4*m_a c2 + k, where k is the total kinetic energy of the four particles. therefore, 2*m_p c2 = 4*m_a c2 + k. therefore, k = 2*(m_p - 2*m_a)c2. let's compute m_p - 2*m_a: m_p is 938 mev/c2, 2*m_a is 2*300 = 600 mev/c2. so m_p - 2*m_a = 938 - 600 = 338 mev/c2. therefore, k = 2 * 338 c2 = 676 mev. so total kinetic energy is 676 mev, as before. but now, how is this kinetic energy distributed among the four particles? if they are all emitted with the same momentum (and hence same gamma factor), then each particle's kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)*m_a c2. then, 4*(gamma - 1)*m_a c2 = 676 mev. therefore, (gamma - 1)*300 = 676 / 4 = 169. then gamma - 1 = 169 / 300 = 0.5633, so gamma = 1.5633. then, velocity is c*sqrt(1 - 1/gamma2) = c*sqrt(1 - 1/1.56332). compute 1.5633 squared: approx 2.444. then 1/2.444 ≈ 0.409. so 1 - 0.409 = 0.591. sqrt(0.591) ≈ 0.769c. so approximately 0.77c. which is option b. but wait, does this hold? because this calculation assumes that all particles have the same gamma, which requires that their momenta sum to the initial momentum. wait, but the initial momentum in this frame (proton at rest, antiproton moving slowly) is the momentum of the antiproton. but we assumed that k (kinetic energy) is all in the particles a, but in the calculation above, we have that the total energy is 2*m_p c2 = 4*m_a c2 + 4*(gamma - 1)*m_a c2. but if the initial momentum is non-zero (since the antiproton is moving), then the final momentum must equal the initial momentum. therefore, even if we calculate the kinetic energy shared equally, the velocity may be different. wait, this is getting confusing. maybe the problem expects us to use the rest frame where the total initial momentum is zero. wait, if the antiproton is slowly moving, in the center-of-momentum frame, the initial momentum is zero. so maybe we need to consider that frame. in that case, total initial energy is sqrt( (m_p c2)^2 + (p_initial c)^2 ) + sqrt( (m_{\bar{p}} c2)^2 + (p_initial c)^2 ) ). but because the antiproton is slowly moving, p_initial << m c, so total energy is approx m_p c2 + m_{\bar{p}}c2 + (p_initial2 c2)/(2 m_p c2) + (p_initial2 c2)/(2 m_{\bar{p}} c2 ). but since the problem doesn't give the antiproton's velocity, maybe we can approximate that the initial kinetic energy of the antiproton is negligible, so total energy is ~ m_p + m_{\bar{p}} = 2 m_p (since antiproton has same mass). then, the total energy available is 2 m_p c2, and the final rest energy is 4 m_a c2. therefore, kinetic energy is 2 m_p c2 - 4 m_a c2. then, same as before. if we proceed like this, then we get that the kinetic energy per particle is 169 mev, gamma = 1.563, velocity 0.77c. so answer b. but the problem is whether this is correct when the initial momentum isn't zero. because in the lab frame where the antiproton is moving slowly, the initial momentum is not zero. therefore, the final momentum must equal the initial momentum. therefore, even if the particles are emitted with some net momentum, which would require that their individual velocities contribute to both kinetic energy and momentum conservation. but if the antiproton's velocity is negligible, then maybe the initial momentum is negligible, so the final momentum is also approximately zero, meaning the vector sum is zero. but the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, so perhaps it has a small momentum, which would then require the final momentum to be equal to the initial small momentum. but if we assume that all four particles have the same speed and are emitted symmetrically (such that their momenta cancel in certain directions), then maybe the momentum from the antiproton's motion is balanced by one of the particles. hmm, but without more information, maybe the problem is intended to be solved in the rest frame of the proton-antiproton system. wait, but if the antiproton is slowly moving, the center-of-momentum (com) frame would not be the same as the proton's rest frame. to find the com frame, we can calculate the velocity such that the total momentum is zero. let me see. let's denote the proton's mass m_p, antiproton's mass m_{\bar{p}} = m_p. let the antiproton's velocity be v_initial, small. then, in the com frame, the total momentum is zero. the com velocity u is given by: m_p * u = m_{\bar{p}} * v_initial (since proton is moving in the opposite direction to the antiproton in the lab frame). but since m_p = m_{\bar{p}}, then u = v_initial / 2. so the com frame is moving at u = v_initial / 2 relative to the lab. in this frame, the proton and antiproton have equal and opposite velocities, each of magnitude u. but since the antiproton's velocity v_initial is small, then u is very small. therefore, in the com frame, the initial energy is 2*(m_p c2 + (1/2) m_p u2 ). but since u is small (non-relativistic), the kinetic energy is negligible compared to rest mass energy. therefore, in the com frame, the total initial energy is approximately 2 m_p c2. then, in this frame, the total final energy (4 m_a c2 + k_final) must equal the total initial energy (≈2 m_p c2). therefore, k_final ≈ 2 m_p c2 - 4 m_a c2 = 676 mev as before. then, in this frame, the total momentum is zero, so the four particles must have momentum vectors summing to zero. if they are emitted symmetrically, their momenta cancel, but each has the same speed. therefore, the kinetic energy per particle is 169 mev, leading to velocity 0.77c. therefore, in the com frame, their speed is 0.77c. but the question is, is the com frame moving relative to the lab? since the com frame is moving at u = v_initial / 2, which is very small (as the antiproton is slowly moving). therefore, the velocity of the particles in the lab frame would be the velocity in the com frame plus u (or minus u depending on direction). but since u is very small, the velocity in the lab frame would be approximately the same as in the com frame. therefore, the answer is still 0.77c. but maybe the problem doesn't require considering relativistic velocity addition because the velocities are non-relativistic. wait, but 0.77c is quite relativistic, so maybe there is an error here. wait, if we are working in the com frame where the initial momentum is zero, and the final momentum must also be zero. therefore, the four particles must have momentum vectors summing to zero. if they are emitted symmetrically, each pair in opposite directions. suppose all four particles move along the x and y axes, each with equal momentum magnitude. for example, two particles along the x-axis in opposite directions, and two along the y-axis. then each has momentum p, so the total momentum is zero. then, the magnitude of each momentum is p = gamma m_a v. then, since energy per particle is e = gamma m_a c2 = m_a c2 + k. total energy is 4 gamma m_a c2 = 2 m_p c2 (approx). then, gamma = (2 m_p c2) / (4 m_a c2) ) = (2 * 938) / (4 * 300) ) ≈ 1.563, same as before. therefore, velocity is sqrt(1 - 1/(1.563^2)) c ≈ 0.77c. therefore, regardless of the frame, the magnitude of the velocity is 0.77c. so the answer is b. however, another approach could be using four-vector formalism. the initial four-momentum is (e_p, p_p) for the proton and (e_{\bar{p}}, p_{\bar{p}}) for the antiproton. if the proton is at rest, then p_p = 0, e_p = m_p c2. the antiproton has kinetic energy k and momentum p. since it's slowly moving, k ≈ (1/2) m_{\bar{p}} v2 and p = m_{\bar{p}} v. the total initial four-momentum is (m_p c2 + gamma m_{\bar{p}} c2, 0 + gamma m_{\bar{p}} v ). the final four-momentum is the sum of four four-momenta of the a particles. each a particle has energy gamma_i m_a c2 and momentum gamma_i m_a v_i. but since we are to find the velocity of particle a, which probably all have the same speed, then gamma_i = gamma and v_i = v. then, the total final four-momentum is (4 gamma m_a c2, sum(p_i)), where sum(p_i) is the vector sum of the momenta. but since the initial momentum is (gamma m_{\bar{p}} v) in the x-direction (assuming antiproton moving along x), the final momentum must also have a net momentum of gamma m_{\bar{p}} v. but how to distribute this momentum among the four particles. if the four particles are emitted symmetrically, two with momentum along the x-axis (one positive, one negative), and two with zero x-momentum. wait, but this is getting too complicated. alternatively, if we use the fact that in the final state, the total momentum is the same as the initial momentum, and each particle has momentum p_f. but given the symmetry, perhaps the problem is designed such that all particles have the same speed and momentum directed at angles such that the vector sum equals the initial momentum. but without specific angles, this is hard to compute. however, given that the problem gives a single velocity answer, and in the previous approach we got 0.77c assuming the com frame, which is moving only slightly relative to the lab frame, so the velocity in the lab frame is approximately the same. therefore, the answer is b) 0.77c. so the final answer is \boxed{b}.
</think>

answer: to solve the problem of finding the velocity of particle a after the annihilation process \( p + \bar{p} \rightarrow 2a^{+} + 2a^{-} \), we need to consider conservation of energy and momentum. 

1. **energy conservation**: the initial energy comes from the rest mass energy of the proton and antiproton, since the antiproton's kinetic energy is negligible. the total initial energy is approximately \( 2m_p c^2 \). the final energy consists of the rest mass energy of the four particles a and their kinetic energy. 

2. **total energy calculation**:
   - initial energy: \( 2 \times 938 \, \text{mev} = 1876 \, \text{mev} \)
   - final rest energy: \( 4 \times 300 \, \text{mev} = 1200 \, \text{mev} \)
   - kinetic energy available: \( 1876 \, \text{mev} - 1200 \, \text{mev} = 676 \, \text{mev} \)

3. **kinetic energy distribution**: assuming the kinetic energy is shared equally among the four particles a, each particle receives \( \frac{676 \, \text{mev}}{4} = 169 \, \text{mev} \).

4. **relativistic energy-momentum relation**: 
   - total energy per particle a: \( 300 \, \text{mev} + 169 \, \text{mev} = 469 \, \text{mev} \)
   - lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is calculated as \( \gamma = \frac{e}{m_a c^2} = \frac{469}{300} \approx 1.563 \)

5. **velocity calculation**: using the relation \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (v^2/c^2)}} \), solving for \( v \):
   - \( \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \approx \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{1.563^2}} \approx \sqrt{0.591} \approx 0.77c \)

thus, the velocity of particle a is determined to be approximately \( 0.77c \).

\boxed{b}
