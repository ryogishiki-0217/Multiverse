Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution radiating power in the radiation zone. We need to find the fraction of the maximum power A radiated at an angle θ = 30°, and also determine the angular dependence function f, which would tell us how the power per unit solid angle depends on λ and θ. The options are A through D, each giving a fraction and a λ dependence.
First, let me recall some concepts about radiation from oscillating charges. When a charge oscillates, it emits electromagnetic radiation. The power radiated depends on the acceleration of the charge. For a dipole radiator, the power radiated per unit solid angle has a well-known angular dependence of sin2θ. However, the problem here is a spheroidal charge distribution oscillating. Spheroidal shapes are like slightly flattened spheres, either prolate (like a American football) or oblate (like a frisbee). The symmetry axis is along the z-axis, so the oscillation is likely along this axis, making it a quadrupole or higher-order moment? But wait, oscillating charge distributions can radiate even as dipoles. Wait, a changing dipole moment is a source of radiation. Let me think. If the charge distribution is spheroidal, that might imply a quadrupole moment is present. But even a dipole can radiate. Hmm. But the problem mentions the radiation zone, so we can use the formulas for the radiation field in the far zone.
The power radiated per unit solid angle for an oscillating electric dipole is given by:
dP/dΩ = ( ( (1/(4πε0)) * (e2 a2 / c6) ) * ( ( ( (sinθ)^3 ) / (8π) ) ) * something? Wait, maybe I should recall the Larmor formula. The total power radiated by an accelerating charge is P = (e2 a2)/(6πε0 c3). But for an oscillating dipole, the radiation pattern has a sin2θ dependence. Wait, actually, the dipole radiation has a power per unit solid angle proportional to sin2θ. So if the maximum power is along the equator (θ = 90°), and zero along the axis (θ = 0° or 180°). But here, the charge distribution is spheroidal with symmetry along the z-axis. If it's oscillating, perhaps it's a quadrupole? Quadrupole radiation falls off as 1/r2 instead of dipole's 1/r, but I need to recall the angular dependence. Wait, maybe the angular dependence for a quadrupole is different. Let me think. For a electric quadrupole, the potential is proportional to 1/r3, and the angular dependence is related to the Legendre polynomials. The radiation field for a quadrupole would involve higher-order terms. Specifically, the angular dependence for a quadrupole radiation is proportional to P2(cosθ), which is (3cos2θ -1). So the angular distribution would have a different pattern. The dipole is proportional to P1, which is cosθ, but squared gives cos2θ, which after some factor becomes sin2θ when you consider the radiation. Wait, maybe I need to remember that the radiated power from a multipole moment l falls off as 1/r^(l+1) and the angular dependence involves P_l (Legendre polynomials). For dipole, l=1, so 1/r2 and P1. For quadrupole, l=2, 1/r3 and P2.
But in the problem, the charge distribution is spheroidal. A spheroid is an ellipsoid with two axes equal. If it's oscillating along the symmetry axis (z-axis), perhaps this leads to a quadrupole moment. Alternatively, if the oscillation is such that the charge distribution is changing its shape but保持对称 axis, maybe higher multipoles are involved. However, even for a spheroidal distribution, the dominant radiation might still be dipole or quadrupole. But the key point here is that the radiation's angular dependence is different for different multipoles. For a quadrupole, the angular dependence would be proportional to (3cos2θ -1). So the radiation pattern would have a different angular dependence than the dipole. The maximum of this would be when cos2θ is maximum, which is when cosθ = ±1, i.e., θ = 0° or 180°, so along the axis. But wait, the standard dipole radiation is strongest in the equatorial plane (θ=90°), whereas a quadrupole would have a different pattern.
But the problem states that the maximum power is A. So depending on whether it's a dipole or quadrupole, the maximum would occur at different angles. If the charge distribution is spheroidal and oscillating along the z-axis, perhaps the radiation is strongest along the equator, like a dipole, or along the axis, like a quadrupole.
But the answer options mention fractions of A at θ=30°. Let's think. If it's a dipole, the power per unit solid angle is proportional to sin2θ. The maximum is at θ=90° (sinθ=1), so A occurs there. Then at θ=30°, sinθ=1/2, so sin2θ=1/4. Therefore, the power there would be 1/4 of A. But option B says 1/4, and option C says 1/4 as well. Then the other part is the λ dependence. Hmm. Wait, but if it's a dipole radiation, the power depends on frequency as ω4, and wavelength as λ^-6. Wait, let me recall Larmor's formula. The power radiated by an accelerating charge is proportional to a2, which is (ω2 x0)^2 if the acceleration a = ω2 x0. So total power proportional to ω4. But for a dipole, the radiated power is proportional to (e2 a2)/c3, which would be proportional to ω4. Then, since c = λν, and ω = 2πν = 2πc/λ. So replacing ω with 2πc/λ, ω4 becomes (2πc/λ)^4 = (2π)^4 c^4 /λ^4. Therefore, power proportional to 1/λ^4. Wait, but Larmor formula gives total power proportional to ω4, which via c and λ would be 1/λ^4. But in the options, some have λ^-6 or λ^-3. For example, option A says λ^-6. So maybe dipole is λ^-4, and quadrupole would have different dependencies?
Wait, for higher multipoles, the power radiated falls off more strongly with distance, but here we are talking about the radiated power per unit solid angle. For a multipole of order l, the power per unit solid angle is proportional to 1/r2 * (1/r)^(l+1), but in the radiation zone, the angular distribution is given by the Legendre polynomial P_l(cosθ). However, the total power for higher multipoles would involve higher powers of the source's parameters. For example, a quadrupole moment Q radiates power proportional to Q2, which might involve (d2 dipole/dt2) or similar.
But perhaps the key difference is that for a quadrupole, the power radiated per unit solid angle would have an angular dependence of P2(cosθ) and a wavelength dependence scaling with ω^6? Let me check. The angular pattern for quadrupole radiation is (3cos2θ - 1), so if the maximum of the radiation is along the axis (θ=0), then the value at θ=30° would be 3*(√3/2)^2 -1 = 3*(3/4) -1 = 9/4 -1 = 5/4. Wait, but that's if the maximum is at θ=0. However, the problem says the maximum power is A. So if the angular dependence is (3cos2θ -1), the maximum would be where cos2θ is maximum, i.e., θ=0 or π. Then the maximum value is 3*1 -1 = 2. So A=2, and at θ=30°, cosθ=√3/2, so cos2θ=3/4, so 3*(3/4) -1 = 9/4 -1 = 5/4. Then the fraction would be (5/4)/2 = 5/8. But none of the options have 5/8. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the angular dependence is different. Alternatively, maybe the problem is not a quadrupole. Let me consider other possibilities.
The charge distribution is spheroidal. A spheroid is generated by rotating an ellipse about one of its axes. If it's a prolate spheroid (like a rugby ball), it's elongated along the axis. If it's an oblate spheroid (like a disk), it's flattened along the axis. The oscillation is along the symmetry axis (z-axis). So if it's an oblate spheroid oscillating, the deformation would be along the z-axis, leading to a change in the quadrupole moment. Therefore, this could be a source of quadrupole radiation.
If it's quadrupole radiation, then the angular dependence is (3cos2θ -1). The maximum value of this function is +2, occurring at θ=0° and 180°, and the minimum is -1 at θ=90°. However, the power radiated per unit solid angle is proportional to the square of the multipole moment, but for a quadrupole, the angular distribution is indeed (3cos2θ -1)^2? Wait, no. Let me clarify. The far-field electric and magnetic fields for a quadrupole involve the Legendre polynomial P2(cosθ). Specifically, the radiation field would go like P2(cosθ)/r. The power per unit solid angle (intensity) is proportional to |E|^2, so that would be proportional to (P2)^2 / r2. Since the standard dipole power per unit solid angle is proportional to sin^2θ, which is (1 - cos^2θ), and for quadrupole, it would be (3cos2θ -1)^2. So, expanding that, 9cos^4θ -6cos2θ +1. So the angular distribution is a quartic function in cosθ. But the problem states that the radiated power per unit solid angle is a function f(λ, θ). The maximum power is A. So depending on the multipole moment, the maximum could be at a different angle. If the angular distribution is (3cos2θ -1)^2, then the maximum occurs where 3cos2θ -1 is maximized, i.e., cos2θ=1, so cosθ=±1, θ=0° or 180°. So the maximum intensity is at the poles, and the value there is (3*1 -1)^2 = 4, so 4*k, where k is some proportionality constant. The minimum would be at θ=90°, with value (3*0 -1)^2=1*k. So if the maximum power is A, then at θ=30°, cosθ=√3/2, so 3cos2θ -1 = 3*(3/4) -1 = 9/4 -1 = 5/4. So the intensity there would be (5/4)^2 = 25/16. Therefore, the fraction compared to A is (25/16)/4 = 25/64 ≈ 0.39. Hmm, 25/64 is approximately 0.39, which is roughly 39%. None of the options have this. So maybe this approach is incorrect.
Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not about a quadrupole but a different type of source. Let me think again. The charge distribution is spheroidal, with symmetry along the z-axis, oscillating. If the oscillation is such that the charge is moving back and forth along the z-axis, even though the distribution is spheroidal, perhaps the dominant term is a dipole. For example, if you have a spherical charge distribution oscillating as a dipole, you get standard dipole radiation. But a spheroidal distribution might have a quadrupole moment as well. However, the question may be assuming that the oscillation is such that the dominant term is a quadrupole. Let's check.
Alternatively, maybe the problem is related to the fact that the charge distribution is spheroidal, so the oscillation could lead to a different radiation pattern. But I need to recall that for an oscillating charge distribution, the radiated power in the dipole approximation is given by the standard formula:
P = (e2 ω4 a2)/(6π ε0 c3)
But for higher multipoles, the power radiated is higher order in the oscillation amplitude or frequency. However, if the problem is about the angular dependence, maybe the dominant term here is quadrupole. Let's assume that.
If the angular dependence is (3cos2θ -1), then at θ=30°, as calculated earlier, the value is 5/4. But compared to the maximum value, which is 2, the ratio would be (5/4)/2 = 5/8 ≈ 0.625. None of the options have this either. So perhaps my assumption is wrong.
Alternatively, maybe the oscillation is such that the charge distribution is oscillating in a way that creates a dipole field. For a oscillating electric dipole, the radiated power per unit solid angle is proportional to sin2θ. The maximum is at θ=90° (equatorial plane), which would correspond to A. Then at θ=30°, sinθ=1/2, so sin2θ=1/4. Therefore, the power there is 1/4 of A, which is option B and C's first part. Then the λ dependence: for dipole radiation, power is proportional to ω^4, and since ω = 2πc/λ, substituting gives power proportional to (1/λ^4). So the function f would include a λ^-4 term. So then the answer would be B or D. But option D says 1/2, which isn't sin2theta at 30°, so the answer would be B. However, the possible form of f is lambda^-4. But in the options, A is lambda^-6, B is lambda^-4, C is lambda^-3, D is lambda^-4. So if it's dipole radiation, then the power per unit solid angle is proportional to 1/λ^4 (since power goes as ω^4 and omega is 2pi c / lambda, so omega^4 is proportional to 1/lambda^4). Therefore, the function f would be proportional to 1/lambda^4. So that's the second part. Then, combining this, the fraction is 1/4 and lambda^-4, which is option B. Alternatively, if the answer is B, let me check again. But wait, the problem states "the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of λ and the angle θ". So f has dependence on both λ and θ. For dipole radiation, the power per unit solid angle is proportional to (ω^4)/r2 times sin2θ. Since ω=2πc/λ, then replacing ω, the power per unit solid angle is proportional to ( (2πc/λ)^4 ) / r2 * sin2θ. But in the radiation zone, r is the distance from the source, but since we are considering the intensity (power per unit solid angle), r2 is factored out. Therefore, the intensity is proportional to (2πc/λ)^4 * sin2θ. So the intensity as a function of λ and θ is ~ λ^-4 sin2θ. Therefore, f(λ,θ) = k * sin2θ / λ^4, where k is a constant. Therefore, the maximum value A would be at sinθ=1 (θ=90°), so A = k / λ^4. Then, at θ=30°, sinθ=1/2, so the power is (k / λ^4) * (1/4). So the fraction compared to A is 1/4, and the function f is proportional to λ^-4. So the correct answer would be B) 1/4, lambda^-4.
But wait, the options say "the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle θ = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively," so the first part is the fraction (1/4) and the second part is the form of f (lambda^-4). So answer B. But wait, another thought: if the charge distribution is spheroidal, maybe the radiation isn't dipolar. If it's a higher multipole, such as a quadrupole, then perhaps the angular dependence is different. But the problem mentions an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution. If the oscillation is such that the charge is moving along the z-axis, but the distribution remains spheroidal, then perhaps the dominant term is a quadrupole. Let's check.
An oscillating electric dipole is a charge distribution where positive and negative charges are moving in opposite directions, creating a dipole moment that changes with time. For a spheroidal distribution oscillating along the z-axis, the deformation might create a quadrupole moment. For example, if the spheroid is being compressed and expanded along the z-axis, this would lead to a changing quadrupole moment. In that case, the radiation would be quadrupole in nature.
If that's the case, then the angular dependence is (3cos2θ -1). If the intensity is proportional to (3cos2θ -1)^2, then at θ=0°, we get (3*1 -1)^2 = 4, which is the maximum. So A=4. Then at θ=30°, cosθ=√3/2, so cos2θ=3/4. Plugging in, (3*(3/4) -1)^2 = (9/4 -1)^2 = (5/4)^2 = 25/16. So the fraction compared to A is (25/16)/4 = 25/64 ≈ 0.39. None of the options match. Alternatively, maybe the function isn't squared. If it's just 3cos2θ -1, then the intensity is proportional to 3cos2θ -1. The maximum value is 2 (at θ=0°), so A=2. At θ=30°, 3*(3/4) -1 = 5/4. So the fraction is (5/4)/2 = 5/8. Again, no option. Therefore, this can't be the case. Alternatively, maybe the angular dependence is different. Wait, maybe the radiation is dipole-like but with a different orientation. If the oscillation is along the z-axis, but the radiation pattern is strongest in the equatorial plane (dipole), then the fraction at θ=30° would be sin2(30°) = 1/4, so 1/4 of A. Then if the dependence is lambda^-4 (dipole), the answer is B. Alternatively, if it's quadrupole, the angular dependence is different. But given the options, the possible answers involve either lambda^-4 (B and D), lambda^-6 (A), or lambda^-3 (C). Let's recall the λ dependence for different multipoles. For a dipole, the power radiated is proportional to ω^4, which is (2πc/λ)^4, so power ~ λ^-4. For a quadrupole, the power radiated is proportional to ω^6 (since quadrupole moment involves two derivatives, each contributing ω^2, and then the power is proportional to the square of that, so ω^6), so substituting ω = 2πc/λ, it would be ~ λ^-6. So for a quadrupole, the power per unit solid angle is proportional to λ^-6. So if the problem is a quadrupole, the λ dependence is lambda^-6, which is option A or C. If the angular dependence is (3cos2θ -1)^2, then at θ=30°, the value is (3*(3/4)-1)^2 = (5/4)^2 = 25/16. If the maximum is at θ=0°, which is 4, then the fraction is 25/64 ≈ 0.39, which isn't one of the options. Alternatively, maybe the maximum is normalized to A, so if the angular dependence is (3cos2θ -1)^2, the maximum is 4 (at θ=0°), so A=4. Then at θ=30°, it's 25/16, so the fraction is 25/64 ≈ 0.39. Not an option. Alternatively, maybe the angular dependence is (3cos2θ -1) without squaring it. Then the maximum is 2 (at θ=0°), and at θ=30°, it's 3*(3/4) -1 = 5/4, so the fraction is 5/8. Not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the quadrupole formula is different. Wait, maybe the angular dependence for quadrupole radiation is 3cos2θ + 1 or similar? Wait, Legendre polynomials for l=2: P2(x) = (1/2)(3x2 -1). So the angular dependence is P2(cosθ). So yes, it is 3cos2θ -1. So the radiation pattern would involve this. But when we square it for the intensity, it's (3cos2θ -1)^2. As mentioned earlier, this leads to a maximum at θ=0° of 4, and at θ=30°, 25/16. But none of the options support this. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum power A is at θ=0° for quadrupole radiation, and the fraction is 25/64, which is approximately 0.39, which is close to 3/8, but there's no option for that. The available fractions are 3/4, 1/4, 1/2. So perhaps the answer is not related to quadrupole. Therefore, likely, the problem is about dipole radiation, and there's a mistake in thinking. Let's reconsider dipole. If it's a dipole, the power per unit solid angle is proportional to sin2θ. So the maximum is at θ=90° (equatorial plane), which would be A. Then at θ=30°, sin2θ = (1/2)^2 = 1/4, so the power there is 1/4 of A. So the fraction is 1/4. Then the λ dependence: since it's dipole radiation, power per unit solid angle is proportional to ω^4 / λ^4. So f is proportional to 1/λ^4. Therefore, the answer is B: 1/4, lambda^-4. However, another thought: the question says "an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape". A spheroid is a sphere that is elongated or flattened along one axis. If the charge distribution is spheroidal and oscillating, perhaps the radiation is not dipole but quadrupole. However, an oscillating electric dipole can be formed by a pair of charges oscillating along a line. If the charge distribution is spheroidal and oscillating along the z-axis, perhaps this is similar to a spherical charge oscillating, which would not radiate dipole but maybe quadrupole. Wait, a single oscillating charge (accelerated charge) radiates dipole radiation. But if the charge distribution is spheroidal and oscillating, maybe the radiation is different. Wait, when a charge distribution is oscillated such that the dipole moment is oscillating, you get dipole radiation. If higher moments (quadrupole, octupole, etc.) are oscillating, you get higher multipole radiation. So if the spheroidal distribution is oscillating along the z-axis, such that the quadrupole moment is changing, then you get quadrupole radiation. But if it's a rigid spheroid oscillating back and forth, then that would be like a dipole oscillation. Wait, no. If the entire charge distribution is moving as a whole, even if it's spheroidal, then the radiation would be like a single accelerated charge, which is dipole radiation. However, if the charge distribution is oscillating in size or shape (expanding and contracting), then that can lead to higher multipole moments. For example, if a spheroidal distribution is changing its eccentricity (flattening and unflattening), that might lead to a changing quadrupole moment. But the problem states "an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis)". The word "oscillating" here could refer to the entire distribution moving back and forth (like a dipole), or the shape changing (like a quadrupole). Since the problem mentions "radiate at a wavelength λ", implying that the oscillation frequency determines the wavelength. If the charge distribution is oscillating along the z-axis, i.e., moving back and forth along z, then this is like an electric dipole oscillation, hence dipole radiation. If it's changing shape (expanding and contracting in some way), then higher multipoles. However, the problem says "which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis)". So the charge distribution is spheroidal, meaning it's symmetric around the z-axis. If it's oscillating, perhaps this refers to the entire distribution moving along the z-axis. But moving charges radiate, and an accelerated charge radiates as a dipole. So when you have a distribution moving as a whole with acceleration along z, each charge radiates as a dipole. However, for a symmetric distribution, the net dipole moment might be zero. Wait, but if the entire distribution is moving with acceleration along z, then each charge is contributing to a dipole moment. Wait, no. Accelerated charges radiate as dipoles, but the radiation from each charge adds up. If the distribution is spheroidal and symmetric, but moving along z, the dipole moment would be the sum of individual charges times their positions. If it's a neutral distribution (equal positive and negative charges), but displaced in a particular way. Wait, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, if the spheroid is a neutral insulator with oscillating charges (like a polarizable medium), the oscillation could be a dipole oscillation. For example, if the spheroid is being polarized along z, leading to a dipole moment oscillating at frequency ω, then it would radiate dipole radiation. Alternatively, if the polarization is quadropolar (the charges are oscillating in a way that the dipole moment is zero but the quadrupole moment is changing), then it's quadrupole radiation. Without more information, it's difficult. But given the options, the possible answers involve different λ dependencies. Dipole: λ^-4, Quadrupole: λ^-6. The answer options are A:3/4, λ^-6; B:1/4, λ^-4; C:1/4, λ^-3; D:1/2, λ^-4. If the problem is dipole radiation, answer B is plausible. If quadrupole, answer A or none. But since the charge distribution is spheroidal, maybe the radiation is quadrupole. Let's see. If the charge distribution is a prolate spheroid (elongated along z) and it's oscillating in size (getting longer and shorter), then the quadrupole moment would be changing. The quadrupole moment Q is defined as the traceless moment: Q_{ij} = ∫ [3x_i x_j - r2 δ_{ij}] ρ(r) dr. For a spheroid oscillating in size, this could lead to a time-dependent quadrupole moment. If the spheroid is changing its eccentricity (flattening and unflattening), that would modulate the quadrupole moment. So if the oscillation is in the shape (changing the spheroid into more spherical or more elongated), then the quadrupole moment oscillates, leading to quadrupole radiation. In that case, the angular dependence would be (3cos2θ -1). If the intensity is proportional to (3cos2θ -1)^2, then at θ=30°, as calculated before, the fraction is 25/64 ≈ 0.39. Not an option. Alternatively, if the intensity is proportional to |3cos2θ -1|, then at θ=30°, it's 5/4, maximum at θ=0° is 2, so the fraction is 5/8 ≈ 0.625. Not an option. Alternatively, if it's proportional to 3cos2θ -1 without absolute value, but since intensity can't be negative, maybe it's squared. But again, leading to 25/64. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the angular dependence is different. Wait, perhaps the spheroidal charge distribution leads to a different beaming of the radiation. Alternatively, maybe the answer is A: 3/4 and λ^-6. If the λ dependence is inverse sixth power, that suggests quadrupole radiation (since power for quadrupole is proportional to ω^6, and ω = 2πc / λ, so ω^6 ~ λ^-6). So the λ dependence would be λ^-6 for quadrupole. Then the angular dependence: maybe for quadrupole, the intensity is proportional to (3cos2θ -1)^2. At θ=30°, (3*(3/4) -1)^2 = (5/4)^2 = 25/16. The maximum intensity is at θ=0°, which is (3*1 -1)^2 = 4. So the fraction is (25/16)/4 = 25/64 ≈ 0.39. Not 3/4. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the beaming of the quadrupole radiation. Wait, the standard quadrupole pattern has two lobes along the axis and a node in the equatorial plane. If the intensity is (3cos2θ -1)^2, then the fraction at θ=30° is 25/64, which is about 39% of the maximum. Not 3/4 or 1/2 or 1/4. Alternatively, maybe the problem considers a different kind of oscillation. For example, if the spheroid is oscillating in such a way that both dipole and quadrupole moments are present. But without more information, it's difficult. Alternatively, maybe the answer is B: 1/4, λ^-4. If the problem assumes dipole radiation, then yes. The power per unit solid angle is proportional to sin2θ. So at θ=30°, sin2θ = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So the power there is 1/4 of the maximum, which is at θ=90°. The λ dependence for dipole is λ^-4. So answer B matches. But why then is the spheroid mentioned? A dipole can be any oscillating charge distribution with a dipole moment. If the charge is spheroidal and oscillating along the axis, that's equivalent to a dipole. Maybe the shape being spheroidal doesn't affect it being a dipole. For example, even a spherical distribution moving as a whole would not radiate, but if it's deformed into a spheroid and oscillating, maybe that deformation creates a dipole moment. Wait, a spheroid is a distribution elongated along or squashed along an axis. If the charge distribution is a prolate spheroid (elongated) oscillating along the long axis, that might correspond to a dipole. Alternatively, if it's an oblate spheroid (flattened along the axis) oscillating, that might also correspond to a dipole. Alternatively, the deformation due to the oscillation could lead to a quadrupole moment. But perhaps in the problem's context, the radiation is considered as a quadrupole. However, given the options, if we consider B as a possible answer, and given that the default for an oscillating charge is dipole radiation, then answer B would make sense. But quadrupole radiation has λ^-6. If the problem is about quadrupole, then the answer would be A or C. Option A says 3/4 and λ^-6. If the angular dependence is (3cos2θ -1)^2, which at θ=30° is 25/16, which is divided by the maximum of 4, giving 25/64 ≈ 0.39, which is not 3/4. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the angular dependence is (3cos2θ) squared, but no, the proper quadrupole formula includes the -1 term. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the static case or something else. Wait, maybe the oscillating spheroid radiates as a magnetic dipole? But magnetic dipole radiation is different, and usually, charges radiate electric dipole radiation. Magnetic dipole radiation is from time-varying magnetic dipoles, which involve circulating currents. But here, an oscillating charge distribution (presumably moving charges back and forth), which would create an electric dipole field. Therefore, likely, the answer is B. But the mention of spheroid is throwing me off. Wait, a spheroid is a deformed sphere. If the charge distribution is a spheroid oscillating along the symmetry axis, maybe the radiation is not dipolar. For a spherical charge distribution, moving as a whole doesn't radiate (if rigid). But if it's oscillating, changing its shape, then it could radiate. For example, if the sphere is being compressed and expanded along the z-axis, creating a spheroidal shape that oscillates, then this is a change in the quadrupole moment, leading to quadrupole radiation. In that case, the angular dependence is (3cos2θ -1)^2. But as we saw, the fraction at θ=30° is not matching any of the given fractions. However, the problem states "the maximum power thus radiated is A". So if A is the maximum power, and the function f(λ, θ) is such that at θ=30°, it's a fraction of A. If the answer is A: 3/4, then the function would have to evaluate to 3/4*A at θ=30°. If the angular dependence is (3cos2θ -1) raised to some power... Alternatively, maybe the function is normalized differently. Suppose the intensity is proportional to (3cos2θ -1)^2 + const or something. Alternatively, maybe the problem is using a different formula. Wait, in some contexts, the intensity for quadrupole radiation is proportional to (3cos2θ +1)^2. But Legendre polynomial P2 is (3cos2θ -1)/2. But the radiation function would involve P2, so (3cos2θ -1). But if someone forgets the normalization, they might use 3cos2θ +1. Let's check. If the angular dependence is 3cos2θ +1. Then at θ=30°, 3*(3/4) +1= 9/4 +1=13/4. The maximum would be at θ=0°: 3*1 +1=4. So the fraction is (13/4)/4=13/16≈0.8125. Not an option. Alternatively, 3cos2θ. At θ=30°, 3*(3/4)=9/4. The maximum

okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. so, the question is about an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution radiating power in the radiation zone. we need to find the fraction of the maximum power a radiated at an angle θ = 30°, and also determine the angular dependence function f, which would tell us how the power per unit solid angle depends on λ and θ. the options are a through d, each giving a fraction and a λ dependence.
first, let me recall some concepts about radiation from oscillating charges. when a charge oscillates, it emits electromagnetic radiation. the power radiated depends on the acceleration of the charge. for a dipole radiator, the power radiated per unit solid angle has a well-known angular dependence of sin2θ. however, the problem here is a spheroidal charge distribution oscillating. spheroidal shapes are like slightly flattened spheres, either prolate (like a american football) or oblate (like a frisbee). the symmetry axis is along the z-axis, so the oscillation is likely along this axis, making it a quadrupole or higher-order moment? but wait, oscillating charge distributions can radiate even as dipoles. wait, a changing dipole moment is a source of radiation. let me think. if the charge distribution is spheroidal, that might imply a quadrupole moment is present. but even a dipole can radiate. hmm. but the problem mentions the radiation zone, so we can use the formulas for the radiation field in the far zone.
the power radiated per unit solid angle for an oscillating electric dipole is given by:
dp/dω = ( ( (1/(4πε0)) * (e2 a2 / c6) ) * ( ( ( (sinθ)^3 ) / (8π) ) ) * something? wait, maybe i should recall the larmor formula. the total power radiated by an accelerating charge is p = (e2 a2)/(6πε0 c3). but for an oscillating dipole, the radiation pattern has a sin2θ dependence. wait, actually, the dipole radiation has a power per unit solid angle proportional to sin2θ. so if the maximum power is along the equator (θ = 90°), and zero along the axis (θ = 0° or 180°). but here, the charge distribution is spheroidal with symmetry along the z-axis. if it's oscillating, perhaps it's a quadrupole? quadrupole radiation falls off as 1/r2 instead of dipole's 1/r, but i need to recall the angular dependence. wait, maybe the angular dependence for a quadrupole is different. let me think. for a electric quadrupole, the potential is proportional to 1/r3, and the angular dependence is related to the legendre polynomials. the radiation field for a quadrupole would involve higher-order terms. specifically, the angular dependence for a quadrupole radiation is proportional to p2(cosθ), which is (3cos2θ -1). so the angular distribution would have a different pattern. the dipole is proportional to p1, which is cosθ, but squared gives cos2θ, which after some factor becomes sin2θ when you consider the radiation. wait, maybe i need to remember that the radiated power from a multipole moment l falls off as 1/r^(l+1) and the angular dependence involves p_l (legendre polynomials). for dipole, l=1, so 1/r2 and p1. for quadrupole, l=2, 1/r3 and p2.
but in the problem, the charge distribution is spheroidal. a spheroid is an ellipsoid with two axes equal. if it's oscillating along the symmetry axis (z-axis), perhaps this leads to a quadrupole moment. alternatively, if the oscillation is such that the charge distribution is changing its shape but保持对称 axis, maybe higher multipoles are involved. however, even for a spheroidal distribution, the dominant radiation might still be dipole or quadrupole. but the key point here is that the radiation's angular dependence is different for different multipoles. for a quadrupole, the angular dependence would be proportional to (3cos2θ -1). so the radiation pattern would have a different angular dependence than the dipole. the maximum of this would be when cos2θ is maximum, which is when cosθ = ±1, i.e., θ = 0° or 180°, so along the axis. but wait, the standard dipole radiation is strongest in the equatorial plane (θ=90°), whereas a quadrupole would have a different pattern.
but the problem states that the maximum power is a. so depending on whether it's a dipole or quadrupole, the maximum would occur at different angles. if the charge distribution is spheroidal and oscillating along the z-axis, perhaps the radiation is strongest along the equator, like a dipole, or along the axis, like a quadrupole.
but the answer options mention fractions of a at θ=30°. let's think. if it's a dipole, the power per unit solid angle is proportional to sin2θ. the maximum is at θ=90° (sinθ=1), so a occurs there. then at θ=30°, sinθ=1/2, so sin2θ=1/4. therefore, the power there would be 1/4 of a. but option b says 1/4, and option c says 1/4 as well. then the other part is the λ dependence. hmm. wait, but if it's a dipole radiation, the power depends on frequency as ω4, and wavelength as λ^-6. wait, let me recall larmor's formula. the power radiated by an accelerating charge is proportional to a2, which is (ω2 x0)^2 if the acceleration a = ω2 x0. so total power proportional to ω4. but for a dipole, the radiated power is proportional to (e2 a2)/c3, which would be proportional to ω4. then, since c = λν, and ω = 2πν = 2πc/λ. so replacing ω with 2πc/λ, ω4 becomes (2πc/λ)^4 = (2π)^4 c^4 /λ^4. therefore, power proportional to 1/λ^4. wait, but larmor formula gives total power proportional to ω4, which via c and λ would be 1/λ^4. but in the options, some have λ^-6 or λ^-3. for example, option a says λ^-6. so maybe dipole is λ^-4, and quadrupole would have different dependencies?
wait, for higher multipoles, the power radiated falls off more strongly with distance, but here we are talking about the radiated power per unit solid angle. for a multipole of order l, the power per unit solid angle is proportional to 1/r2 * (1/r)^(l+1), but in the radiation zone, the angular distribution is given by the legendre polynomial p_l(cosθ). however, the total power for higher multipoles would involve higher powers of the source's parameters. for example, a quadrupole moment q radiates power proportional to q2, which might involve (d2 dipole/dt2) or similar.
but perhaps the key difference is that for a quadrupole, the power radiated per unit solid angle would have an angular dependence of p2(cosθ) and a wavelength dependence scaling with ω^6? let me check. the angular pattern for quadrupole radiation is (3cos2θ - 1), so if the maximum of the radiation is along the axis (θ=0), then the value at θ=30° would be 3*(√3/2)^2 -1 = 3*(3/4) -1 = 9/4 -1 = 5/4. wait, but that's if the maximum is at θ=0. however, the problem says the maximum power is a. so if the angular dependence is (3cos2θ -1), the maximum would be where cos2θ is maximum, i.e., θ=0 or π. then the maximum value is 3*1 -1 = 2. so a=2, and at θ=30°, cosθ=√3/2, so cos2θ=3/4, so 3*(3/4) -1 = 9/4 -1 = 5/4. then the fraction would be (5/4)/2 = 5/8. but none of the options have 5/8. hmm. alternatively, maybe the angular dependence is different. alternatively, maybe the problem is not a quadrupole. let me consider other possibilities.
the charge distribution is spheroidal. a spheroid is generated by rotating an ellipse about one of its axes. if it's a prolate spheroid (like a rugby ball), it's elongated along the axis. if it's an oblate spheroid (like a disk), it's flattened along the axis. the oscillation is along the symmetry axis (z-axis). so if it's an oblate spheroid oscillating, the deformation would be along the z-axis, leading to a change in the quadrupole moment. therefore, this could be a source of quadrupole radiation.
if it's quadrupole radiation, then the angular dependence is (3cos2θ -1). the maximum value of this function is +2, occurring at θ=0° and 180°, and the minimum is -1 at θ=90°. however, the power radiated per unit solid angle is proportional to the square of the multipole moment, but for a quadrupole, the angular distribution is indeed (3cos2θ -1)^2? wait, no. let me clarify. the far-field electric and magnetic fields for a quadrupole involve the legendre polynomial p2(cosθ). specifically, the radiation field would go like p2(cosθ)/r. the power per unit solid angle (intensity) is proportional to |e|^2, so that would be proportional to (p2)^2 / r2. since the standard dipole power per unit solid angle is proportional to sin^2θ, which is (1 - cos^2θ), and for quadrupole, it would be (3cos2θ -1)^2. so, expanding that, 9cos^4θ -6cos2θ +1. so the angular distribution is a quartic function in cosθ. but the problem states that the radiated power per unit solid angle is a function f(λ, θ). the maximum power is a. so depending on the multipole moment, the maximum could be at a different angle. if the angular distribution is (3cos2θ -1)^2, then the maximum occurs where 3cos2θ -1 is maximized, i.e., cos2θ=1, so cosθ=±1, θ=0° or 180°. so the maximum intensity is at the poles, and the value there is (3*1 -1)^2 = 4, so 4*k, where k is some proportionality constant. the minimum would be at θ=90°, with value (3*0 -1)^2=1*k. so if the maximum power is a, then at θ=30°, cosθ=√3/2, so 3cos2θ -1 = 3*(3/4) -1 = 9/4 -1 = 5/4. so the intensity there would be (5/4)^2 = 25/16. therefore, the fraction compared to a is (25/16)/4 = 25/64 ≈ 0.39. hmm, 25/64 is approximately 0.39, which is roughly 39%. none of the options have this. so maybe this approach is incorrect.
alternatively, perhaps the problem is not about a quadrupole but a different type of source. let me think again. the charge distribution is spheroidal, with symmetry along the z-axis, oscillating. if the oscillation is such that the charge is moving back and forth along the z-axis, even though the distribution is spheroidal, perhaps the dominant term is a dipole. for example, if you have a spherical charge distribution oscillating as a dipole, you get standard dipole radiation. but a spheroidal distribution might have a quadrupole moment as well. however, the question may be assuming that the oscillation is such that the dominant term is a quadrupole. let's check.
alternatively, maybe the problem is related to the fact that the charge distribution is spheroidal, so the oscillation could lead to a different radiation pattern. but i need to recall that for an oscillating charge distribution, the radiated power in the dipole approximation is given by the standard formula:
p = (e2 ω4 a2)/(6π ε0 c3)
but for higher multipoles, the power radiated is higher order in the oscillation amplitude or frequency. however, if the problem is about the angular dependence, maybe the dominant term here is quadrupole. let's assume that.
if the angular dependence is (3cos2θ -1), then at θ=30°, as calculated earlier, the value is 5/4. but compared to the maximum value, which is 2, the ratio would be (5/4)/2 = 5/8 ≈ 0.625. none of the options have this either. so perhaps my assumption is wrong.
alternatively, maybe the oscillation is such that the charge distribution is oscillating in a way that creates a dipole field. for a oscillating electric dipole, the radiated power per unit solid angle is proportional to sin2θ. the maximum is at θ=90° (equatorial plane), which would correspond to a. then at θ=30°, sinθ=1/2, so sin2θ=1/4. therefore, the power there is 1/4 of a, which is option b and c's first part. then the λ dependence: for dipole radiation, power is proportional to ω^4, and since ω = 2πc/λ, substituting gives power proportional to (1/λ^4). so the function f would include a λ^-4 term. so then the answer would be b or d. but option d says 1/2, which isn't sin2theta at 30°, so the answer would be b. however, the possible form of f is lambda^-4. but in the options, a is lambda^-6, b is lambda^-4, c is lambda^-3, d is lambda^-4. so if it's dipole radiation, then the power per unit solid angle is proportional to 1/λ^4 (since power goes as ω^4 and omega is 2pi c / lambda, so omega^4 is proportional to 1/lambda^4). therefore, the function f would be proportional to 1/lambda^4. so that's the second part. then, combining this, the fraction is 1/4 and lambda^-4, which is option b. alternatively, if the answer is b, let me check again. but wait, the problem states "the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of λ and the angle θ". so f has dependence on both λ and θ. for dipole radiation, the power per unit solid angle is proportional to (ω^4)/r2 times sin2θ. since ω=2πc/λ, then replacing ω, the power per unit solid angle is proportional to ( (2πc/λ)^4 ) / r2 * sin2θ. but in the radiation zone, r is the distance from the source, but since we are considering the intensity (power per unit solid angle), r2 is factored out. therefore, the intensity is proportional to (2πc/λ)^4 * sin2θ. so the intensity as a function of λ and θ is ~ λ^-4 sin2θ. therefore, f(λ,θ) = k * sin2θ / λ^4, where k is a constant. therefore, the maximum value a would be at sinθ=1 (θ=90°), so a = k / λ^4. then, at θ=30°, sinθ=1/2, so the power is (k / λ^4) * (1/4). so the fraction compared to a is 1/4, and the function f is proportional to λ^-4. so the correct answer would be b) 1/4, lambda^-4.
but wait, the options say "the fraction of a that will be radiated at an angle θ = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively," so the first part is the fraction (1/4) and the second part is the form of f (lambda^-4). so answer b. but wait, another thought: if the charge distribution is spheroidal, maybe the radiation isn't dipolar. if it's a higher multipole, such as a quadrupole, then perhaps the angular dependence is different. but the problem mentions an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution. if the oscillation is such that the charge is moving along the z-axis, but the distribution remains spheroidal, then perhaps the dominant term is a quadrupole. let's check.
an oscillating electric dipole is a charge distribution where positive and negative charges are moving in opposite directions, creating a dipole moment that changes with time. for a spheroidal distribution oscillating along the z-axis, the deformation might create a quadrupole moment. for example, if the spheroid is being compressed and expanded along the z-axis, this would lead to a changing quadrupole moment. in that case, the radiation would be quadrupole in nature.
if that's the case, then the angular dependence is (3cos2θ -1). if the intensity is proportional to (3cos2θ -1)^2, then at θ=0°, we get (3*1 -1)^2 = 4, which is the maximum. so a=4. then at θ=30°, cosθ=√3/2, so cos2θ=3/4. plugging in, (3*(3/4) -1)^2 = (9/4 -1)^2 = (5/4)^2 = 25/16. so the fraction compared to a is (25/16)/4 = 25/64 ≈ 0.39. none of the options match. alternatively, maybe the function isn't squared. if it's just 3cos2θ -1, then the intensity is proportional to 3cos2θ -1. the maximum value is 2 (at θ=0°), so a=2. at θ=30°, 3*(3/4) -1 = 5/4. so the fraction is (5/4)/2 = 5/8. again, no option. therefore, this can't be the case. alternatively, maybe the angular dependence is different. wait, maybe the radiation is dipole-like but with a different orientation. if the oscillation is along the z-axis, but the radiation pattern is strongest in the equatorial plane (dipole), then the fraction at θ=30° would be sin2(30°) = 1/4, so 1/4 of a. then if the dependence is lambda^-4 (dipole), the answer is b. alternatively, if it's quadrupole, the angular dependence is different. but given the options, the possible answers involve either lambda^-4 (b and d), lambda^-6 (a), or lambda^-3 (c). let's recall the λ dependence for different multipoles. for a dipole, the power radiated is proportional to ω^4, which is (2πc/λ)^4, so power ~ λ^-4. for a quadrupole, the power radiated is proportional to ω^6 (since quadrupole moment involves two derivatives, each contributing ω^2, and then the power is proportional to the square of that, so ω^6), so substituting ω = 2πc/λ, it would be ~ λ^-6. so for a quadrupole, the power per unit solid angle is proportional to λ^-6. so if the problem is a quadrupole, the λ dependence is lambda^-6, which is option a or c. if the angular dependence is (3cos2θ -1)^2, then at θ=30°, the value is (3*(3/4)-1)^2 = (5/4)^2 = 25/16. if the maximum is at θ=0°, which is 4, then the fraction is 25/64 ≈ 0.39, which isn't one of the options. alternatively, maybe the maximum is normalized to a, so if the angular dependence is (3cos2θ -1)^2, the maximum is 4 (at θ=0°), so a=4. then at θ=30°, it's 25/16, so the fraction is 25/64 ≈ 0.39. not an option. alternatively, maybe the angular dependence is (3cos2θ -1) without squaring it. then the maximum is 2 (at θ=0°), and at θ=30°, it's 3*(3/4) -1 = 5/4, so the fraction is 5/8. not an option. alternatively, perhaps the quadrupole formula is different. wait, maybe the angular dependence for quadrupole radiation is 3cos2θ + 1 or similar? wait, legendre polynomials for l=2: p2(x) = (1/2)(3x2 -1). so the angular dependence is p2(cosθ). so yes, it is 3cos2θ -1. so the radiation pattern would involve this. but when we square it for the intensity, it's (3cos2θ -1)^2. as mentioned earlier, this leads to a maximum at θ=0° of 4, and at θ=30°, 25/16. but none of the options support this. alternatively, perhaps the maximum power a is at θ=0° for quadrupole radiation, and the fraction is 25/64, which is approximately 0.39, which is close to 3/8, but there's no option for that. the available fractions are 3/4, 1/4, 1/2. so perhaps the answer is not related to quadrupole. therefore, likely, the problem is about dipole radiation, and there's a mistake in thinking. let's reconsider dipole. if it's a dipole, the power per unit solid angle is proportional to sin2θ. so the maximum is at θ=90° (equatorial plane), which would be a. then at θ=30°, sin2θ = (1/2)^2 = 1/4, so the power there is 1/4 of a. so the fraction is 1/4. then the λ dependence: since it's dipole radiation, power per unit solid angle is proportional to ω^4 / λ^4. so f is proportional to 1/λ^4. therefore, the answer is b: 1/4, lambda^-4. however, another thought: the question says "an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape". a spheroid is a sphere that is elongated or flattened along one axis. if the charge distribution is spheroidal and oscillating, perhaps the radiation is not dipole but quadrupole. however, an oscillating electric dipole can be formed by a pair of charges oscillating along a line. if the charge distribution is spheroidal and oscillating along the z-axis, perhaps this is similar to a spherical charge oscillating, which would not radiate dipole but maybe quadrupole. wait, a single oscillating charge (accelerated charge) radiates dipole radiation. but if the charge distribution is spheroidal and oscillating, maybe the radiation is different. wait, when a charge distribution is oscillated such that the dipole moment is oscillating, you get dipole radiation. if higher moments (quadrupole, octupole, etc.) are oscillating, you get higher multipole radiation. so if the spheroidal distribution is oscillating along the z-axis, such that the quadrupole moment is changing, then you get quadrupole radiation. but if it's a rigid spheroid oscillating back and forth, then that would be like a dipole oscillation. wait, no. if the entire charge distribution is moving as a whole, even if it's spheroidal, then the radiation would be like a single accelerated charge, which is dipole radiation. however, if the charge distribution is oscillating in size or shape (expanding and contracting), then that can lead to higher multipole moments. for example, if a spheroidal distribution is changing its eccentricity (flattening and unflattening), that might lead to a changing quadrupole moment. but the problem states "an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis)". the word "oscillating" here could refer to the entire distribution moving back and forth (like a dipole), or the shape changing (like a quadrupole). since the problem mentions "radiate at a wavelength λ", implying that the oscillation frequency determines the wavelength. if the charge distribution is oscillating along the z-axis, i.e., moving back and forth along z, then this is like an electric dipole oscillation, hence dipole radiation. if it's changing shape (expanding and contracting in some way), then higher multipoles. however, the problem says "which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis)". so the charge distribution is spheroidal, meaning it's symmetric around the z-axis. if it's oscillating, perhaps this refers to the entire distribution moving along the z-axis. but moving charges radiate, and an accelerated charge radiates as a dipole. so when you have a distribution moving as a whole with acceleration along z, each charge radiates as a dipole. however, for a symmetric distribution, the net dipole moment might be zero. wait, but if the entire distribution is moving with acceleration along z, then each charge is contributing to a dipole moment. wait, no. accelerated charges radiate as dipoles, but the radiation from each charge adds up. if the distribution is spheroidal and symmetric, but moving along z, the dipole moment would be the sum of individual charges times their positions. if it's a neutral distribution (equal positive and negative charges), but displaced in a particular way. wait, this is getting complicated. alternatively, if the spheroid is a neutral insulator with oscillating charges (like a polarizable medium), the oscillation could be a dipole oscillation. for example, if the spheroid is being polarized along z, leading to a dipole moment oscillating at frequency ω, then it would radiate dipole radiation. alternatively, if the polarization is quadropolar (the charges are oscillating in a way that the dipole moment is zero but the quadrupole moment is changing), then it's quadrupole radiation. without more information, it's difficult. but given the options, the possible answers involve different λ dependencies. dipole: λ^-4, quadrupole: λ^-6. the answer options are a:3/4, λ^-6; b:1/4, λ^-4; c:1/4, λ^-3; d:1/2, λ^-4. if the problem is dipole radiation, answer b is plausible. if quadrupole, answer a or none. but since the charge distribution is spheroidal, maybe the radiation is quadrupole. let's see. if the charge distribution is a prolate spheroid (elongated along z) and it's oscillating in size (getting longer and shorter), then the quadrupole moment would be changing. the quadrupole moment q is defined as the traceless moment: q_{ij} = ∫ [3x_i x_j - r2 δ_{ij}] ρ(r) dr. for a spheroid oscillating in size, this could lead to a time-dependent quadrupole moment. if the spheroid is changing its eccentricity (flattening and unflattening), that would modulate the quadrupole moment. so if the oscillation is in the shape (changing the spheroid into more spherical or more elongated), then the quadrupole moment oscillates, leading to quadrupole radiation. in that case, the angular dependence would be (3cos2θ -1). if the intensity is proportional to (3cos2θ -1)^2, then at θ=30°, as calculated before, the fraction is 25/64 ≈ 0.39. not an option. alternatively, if the intensity is proportional to |3cos2θ -1|, then at θ=30°, it's 5/4, maximum at θ=0° is 2, so the fraction is 5/8 ≈ 0.625. not an option. alternatively, if it's proportional to 3cos2θ -1 without absolute value, but since intensity can't be negative, maybe it's squared. but again, leading to 25/64. hmm. alternatively, maybe the angular dependence is different. wait, perhaps the spheroidal charge distribution leads to a different beaming of the radiation. alternatively, maybe the answer is a: 3/4 and λ^-6. if the λ dependence is inverse sixth power, that suggests quadrupole radiation (since power for quadrupole is proportional to ω^6, and ω = 2πc / λ, so ω^6 ~ λ^-6). so the λ dependence would be λ^-6 for quadrupole. then the angular dependence: maybe for quadrupole, the intensity is proportional to (3cos2θ -1)^2. at θ=30°, (3*(3/4) -1)^2 = (5/4)^2 = 25/16. the maximum intensity is at θ=0°, which is (3*1 -1)^2 = 4. so the fraction is (25/16)/4 = 25/64 ≈ 0.39. not 3/4. alternatively, maybe the question is considering the beaming of the quadrupole radiation. wait, the standard quadrupole pattern has two lobes along the axis and a node in the equatorial plane. if the intensity is (3cos2θ -1)^2, then the fraction at θ=30° is 25/64, which is about 39% of the maximum. not 3/4 or 1/2 or 1/4. alternatively, maybe the problem considers a different kind of oscillation. for example, if the spheroid is oscillating in such a way that both dipole and quadrupole moments are present. but without more information, it's difficult. alternatively, maybe the answer is b: 1/4, λ^-4. if the problem assumes dipole radiation, then yes. the power per unit solid angle is proportional to sin2θ. so at θ=30°, sin2θ = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. so the power there is 1/4 of the maximum, which is at θ=90°. the λ dependence for dipole is λ^-4. so answer b matches. but why then is the spheroid mentioned? a dipole can be any oscillating charge distribution with a dipole moment. if the charge is spheroidal and oscillating along the axis, that's equivalent to a dipole. maybe the shape being spheroidal doesn't affect it being a dipole. for example, even a spherical distribution moving as a whole would not radiate, but if it's deformed into a spheroid and oscillating, maybe that deformation creates a dipole moment. wait, a spheroid is a distribution elongated along or squashed along an axis. if the charge distribution is a prolate spheroid (elongated) oscillating along the long axis, that might correspond to a dipole. alternatively, if it's an oblate spheroid (flattened along the axis) oscillating, that might also correspond to a dipole. alternatively, the deformation due to the oscillation could lead to a quadrupole moment. but perhaps in the problem's context, the radiation is considered as a quadrupole. however, given the options, if we consider b as a possible answer, and given that the default for an oscillating charge is dipole radiation, then answer b would make sense. but quadrupole radiation has λ^-6. if the problem is about quadrupole, then the answer would be a or c. option a says 3/4 and λ^-6. if the angular dependence is (3cos2θ -1)^2, which at θ=30° is 25/16, which is divided by the maximum of 4, giving 25/64 ≈ 0.39, which is not 3/4. so that doesn't fit. alternatively, maybe the angular dependence is (3cos2θ) squared, but no, the proper quadrupole formula includes the -1 term. alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the static case or something else. wait, maybe the oscillating spheroid radiates as a magnetic dipole? but magnetic dipole radiation is different, and usually, charges radiate electric dipole radiation. magnetic dipole radiation is from time-varying magnetic dipoles, which involve circulating currents. but here, an oscillating charge distribution (presumably moving charges back and forth), which would create an electric dipole field. therefore, likely, the answer is b. but the mention of spheroid is throwing me off. wait, a spheroid is a deformed sphere. if the charge distribution is a spheroid oscillating along the symmetry axis, maybe the radiation is not dipolar. for a spherical charge distribution, moving as a whole doesn't radiate (if rigid). but if it's oscillating, changing its shape, then it could radiate. for example, if the sphere is being compressed and expanded along the z-axis, creating a spheroidal shape that oscillates, then this is a change in the quadrupole moment, leading to quadrupole radiation. in that case, the angular dependence is (3cos2θ -1)^2. but as we saw, the fraction at θ=30° is not matching any of the given fractions. however, the problem states "the maximum power thus radiated is a". so if a is the maximum power, and the function f(λ, θ) is such that at θ=30°, it's a fraction of a. if the answer is a: 3/4, then the function would have to evaluate to 3/4*a at θ=30°. if the angular dependence is (3cos2θ -1) raised to some power... alternatively, maybe the function is normalized differently. suppose the intensity is proportional to (3cos2θ -1)^2 + const or something. alternatively, maybe the problem is using a different formula. wait, in some contexts, the intensity for quadrupole radiation is proportional to (3cos2θ +1)^2. but legendre polynomial p2 is (3cos2θ -1)/2. but the radiation function would involve p2, so (3cos2θ -1). but if someone forgets the normalization, they might use 3cos2θ +1. let's check. if the angular dependence is 3cos2θ +1. then at θ=30°, 3*(3/4) +1= 9/4 +1=13/4. the maximum would be at θ=0°: 3*1 +1=4. so the fraction is (13/4)/4=13/16≈0.8125. not an option. alternatively, 3cos2θ. at θ=30°, 3*(3/4)=9/4. the maximum
