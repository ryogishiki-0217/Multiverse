Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about a quasar observed in the near infrared and optical spectrum with a peak at 790 nm, and then a significant drop in flux at shorter wavelengths. We need to estimate the comoving distance of this quasar from Earth given the Lambda-CDM model parameters: Hubble constant H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, matter density parameter Ω_m = 0.3, dark energy density parameter Ω_Λ = 0.7, and the universe is flat.
The options are 9 Gpc, 8 Gpc, 7 Gpc, or 6 Gpc.
First, I need to recall what comoving distance is.
Comoving distance is the distance between two objects in the universe, measured along the path that would be taken if the universe were not expanding.
It essentially factors out the expansion of the universe and gives a kind of "static" distance.
For a flat universe, the comoving distance can be calculated using the integral of the scale factor over the history of the universe, divided by the speed of light.
But wait, the problem mentions the current scale factor a=1.
So, the comoving distance at a=1 is the same as the comoving distance we calculate today, right?
So, we need to compute the comoving distance to the quasar based on the given cosmological parameters and the observation of the peak wavelength.
But how do we connect the peak wavelength to the distance?
The key here might be the Lyman-alpha forest and the Lyman-alpha forest's characteristic wavelength.
Wait, quasars often show absorption lines due to intervening gas clouds, and the Lyman-alpha transition (for hydrogen) occurs at a rest wavelength of about 1216 nm.
However, the problem mentions a peak at 790 nm.
Wait, 790 nm is in the near-infrared (about 0.79 μm).
If there's a peak at 790 nm and a drop at shorter wavelengths (i.e., bluer than 790 nm), that might correspond to a cutoff or a feature in the quasar's spectrum.
One possibility is the Lyman-alpha forest.
The Lyman-alpha forest is a series of absorption lines seen in the spectra of distant quasars, caused by neutral hydrogen gas in the intergalactic medium.
These lines are blueshifted relative to the quasar's rest frame, and the density of these lines increases as you go to longer wavelengths (i.e., redder) in the observed spectrum.
However, I need to recall if there's a characteristic wavelength related to the Lyman-alpha forest that would cause a peak in the flux at a certain observed wavelength.
Alternatively, maybe this peak is related to the so-called "proximity effect" where near the quasar, the intergalactic medium is ionized, reducing absorption.
However, the problem states that at wavelengths shorter than 790 nm, the flux drops significantly.
That suggests a cutoff or a break in the spectrum at 790 nm.
Wait, another thought: the Lyman-alpha forest can cause a Gunn-Peterson trough.
The Gunn-Peterson effect predicts that in a neutral intergalactic medium, the observed flux shortward of the Lyman-alpha emission line (which would be at a wavelength corresponding to the quasar's redshift) would be suppressed due to absorption by neutral hydrogen.
If the quasar's spectrum shows a drop in flux below 790 nm, this might indicate that the Lyman-alpha forest is becoming very opaque at wavelengths shorter than 790 nm.
The rest frame wavelength of the Lyman-alpha transition is 1216 nm.
But the observed wavelength is related to the rest frame wavelength by (observed wavelength) = (1 + z) * (rest wavelength).
If the observed wavelength is 790 nm, and the rest wavelength for Lyman-alpha is 1216 nm, then (1 + z) = (observed wavelength) / (rest wavelength) = 790 nm / 1216 nm ≈ 0.65.
Wait, but that would give z ≈ -0.35, which is impossible because redshift can't be negative.
Wait, maybe I have that backward.
Wait, let me think again.
The rest frame wavelength of the Gunn-Peterson trough would be the Lyman-alpha wavelength (1216 Å), but if the observed wavelength is 790 nm, then the relationship between observed wavelength (λ_obs), emitted wavelength (λ_emit), and redshift z is λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + z).
So, solving for z, we have z = (λ_obs / λ_emit) - 1.
But wait, if λ_emit is 1216 Å (which is 121.6 nm), and λ_obs is 790 nm, then z = (790 nm / 121.6 nm) - 1 ≈ (6.5) - 1 = 5.5.
Wait, that would give a redshift z ≈ 5.5.
But if that's the case, then the quasar is at z ≈ 5.5, and we need to compute the comoving distance to this redshift in a Lambda-CDM universe with H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, Ω_m = 0.3, Ω_Λ = 0.7 (and flat, so Ω_k = 0).
So the next step is to calculate the comoving distance for a source at redshift z = 5.5 in such a universe.
But wait, hold on.
Let me make sure that this connection is correct.
If the Gunn-Peterson trough is observed at λ_obs = 790 nm for the Lyman-alpha transition (which is at 1216 Å in the rest frame), then yes, z ≈ 5.5.
But why is there a peak at 790 nm?
The flux drops at shorter wavelengths (i.e., higher energy), which would correspond to the trough.
Wait, perhaps the peak is at 790 nm because that's where the flux starts dropping due to the Gunn-Peterson trough.
So the peak would be just redward of the trough.
Alternatively, maybe the peak is the Lyman-alpha emission line of the quasar itself.
Wait, quasars do emit a bright Lyman-alpha line, but if the observed peak is at 790 nm, then the emission line would be redshifted.
Let's check.
If the rest wavelength is 1216 Å (0.1216 nm), and the observed wavelength is 790 nm, then z = (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1 = (790 nm / 0.1216 nm) - 1.
That would be enormous, like z = 6000.
That's not possible.
Wait, that suggests a miscalculation.
Wait, 1216 Å is 121.6 nm.
Ah, 1216 Å = 0.1216 nm?
No, wait: 1 nm = 10 Å.
So 1216 Å is 121.6 nm.
So correct.
So if the rest wavelength is 121.6 nm, and the observed wavelength is 790 nm, then z = (790 / 121.6) -1 ≈ 6.5 -1 = 5.5.
So redshift z ≈ 5.5.
Alternatively, if the quasar's Lyman-alpha emission line is observed at 790 nm, then z ≈ 5.5.
But the question is about the comoving distance of the quasar.
To compute the comoving distance, we need to integrate the scale factor over the time since the light was emitted until now.
The formula for comoving distance is:
$$
D_{\text{comov}} = c \int_0^z \frac{dz'}{H(z')}
$$
where H(z) is the Hubble parameter as a function of redshift.
In a flat Lambda-CDM universe, the Hubble parameter is given by:
$$
H(z) = H_0 \sqrt{\Omega_{m}(1+z)^3 + \Omega_{\Lambda}}
$$
Given the parameters: H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, Ωm = 0.3, ΩΛ = 0.7.
So we need to compute the integral:
$$
D_{\text{comov}} = \frac{c}{H_0} \int_0^5.5 \frac{dz}{\sqrt{\Omega_{m}(1+z)^3 + \Omega_{\Lambda}}}
$$
Note that c is in units of km/s, so the comoving distance will come out in Mpc.
But since the answer choices are in Gpc, we need to convert units appropriately.
First, let me compute the integral numerically.
However, since I can't perform numerical integrations here, I can recall approximate comoving distance-redshift relations.
Alternatively, use the approximation for high redshift.
For z >> 1, the comoving distance can be approximated as:
$$
D_{\text{comov}} \approx \frac{c}{H_0 \sqrt{\Omega_m}} \left[ \sqrt{\frac{\Omega_m}{\Omega_\Lambda}} \tanh^{-1} \left( \sqrt{ \frac{\Omega_\Lambda}{\Omega_m (1+z)^3 + \Omega_\Lambda} } \right) \right]
$$
But this might be complicated.
Alternatively, refer to standard values.
Let's think in parallel.

1: For a flat universe, the comoving distance can be approximated using the formula D_comov ≈ (c/H0) * (2/3) * z for z << 1. This approximation is not suitable for high redshifts. For z=5.5, a different approximation is needed. The formula D_comov ≈ (c/H0) * (2/3) * z is not applicable for z=5.5. A more accurate approach is required for high redshifts. At high redshifts, dark energy becomes less dominant. At z=5.5, the term (1+z)^3 in the Hubble parameter H(z) = H0 * sqrt(Ωm*(1+z)^3 + ΩΛ) becomes (1+5.5)^3 = 6.5^3 ≈ 274.625. With Ωm = 0.3 and ΩΛ = 0.7, the Hubble parameter at z=5.5 is H(z) ≈ H0 * sqrt(0.3 * 274.625 + 0.7) ≈ H0 * sqrt(82.3875 + 0.7) ≈ H0 * sqrt(83.0875) ≈ H0 * 9.115. The integrand dz/H(z) becomes approximately 1/(9.115 * H0).
The integral of dz from 0 to z over H(z) is approximated by integrating from 0 to z over [H0 * 9.115]. The integral ∫0^z [1/(9.115 H0)] dz' is approximately z/(9.115 H0).
The product of the speed of light c and this integral yields D_comov ≈ c * [z / (9.115 H0)].
With H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, this approximation is used.
The speed of light c is approximately 3 x 10^5 km/s.
The term c/H0 is approximately (3 x 10^5 km/s) / (70 km/s/Mpc) ≈ 4285.7 Mpc.
The comoving distance D_comov is approximated by D_comov ≈ (4285.7 Mpc) * (5.5 / 9.115) ).
The factor (5.5 / 9.115) is approximately 0.603.
The product 4285.7 Mpc * 0.603 is approximately 2583 Mpc.
The result of 2583 Mpc is converted to Gpc.
2583 Mpc is approximately 2.583 Gpc.
This approximation is considered rough.
A more accurate method is needed.

At high redshifts, dark energy becomes less dominant. At z=5.5, the Hubble parameter H(z) is calculated using the formula H(z) = H0 * sqrt(Ωm*(1+z)^3 + ΩΛ). For Ωm = 0.3, ΩΛ = 0.7, and z=5.5, (1+z)^3 is (1+5.5)^3 = 6.5^3 ≈ 274.625. The term Ωm*(1+z)^3 becomes 0.3 * 274.625 ≈ 82.3875. The term ΩΛ is 0.7. The Hubble parameter H(z) is then H0 * sqrt(82.3875 + 0.7) ≈ H0 * sqrt(83.0875) ≈ H0 * 9.111. The H(z) value is approximately 9.111 * H0. The integral for comoving distance involves 1/H(z), which is approximately 1/(9.111 * H0).
The integral ∫0^z [1/(9.111 * H0)] dz' is approximately z/(9.111 * H0).
The product of the speed of light c and this integral yields D_comov ≈ c * [z / (9.111 * H0)].
With H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, this approximation is used.
The speed of light c is approximately 3 x 10^5 km/s.
The term c/H0 is approximately (3 x 10^5 km/s) / (70 km/s/Mpc) ≈ 4285.7 Mpc.
The comoving distance D_comov is approximated by D_comov ≈ (4285.7 Mpc) * (5.5 / 9.111).
The factor (5.5 / 9.111) is approximately 0.603.
The product 4285.7 Mpc * 0.603 is approximately 2583 Mpc.
The result of 2583 Mpc is converted to Gpc.
2583 Mpc is approximately 2.583 Gpc.

<Conclusion>
The approximate comoving distance for z=5.5 was calculated as about 2.583 Gpc. The approximate comoving distance for z=6 was calculated as about 3 Gpc.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
But according to the standard comoving distance for z=6 is about 3000 Mpc or 3 Gpc.
Wait, but this is contradictory.
Alternatively, perhaps use a more precise method.
Let me recall that the comoving distance for a flat universe is given by:
$$
D_{\text{comov}} = \frac{c}{H_0} \int_0^z \frac{dz'}{\sqrt{\Omega_m (1+z')^3 + \Omega_\Lambda}}
$$
For H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, Ωm = 0.3, ΩΛ = 0.7.
Let me convert H0 to units of (km/s)/Mpc to 1/Gyr.
The speed of light c is approximately 3 x 10^5 km/s.
So, c / H0 ≈ (3 x 10^5 km/s) / (70 km/s/Mpc) ≈ 4285.7 Mpc.
Then, the integral part is the dimensionless part.
Let me consider z = 5.5.
The integral ∫0^5.5 [1 / sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 + 0.7)] dz'.
This integral is not straightforward, but perhaps we can approximate it.
At high z, the term 0.3*(1+z')^3 dominates over 0.7, so the integral becomes approximately ∫0^5.5 [1 / sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3)] dz'.
Let’s compute that:
sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3) = (1+z')^(3/2) * sqrt(0.3)
So the integrand becomes 1 / [(1+z')^(3/2) * sqrt(0.3)]
Thus, the integral simplifies to 1 / sqrt(0.3) ∫0^5.5 (1+z')^(-3/2) dz'
Integrate (1+z')^(-3/2) from 0 to 5.5:
The integral of (1+z')^(-3/2) dz' is -2*(1+z')^(-1/2)
Evaluated from 0 to 5.5:
-2[(1+5.5)^(-1/2) - (1+0)^(-1/2)] = -2[(7.5^(-1/2)) - (1)^(-1/2)] = -2[(1/√7.5) - 1]
Calculate:
√7.5 ≈ 2.7386
So 1/√7.5 ≈ 0.3651
Thus, -2[0.3651 - 1] = -2[-0.6349] ≈ 1.2698
Multiply by 1/sqrt(0.3):
sqrt(0.3) ≈ 0.5477
So 1 / 0.5477 ≈ 1.826
Thus, the integral ≈ 1.826 * 1.2698 ≈ 2.319
Thus, the comoving distance D_comov ≈ 4285.7 Mpc * 2.319 ≈ 4285.7 * 2.319 ≈ 10,000 Mpc ≈ 10 Gpc.
But this is way off since previous estimates for z=6 were 3 Gpc.
Clearly, this approximation is not valid.
Wait, but where is the mistake here?
Wait, if I use the approximation that at high z, the integral is dominated by the matter term, but we need to check when the dark energy starts to become significant.
Alternatively, maybe a better approach is to note that for a given set of cosmological parameters, comoving distance scales with certain relations.
Alternatively, perhaps use the relation between angular diameter distance, which is D_A = D_comov / (1+z).
But the question is about comoving distance.
Alternatively, perhaps use the luminosity distance, which for expansion is D_L = (1+z) D_comov.
Wait, but how does this help?
Wait, but since the problem refers to flux observations, maybe there's a connection through the flux-distance relation, but the problem does not provide flux values, just a description of the spectrum.
So probably not necessary.
Wait, going back.
The problem states that in the observed spectrum, there's a peak at 790 nm, and a drop at shorter wavelengths.
If this peak is due to the Lyman-alpha forest becoming opaque, then the observed wavelength of 790 nm would correspond to the Lyman-alpha rest frame wavelength (1216 Å) multiplied by (1+z).
So:
λ_obs = 790 nm = 1216 Å * (1+z)
Wait, but 1216 Å = 0.1216 nm, so 0.1216*(1+z) = 0.790 => (1+z) = 0.790 / 0.1216 ≈ 6.5, so z ≈ 5.5.
Therefore, the quasar is at redshift z ≈ 5.5.
Then, the comoving distance for z=5.5 in a Lambda-CDM model with H0=70, Ωm=0.3, ΩΛ=0.7.
Let me recall that for these parameters, the age of the universe at z=5.5 is roughly ... but perhaps instead look up or approximate the comoving distance.
Alternatively, use the approximation that the comoving distance for z >1 can be approximated by:
D_comov ≈ \frac{c}{H_0} \times \text{scale factor based on cosmological parameters}
For example, from cosmology resources, the comoving distance at z=5.5 for H0=70, Ωm=0.3, ΩΛ=0.7 is approximately 2200 Mpc.
Wait, but 2200 Mpc is 2.2 Gpc.
The options are 6,7,8,9 Gpc.
That can't be.
Wait, but this contradicts earlier thoughts.
Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the Lyman-alpha emission line but about the Lyman-alpha forest's effect on the quasar's spectrum.
If the quasar's continuum drops below 790 nm, that might indicate that this wavelength corresponds to the Lyman-alpha forest's opacity.
The actual rest-frame wavelength of the drop would be 1216 Å, so observed at 790 nm, implying z = (790 nm / 0.1216 nm) -1 = (790 / 12160) -1.
Wait, no.
Wait, 1216 Å is 121.6 nm.
So if the rest frame wavelength is 121.6 nm, and the observed wavelength is 790 nm, then z = (790 / 121.6) -1 ≈ 6.5 -1 = 5.5.
So yes, z=5.5.
So the quasar is at z=5.5.
Then, the comoving distance is calculated.
But previous approximated thought gives 2.2 Gpc, but options are higher.
Wait, maybe the confusion is between different distance measures?
Wait, sometimes people confuse comoving distance with angular diameter distance or luminosity distance.
But the question specifies comoving distance.
Wait, angular diameter distance is D_A = D_comov / (1+z), and luminosity distance is D_L = (1+z) D_comov.
But how is the comoving distance calculated?
Wait, perhaps another mistake: when converting H0 to proper units.
Let me redo the calculation step by step.
Given H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc.
The speed of light c = 3 x 10^5 km/s.
Thus, the Hubble time is c / H0.
Compute that:
c / H0 = (3 x 10^5 km/s) / (70 km/s/Mpc) = (3 x 10^5)/70 Mpc ≈ 4285.71 Mpc.
So c / H0 ≈ 4.2857 Gpc (since 1 Gpc = 10^3 Mpc).
Now, the comoving distance integral is:
D_comov = (c / H0) * ∫0^z [1 / sqrt(Ωm (1 + z')^3 + ΩΛ)] dz'
With z =5.5, Ωm=0.3, ΩΛ=0.7.
But integrating this function requires either numerical methods or looking up values.
Alternatively, use approximations.
For a flat universe, there is an analytic expression for the integral.
The integral for the comoving distance in a flat universe (Ω_total=1) is:
D_comov = (c / H0) * [√(ΩΛ) / 3 H0] * F(z; Ωm, ΩΛ)
Where F is some function.
Wait, actually, according to the formulae, in a flat universe, the integral can be expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions or approximated.
Alternatively, use the result from the literature.
For example, from Hogg 1999 (Distance measures in cosmology), the comoving distance is:
$$
D_{\text{C}}(z) = \frac{c}{H_{0}} \int_{0}^{z} \frac{d z^{\prime}}{\sqrt{\Omega_{m}(1+z^{\prime})^{3}+\Omega_{\Lambda}}}
$$
For z=5.5, Ωm=0.3, ΩΛ=0.7.
This integral can be evaluated using the substitution x = (1 + z'), and the integral becomes:
$$
\frac{1}{\sqrt{\Omega_\Lambda}} \int_{1}^{1+z} \frac{dx}{x \sqrt{\Omega_m x^3 + \Omega_\Lambda}}
$$
With the substitution u = \sqrt{\Omega_m x^3 + \Omega_\Lambda}, leading to:
$$
\frac{1}{3 \sqrt{\Omega_\Lambda \Omega_m}} \left[ \cosh^{-1} \left( \sqrt{\frac{\Omega_\Lambda + \Omega_m (1+z)^3}{\Omega_\Lambda}} \right) \right]
$$
Wait, but perhaps this is getting too involved.
Alternatively, use the approximation for the integral:
For a flat universe, the integral can be approximated by different methods.
For example, if Ωm (1+z)^3 >> ΩΛ, then at high z:
The integral ∫0^z [1 / sqrt(Ωm (1+z')^3)] dz' ≈ [1 / sqrt(Ωm)] ∫0^z (1+z')^{-3/2} dz' = [1 / sqrt(Ωm)] * [2/(1+z)^{1/2} - 2]
But this is the same as the previous approximation.
However, at high z, when Ωm (1+z)^3 >> ΩΛ, the integral is dominated by the matter term, but if z is not extremely high, dark energy still plays a role.
Alternatively, use the result that for the comoving distance in a flat universe, at high z:
D_comov ≈ (c / H0) * (2 / (3 sqrt(Ωm))) * (1 + z)^{1/2}
But this is an approximation.
Wait, if Ωm (1+z)^3 >> ΩΛ, then H(z) ≈ H0 sqrt(Ωm) (1+z)^{3/2}, so the integral becomes:
D_comov ≈ (c / H0) ∫0^z [1 / (sqrt(Ωm) (1+z')^{3/2})] dz'
= (c / (H0 sqrt(Ωm))) ∫0^z (1+z')^{-3/2} dz'
= (c / (H0 sqrt(Ωm))) [2(1+z)^{-1/2} - 2]
But this is the exact integral.
However, this is only valid if the dark energy term can be neglected.
But in reality, even at z=5.5, with Ωm=0.3, ΩΛ=0.7:
Ωm (1+z)^3 = 0.3*(6.5)^3 ≈ 0.3*274.625 ≈ 82.3875
ΩΛ = 0.7
So Ωm (1+z)^3 >> ΩΛ, so yes, at z=5.5, the H(z) is dominated by the matter term.
Thus, the approximation H(z) ≈ H0 sqrt(Ωm) (1+z)^{3/2} is reasonable.
Therefore, the integral becomes:
D_comov ≈ (c / H0) * (sqrt(3)/sqrt(0.3)) * [1 - (1+z)^{-1/2}]
Wait, let's recalculate:
Integral expression:
D_comov = (c / H0) * [1 / sqrt(Ωm)] * [2/(1 + z)^{1/2} - 2]
Wait, no, let me rederive.
Let’s set H0 = 1 for simplicity (units where H0 = 1), then c is in units of H0^{-1}.
But perhaps better to use actual numbers.
Wait, the integral result from before:
∫0^z (1 + z')^{-3/2} dz' = [ -2(1 + z')^{-1/2} ] from 0 to z
= -2(1 + z)^{-1/2} + 2(1 + 0)^{-1/2} = -2/(sqrt(1+z)) + 2
Thus,
D_comov ≈ (c / H0) * (1 / sqrt(Ωm)) * [2/(sqrt(1 + z)) - 2]
But wait, the units here: c / H0 is in Mpc (since H0 is in km/s/Mpc, and c is km/s, so c / H0 is Mpc).
But let's check:
If c = 3 x 10^5 km/s, H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc.
Then c / H0 = (3 x 10^5) / 70 Mpc ≈ 4285.71 Mpc.
Then, D_comov ≈ 4285.71 Mpc / sqrt(0.3) * [2 / sqrt(6.5) - 2]
Wait, sqrt(0.3) ≈ 0.5477, so 1 / 0.5477 ≈ 1.826.
Compute sqrt(6.5) ≈ 2.5495.
Then, 2 / 2.5495 ≈ 0.7847.
Thus,
D_comov ≈ 4285.71 * 1.826 * (0.7847 - 2) ≈ 4285.71 * 1.826 * (-1.2153) ≈ negative number?
This can’t be right.
This suggests a mistake in the formula.
Wait, the integral expression was:
Integral [0 to z] (1 + z')^{-3/2} dz' = 2/(sqrt(1+z)) - 2
But the result should be positive.
Wait, at z=5.5, Integral result is 2/(sqrt(6.5)) - 2 ≈ 0.785 - 2 ≈ -1.215.
But comoving distance can't be negative.
Therefore, this approximation is invalid.
Wait, where is the error?
Ah, the integral from 0 to z of (1+z')^{-3/2} dz' is equal to [-2 (1+z')^{-1/2} ] from 0 to z, which is -2/(sqrt(1+z)) + 2/(sqrt(1+0)), which is -2/(sqrt(1+z)) + 2.
So when we multiply by [1 / sqrt(Ωm)], the term is:
[2 - 2/(sqrt(1+z))] / sqrt(Ωm)
But if we express comoving distance as:
D_comov ≈ (c / H0) * (1 / sqrt(Ωm)) * [2 - 2/(sqrt(1+z))]
= 2 (c / H0) * (1 / sqrt(Ωm)) * [1 - 1/(sqrt(1+z))]
So this is always positive.
So for z=5.5,
D_comov ≈ 2 * 4285.71 Mpc / sqrt(0.3) * (1 - 1/sqrt(6.5))
Compute sqrt(6.5) ≈ 2.5495.
1/sqrt(6.5) ≈ 0.3925
Thus, 1 - 0.3925 ≈ 0.6075
So,
D_comov ≈ 2 * 4285.71 * 0.6075 / 0.5477 ≈ 2 * 4285.71 * (0.6075 / 0.5477) ≈ 2 * 4285.71 * 1.109 ≈ 2 * 4285.71 * 1.109 ≈ 2 * 4748.9 ≈ 9497.8 Mpc ≈ 9.5 Gpc.
But this is not possible, since previous thoughts suggested around 2.2 Gpc, but this approximation gives 9.5 Gpc.
This discrepancy arises because the approximation neglects the dark energy term, which is invalid even at z=5.5, since while Ωm(1+z)^3 is large, the dark energy term can still influence the integral.
Therefore, this approximation overestimates the comoving distance.
Thus, we need a better approach.
Alternatively, use the exact integral.
Let’s denote:
I = ∫0^z [1 / sqrt(Ωm (1 + z')^3 + ΩΛ)] dz'
Let’s make substitution x = 1 + z', then dx = dz', and the integral becomes:
I = ∫1^{1+z} [1 / sqrt(Ωm x^3 + ΩΛ)] dx
This integral can be expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions or approximated numerically.
Alternatively, use a substitution y = x^{-1/2}, so x = y^{-2}, dx = -2 y^{-3} dy
Then,
I = ∫_{y1}^{y0} [1 / sqrt(Ωm y^{-6} + ΩΛ)] * (-2 y^{-3}) dy
Where y0 = (1)^{-1/2} = 1, y1 = (1+z)^{-1/2}
Thus,
I = 2 ∫_{y1}^{y0} [ (Ωm y^{-6} + ΩΛ )^{-1/2} * y^{-3} ] dy
= 2 ∫_{y1}^{y0} [ (Ωm + ΩΛ y^6 )^{-1/2} * y^{3} ] dy
= 2 ∫_{y1}^{y0} [ y^3 / sqrt(Ωm + ΩΛ y^6) ] dy
Let me set u = y^3, then du = 3 y^2 dy, so y^3 dy = (1/3) u du / y^2 ?
This seems complicated.
Alternatively, factor out Ωm:
= 2 ∫_{y1}^{y0}

okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. so, the question is about a quasar observed in the near infrared and optical spectrum with a peak at 790 nm, and then a significant drop in flux at shorter wavelengths. we need to estimate the comoving distance of this quasar from earth given the lambda-cdm model parameters: hubble constant h0 = 70 km/s/mpc, matter density parameter ω_m = 0.3, dark energy density parameter ω_λ = 0.7, and the universe is flat.
the options are 9 gpc, 8 gpc, 7 gpc, or 6 gpc.
first, i need to recall what comoving distance is.
comoving distance is the distance between two objects in the universe, measured along the path that would be taken if the universe were not expanding.
it essentially factors out the expansion of the universe and gives a kind of "static" distance.
for a flat universe, the comoving distance can be calculated using the integral of the scale factor over the history of the universe, divided by the speed of light.
but wait, the problem mentions the current scale factor a=1.
so, the comoving distance at a=1 is the same as the comoving distance we calculate today, right?
so, we need to compute the comoving distance to the quasar based on the given cosmological parameters and the observation of the peak wavelength.
but how do we connect the peak wavelength to the distance?
the key here might be the lyman-alpha forest and the lyman-alpha forest's characteristic wavelength.
wait, quasars often show absorption lines due to intervening gas clouds, and the lyman-alpha transition (for hydrogen) occurs at a rest wavelength of about 1216 nm.
however, the problem mentions a peak at 790 nm.
wait, 790 nm is in the near-infrared (about 0.79 μm).
if there's a peak at 790 nm and a drop at shorter wavelengths (i.e., bluer than 790 nm), that might correspond to a cutoff or a feature in the quasar's spectrum.
one possibility is the lyman-alpha forest.
the lyman-alpha forest is a series of absorption lines seen in the spectra of distant quasars, caused by neutral hydrogen gas in the intergalactic medium.
these lines are blueshifted relative to the quasar's rest frame, and the density of these lines increases as you go to longer wavelengths (i.e., redder) in the observed spectrum.
however, i need to recall if there's a characteristic wavelength related to the lyman-alpha forest that would cause a peak in the flux at a certain observed wavelength.
alternatively, maybe this peak is related to the so-called "proximity effect" where near the quasar, the intergalactic medium is ionized, reducing absorption.
however, the problem states that at wavelengths shorter than 790 nm, the flux drops significantly.
that suggests a cutoff or a break in the spectrum at 790 nm.
wait, another thought: the lyman-alpha forest can cause a gunn-peterson trough.
the gunn-peterson effect predicts that in a neutral intergalactic medium, the observed flux shortward of the lyman-alpha emission line (which would be at a wavelength corresponding to the quasar's redshift) would be suppressed due to absorption by neutral hydrogen.
if the quasar's spectrum shows a drop in flux below 790 nm, this might indicate that the lyman-alpha forest is becoming very opaque at wavelengths shorter than 790 nm.
the rest frame wavelength of the lyman-alpha transition is 1216 nm.
but the observed wavelength is related to the rest frame wavelength by (observed wavelength) = (1 + z) * (rest wavelength).
if the observed wavelength is 790 nm, and the rest wavelength for lyman-alpha is 1216 nm, then (1 + z) = (observed wavelength) / (rest wavelength) = 790 nm / 1216 nm ≈ 0.65.
wait, but that would give z ≈ -0.35, which is impossible because redshift can't be negative.
wait, maybe i have that backward.
wait, let me think again.
the rest frame wavelength of the gunn-peterson trough would be the lyman-alpha wavelength (1216 å), but if the observed wavelength is 790 nm, then the relationship between observed wavelength (λ_obs), emitted wavelength (λ_emit), and redshift z is λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + z).
so, solving for z, we have z = (λ_obs / λ_emit) - 1.
but wait, if λ_emit is 1216 å (which is 121.6 nm), and λ_obs is 790 nm, then z = (790 nm / 121.6 nm) - 1 ≈ (6.5) - 1 = 5.5.
wait, that would give a redshift z ≈ 5.5.
but if that's the case, then the quasar is at z ≈ 5.5, and we need to compute the comoving distance to this redshift in a lambda-cdm universe with h0 = 70 km/s/mpc, ω_m = 0.3, ω_λ = 0.7 (and flat, so ω_k = 0).
so the next step is to calculate the comoving distance for a source at redshift z = 5.5 in such a universe.
but wait, hold on.
let me make sure that this connection is correct.
if the gunn-peterson trough is observed at λ_obs = 790 nm for the lyman-alpha transition (which is at 1216 å in the rest frame), then yes, z ≈ 5.5.
but why is there a peak at 790 nm?
the flux drops at shorter wavelengths (i.e., higher energy), which would correspond to the trough.
wait, perhaps the peak is at 790 nm because that's where the flux starts dropping due to the gunn-peterson trough.
so the peak would be just redward of the trough.
alternatively, maybe the peak is the lyman-alpha emission line of the quasar itself.
wait, quasars do emit a bright lyman-alpha line, but if the observed peak is at 790 nm, then the emission line would be redshifted.
let's check.
if the rest wavelength is 1216 å (0.1216 nm), and the observed wavelength is 790 nm, then z = (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1 = (790 nm / 0.1216 nm) - 1.
that would be enormous, like z = 6000.
that's not possible.
wait, that suggests a miscalculation.
wait, 1216 å is 121.6 nm.
ah, 1216 å = 0.1216 nm?
no, wait: 1 nm = 10 å.
so 1216 å is 121.6 nm.
so correct.
so if the rest wavelength is 121.6 nm, and the observed wavelength is 790 nm, then z = (790 / 121.6) -1 ≈ 6.5 -1 = 5.5.
so redshift z ≈ 5.5.
alternatively, if the quasar's lyman-alpha emission line is observed at 790 nm, then z ≈ 5.5.
but the question is about the comoving distance of the quasar.
to compute the comoving distance, we need to integrate the scale factor over the time since the light was emitted until now.
the formula for comoving distance is:
$$
d_{\text{comov}} = c \int_0^z \frac{dz'}{h(z')}
$$
where h(z) is the hubble parameter as a function of redshift.
in a flat lambda-cdm universe, the hubble parameter is given by:
$$
h(z) = h_0 \sqrt{\omega_{m}(1+z)^3 + \omega_{\lambda}}
$$
given the parameters: h0 = 70 km/s/mpc, ωm = 0.3, ωλ = 0.7.
so we need to compute the integral:
$$
d_{\text{comov}} = \frac{c}{h_0} \int_0^5.5 \frac{dz}{\sqrt{\omega_{m}(1+z)^3 + \omega_{\lambda}}}
$$
note that c is in units of km/s, so the comoving distance will come out in mpc.
but since the answer choices are in gpc, we need to convert units appropriately.
first, let me compute the integral numerically.
however, since i can't perform numerical integrations here, i can recall approximate comoving distance-redshift relations.
alternatively, use the approximation for high redshift.
for z >> 1, the comoving distance can be approximated as:
$$
d_{\text{comov}} \approx \frac{c}{h_0 \sqrt{\omega_m}} \left[ \sqrt{\frac{\omega_m}{\omega_\lambda}} \tanh^{-1} \left( \sqrt{ \frac{\omega_\lambda}{\omega_m (1+z)^3 + \omega_\lambda} } \right) \right]
$$
but this might be complicated.
alternatively, refer to standard values.
let's think in parallel.

<path>
1: for a flat universe, the comoving distance can be approximated using the formula d_comov ≈ (c/h0) * (2/3) * z for z << 1. this approximation is not suitable for high redshifts. for z=5.5, a different approximation is needed. the formula d_comov ≈ (c/h0) * (2/3) * z is not applicable for z=5.5. a more accurate approach is required for high redshifts. at high redshifts, dark energy becomes less dominant. at z=5.5, the term (1+z)^3 in the hubble parameter h(z) = h0 * sqrt(ωm*(1+z)^3 + ωλ) becomes (1+5.5)^3 = 6.5^3 ≈ 274.625. with ωm = 0.3 and ωλ = 0.7, the hubble parameter at z=5.5 is h(z) ≈ h0 * sqrt(0.3 * 274.625 + 0.7) ≈ h0 * sqrt(82.3875 + 0.7) ≈ h0 * sqrt(83.0875) ≈ h0 * 9.115. the integrand dz/h(z) becomes approximately 1/(9.115 * h0).
the integral of dz from 0 to z over h(z) is approximated by integrating from 0 to z over [h0 * 9.115]. the integral ∫0^z [1/(9.115 h0)] dz' is approximately z/(9.115 h0).
the product of the speed of light c and this integral yields d_comov ≈ c * [z / (9.115 h0)].
with h0 = 70 km/s/mpc, this approximation is used.
the speed of light c is approximately 3 x 10^5 km/s.
the term c/h0 is approximately (3 x 10^5 km/s) / (70 km/s/mpc) ≈ 4285.7 mpc.
the comoving distance d_comov is approximated by d_comov ≈ (4285.7 mpc) * (5.5 / 9.115) ).
the factor (5.5 / 9.115) is approximately 0.603.
the product 4285.7 mpc * 0.603 is approximately 2583 mpc.
the result of 2583 mpc is converted to gpc.
2583 mpc is approximately 2.583 gpc.
this approximation is considered rough.
a more accurate method is needed.

the approximate comoving distance for z=5.5 was calculated as about 2.583 gpc. the approximate comoving distance for z=6 was calculated as about 3 gpc.

the integral ∫0^z [1/(9.111 * h0)] dz' is approximately z/(9.111 * h0).
the product of the speed of light c and this integral yields d_comov ≈ c * [z / (9.111 * h0)].
with h0 = 70 km/s/mpc, this approximation is used.
the speed of light c is approximately 3 x 10^5 km/s.
the term c/h0 is approximately (3 x 10^5 km/s) / (70 km/s/mpc) ≈ 4285.7 mpc.
the comoving distance d_comov is approximated by d_comov ≈ (4285.7 mpc) * (5.5 / 9.111).
the factor (5.5 / 9.111) is approximately 0.603.
the product 4285.7 mpc * 0.603 is approximately 2583 mpc.

2583 mpc is approximately 2.583 gpc.

<conclusion>
the approximate comoving distance for z=5.5 was calculated as about 2.583 gpc. the approximate comoving distance for z=6 was calculated as about 3 gpc.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
but according to the standard comoving distance for z=6 is about 3000 mpc or 3 gpc.
wait, but this is contradictory.
alternatively, perhaps use a more precise method.
let me recall that the comoving distance for a flat universe is given by:
$$
d_{\text{comov}} = \frac{c}{h_0} \int_0^z \frac{dz'}{\sqrt{\omega_m (1+z')^3 + \omega_\lambda}}
$$
for h0 = 70 km/s/mpc, ωm = 0.3, ωλ = 0.7.
let me convert h0 to units of (km/s)/mpc to 1/gyr.
the speed of light c is approximately 3 x 10^5 km/s.
so, c / h0 ≈ (3 x 10^5 km/s) / (70 km/s/mpc) ≈ 4285.7 mpc.
then, the integral part is the dimensionless part.
let me consider z = 5.5.
the integral ∫0^5.5 [1 / sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 + 0.7)] dz'.
this integral is not straightforward, but perhaps we can approximate it.
at high z, the term 0.3*(1+z')^3 dominates over 0.7, so the integral becomes approximately ∫0^5.5 [1 / sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3)] dz'.
let’s compute that:
sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3) = (1+z')^(3/2) * sqrt(0.3)
so the integrand becomes 1 / [(1+z')^(3/2) * sqrt(0.3)]
thus, the integral simplifies to 1 / sqrt(0.3) ∫0^5.5 (1+z')^(-3/2) dz'
integrate (1+z')^(-3/2) from 0 to 5.5:
the integral of (1+z')^(-3/2) dz' is -2*(1+z')^(-1/2)
evaluated from 0 to 5.5:
-2[(1+5.5)^(-1/2) - (1+0)^(-1/2)] = -2[(7.5^(-1/2)) - (1)^(-1/2)] = -2[(1/√7.5) - 1]
calculate:
√7.5 ≈ 2.7386
so 1/√7.5 ≈ 0.3651
thus, -2[0.3651 - 1] = -2[-0.6349] ≈ 1.2698
multiply by 1/sqrt(0.3):
sqrt(0.3) ≈ 0.5477
so 1 / 0.5477 ≈ 1.826
thus, the integral ≈ 1.826 * 1.2698 ≈ 2.319
thus, the comoving distance d_comov ≈ 4285.7 mpc * 2.319 ≈ 4285.7 * 2.319 ≈ 10,000 mpc ≈ 10 gpc.
but this is way off since previous estimates for z=6 were 3 gpc.
clearly, this approximation is not valid.
wait, but where is the mistake here?
wait, if i use the approximation that at high z, the integral is dominated by the matter term, but we need to check when the dark energy starts to become significant.
alternatively, maybe a better approach is to note that for a given set of cosmological parameters, comoving distance scales with certain relations.
alternatively, perhaps use the relation between angular diameter distance, which is d_a = d_comov / (1+z).
but the question is about comoving distance.
alternatively, perhaps use the luminosity distance, which for expansion is d_l = (1+z) d_comov.
wait, but how does this help?
wait, but since the problem refers to flux observations, maybe there's a connection through the flux-distance relation, but the problem does not provide flux values, just a description of the spectrum.
so probably not necessary.
wait, going back.
the problem states that in the observed spectrum, there's a peak at 790 nm, and a drop at shorter wavelengths.
if this peak is due to the lyman-alpha forest becoming opaque, then the observed wavelength of 790 nm would correspond to the lyman-alpha rest frame wavelength (1216 å) multiplied by (1+z).
so:
λ_obs = 790 nm = 1216 å * (1+z)
wait, but 1216 å = 0.1216 nm, so 0.1216*(1+z) = 0.790 => (1+z) = 0.790 / 0.1216 ≈ 6.5, so z ≈ 5.5.
therefore, the quasar is at redshift z ≈ 5.5.
then, the comoving distance for z=5.5 in a lambda-cdm model with h0=70, ωm=0.3, ωλ=0.7.
let me recall that for these parameters, the age of the universe at z=5.5 is roughly ... but perhaps instead look up or approximate the comoving distance.
alternatively, use the approximation that the comoving distance for z >1 can be approximated by:
d_comov ≈ \frac{c}{h_0} \times \text{scale factor based on cosmological parameters}
for example, from cosmology resources, the comoving distance at z=5.5 for h0=70, ωm=0.3, ωλ=0.7 is approximately 2200 mpc.
wait, but 2200 mpc is 2.2 gpc.
the options are 6,7,8,9 gpc.
that can't be.
wait, but this contradicts earlier thoughts.
wait, perhaps the problem is not about the lyman-alpha emission line but about the lyman-alpha forest's effect on the quasar's spectrum.
if the quasar's continuum drops below 790 nm, that might indicate that this wavelength corresponds to the lyman-alpha forest's opacity.
the actual rest-frame wavelength of the drop would be 1216 å, so observed at 790 nm, implying z = (790 nm / 0.1216 nm) -1 = (790 / 12160) -1.
wait, no.
wait, 1216 å is 121.6 nm.
so if the rest frame wavelength is 121.6 nm, and the observed wavelength is 790 nm, then z = (790 / 121.6) -1 ≈ 6.5 -1 = 5.5.
so yes, z=5.5.
so the quasar is at z=5.5.
then, the comoving distance is calculated.
but previous approximated thought gives 2.2 gpc, but options are higher.
wait, maybe the confusion is between different distance measures?
wait, sometimes people confuse comoving distance with angular diameter distance or luminosity distance.
but the question specifies comoving distance.
wait, angular diameter distance is d_a = d_comov / (1+z), and luminosity distance is d_l = (1+z) d_comov.
but how is the comoving distance calculated?
wait, perhaps another mistake: when converting h0 to proper units.
let me redo the calculation step by step.
given h0 = 70 km/s/mpc.
the speed of light c = 3 x 10^5 km/s.
thus, the hubble time is c / h0.
compute that:
c / h0 = (3 x 10^5 km/s) / (70 km/s/mpc) = (3 x 10^5)/70 mpc ≈ 4285.71 mpc.
so c / h0 ≈ 4.2857 gpc (since 1 gpc = 10^3 mpc).
now, the comoving distance integral is:
d_comov = (c / h0) * ∫0^z [1 / sqrt(ωm (1 + z')^3 + ωλ)] dz'
with z =5.5, ωm=0.3, ωλ=0.7.
but integrating this function requires either numerical methods or looking up values.
alternatively, use approximations.
for a flat universe, there is an analytic expression for the integral.
the integral for the comoving distance in a flat universe (ω_total=1) is:
d_comov = (c / h0) * [√(ωλ) / 3 h0] * f(z; ωm, ωλ)
where f is some function.
wait, actually, according to the formulae, in a flat universe, the integral can be expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions or approximated.
alternatively, use the result from the literature.
for example, from hogg 1999 (distance measures in cosmology), the comoving distance is:
$$
d_{\text{c}}(z) = \frac{c}{h_{0}} \int_{0}^{z} \frac{d z^{\prime}}{\sqrt{\omega_{m}(1+z^{\prime})^{3}+\omega_{\lambda}}}
$$
for z=5.5, ωm=0.3, ωλ=0.7.
this integral can be evaluated using the substitution x = (1 + z'), and the integral becomes:
$$
\frac{1}{\sqrt{\omega_\lambda}} \int_{1}^{1+z} \frac{dx}{x \sqrt{\omega_m x^3 + \omega_\lambda}}
$$
with the substitution u = \sqrt{\omega_m x^3 + \omega_\lambda}, leading to:
$$
\frac{1}{3 \sqrt{\omega_\lambda \omega_m}} \left[ \cosh^{-1} \left( \sqrt{\frac{\omega_\lambda + \omega_m (1+z)^3}{\omega_\lambda}} \right) \right]
$$
wait, but perhaps this is getting too involved.
alternatively, use the approximation for the integral:
for a flat universe, the integral can be approximated by different methods.
for example, if ωm (1+z)^3 >> ωλ, then at high z:
the integral ∫0^z [1 / sqrt(ωm (1+z')^3)] dz' ≈ [1 / sqrt(ωm)] ∫0^z (1+z')^{-3/2} dz' = [1 / sqrt(ωm)] * [2/(1+z)^{1/2} - 2]
but this is the same as the previous approximation.
however, at high z, when ωm (1+z)^3 >> ωλ, the integral is dominated by the matter term, but if z is not extremely high, dark energy still plays a role.
alternatively, use the result that for the comoving distance in a flat universe, at high z:
d_comov ≈ (c / h0) * (2 / (3 sqrt(ωm))) * (1 + z)^{1/2}
but this is an approximation.
wait, if ωm (1+z)^3 >> ωλ, then h(z) ≈ h0 sqrt(ωm) (1+z)^{3/2}, so the integral becomes:
d_comov ≈ (c / h0) ∫0^z [1 / (sqrt(ωm) (1+z')^{3/2})] dz'
= (c / (h0 sqrt(ωm))) ∫0^z (1+z')^{-3/2} dz'
= (c / (h0 sqrt(ωm))) [2(1+z)^{-1/2} - 2]
but this is the exact integral.
however, this is only valid if the dark energy term can be neglected.
but in reality, even at z=5.5, with ωm=0.3, ωλ=0.7:
ωm (1+z)^3 = 0.3*(6.5)^3 ≈ 0.3*274.625 ≈ 82.3875
ωλ = 0.7
so ωm (1+z)^3 >> ωλ, so yes, at z=5.5, the h(z) is dominated by the matter term.
thus, the approximation h(z) ≈ h0 sqrt(ωm) (1+z)^{3/2} is reasonable.
therefore, the integral becomes:
d_comov ≈ (c / h0) * (sqrt(3)/sqrt(0.3)) * [1 - (1+z)^{-1/2}]
wait, let's recalculate:
integral expression:
d_comov = (c / h0) * [1 / sqrt(ωm)] * [2/(1 + z)^{1/2} - 2]
wait, no, let me rederive.
let’s set h0 = 1 for simplicity (units where h0 = 1), then c is in units of h0^{-1}.
but perhaps better to use actual numbers.
wait, the integral result from before:
∫0^z (1 + z')^{-3/2} dz' = [ -2(1 + z')^{-1/2} ] from 0 to z
= -2(1 + z)^{-1/2} + 2(1 + 0)^{-1/2} = -2/(sqrt(1+z)) + 2
thus,
d_comov ≈ (c / h0) * (1 / sqrt(ωm)) * [2/(sqrt(1 + z)) - 2]
but wait, the units here: c / h0 is in mpc (since h0 is in km/s/mpc, and c is km/s, so c / h0 is mpc).
but let's check:
if c = 3 x 10^5 km/s, h0 = 70 km/s/mpc.
then c / h0 = (3 x 10^5) / 70 mpc ≈ 4285.71 mpc.
then, d_comov ≈ 4285.71 mpc / sqrt(0.3) * [2 / sqrt(6.5) - 2]
wait, sqrt(0.3) ≈ 0.5477, so 1 / 0.5477 ≈ 1.826.
compute sqrt(6.5) ≈ 2.5495.
then, 2 / 2.5495 ≈ 0.7847.
thus,
d_comov ≈ 4285.71 * 1.826 * (0.7847 - 2) ≈ 4285.71 * 1.826 * (-1.2153) ≈ negative number?
this can’t be right.
this suggests a mistake in the formula.
wait, the integral expression was:
integral [0 to z] (1 + z')^{-3/2} dz' = 2/(sqrt(1+z)) - 2
but the result should be positive.
wait, at z=5.5, integral result is 2/(sqrt(6.5)) - 2 ≈ 0.785 - 2 ≈ -1.215.
but comoving distance can't be negative.
therefore, this approximation is invalid.
wait, where is the error?
ah, the integral from 0 to z of (1+z')^{-3/2} dz' is equal to [-2 (1+z')^{-1/2} ] from 0 to z, which is -2/(sqrt(1+z)) + 2/(sqrt(1+0)), which is -2/(sqrt(1+z)) + 2.
so when we multiply by [1 / sqrt(ωm)], the term is:
[2 - 2/(sqrt(1+z))] / sqrt(ωm)
but if we express comoving distance as:
d_comov ≈ (c / h0) * (1 / sqrt(ωm)) * [2 - 2/(sqrt(1+z))]
= 2 (c / h0) * (1 / sqrt(ωm)) * [1 - 1/(sqrt(1+z))]
so this is always positive.
so for z=5.5,
d_comov ≈ 2 * 4285.71 mpc / sqrt(0.3) * (1 - 1/sqrt(6.5))
compute sqrt(6.5) ≈ 2.5495.
1/sqrt(6.5) ≈ 0.3925
thus, 1 - 0.3925 ≈ 0.6075
so,
d_comov ≈ 2 * 4285.71 * 0.6075 / 0.5477 ≈ 2 * 4285.71 * (0.6075 / 0.5477) ≈ 2 * 4285.71 * 1.109 ≈ 2 * 4285.71 * 1.109 ≈ 2 * 4748.9 ≈ 9497.8 mpc ≈ 9.5 gpc.
but this is not possible, since previous thoughts suggested around 2.2 gpc, but this approximation gives 9.5 gpc.
this discrepancy arises because the approximation neglects the dark energy term, which is invalid even at z=5.5, since while ωm(1+z)^3 is large, the dark energy term can still influence the integral.
therefore, this approximation overestimates the comoving distance.
thus, we need a better approach.
alternatively, use the exact integral.
let’s denote:
i = ∫0^z [1 / sqrt(ωm (1 + z')^3 + ωλ)] dz'
let’s make substitution x = 1 + z', then dx = dz', and the integral becomes:
i = ∫1^{1+z} [1 / sqrt(ωm x^3 + ωλ)] dx
this integral can be expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions or approximated numerically.
alternatively, use a substitution y = x^{-1/2}, so x = y^{-2}, dx = -2 y^{-3} dy
then,
i = ∫_{y1}^{y0} [1 / sqrt(ωm y^{-6} + ωλ)] * (-2 y^{-3}) dy
where y0 = (1)^{-1/2} = 1, y1 = (1+z)^{-1/2}
thus,
i = 2 ∫_{y1}^{y0} [ (ωm y^{-6} + ωλ )^{-1/2} * y^{-3} ] dy
= 2 ∫_{y1}^{y0} [ (ωm + ωλ y^6 )^{-1/2} * y^{3} ] dy
= 2 ∫_{y1}^{y0} [ y^3 / sqrt(ωm + ωλ y^6) ] dy
let me set u = y^3, then du = 3 y^2 dy, so y^3 dy = (1/3) u du / y^2 ?
this seems complicated.
alternatively, factor out ωm:
= 2 ∫_{y1}^{y0}
