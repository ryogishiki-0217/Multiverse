Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the kinematically allowed decays of the boson X, which has a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction is given by the Lagrangian term: \mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda{f}\bar{\psi}{f}(y)(\upsilon + X(y))\psi_{f}(y). Hmm, so this looks like a Yukawa interaction term. The boson X is coupling to fermions through a term proportional to the vacuum expectation value (vev) υ plus the field X. So, at tree level, the decay of X would involve it splitting into a pair of fermions, right?

But wait, actually, for pair production, the rest mass energy of the pair must be less than or equal to the energy of the incoming particle. In this case, since the X boson is at rest when it decays, the total energy available is its rest energy, which is 6 GeV. So, for each decay channel f\bar{f}, the rest mass energy of the fermion and anti-fermion must sum to less than or equal to 6 GeV. But since the fermions have equal mass, that means 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV → m_f ≤ 3 GeV. So each fermion's mass must be ≤ 3 GeV. But I need to check the masses of the quarks and leptons to see which ones are light enough.
Wait, but quark masses are a bit tricky because they depend on the energy scale, but since this is a problem likely using their masses at the electroweak scale, which are: Let's think about quark masses first. Up-type quarks: - u quark: ~2-5 MeV - c quark: ~1.2-1.5 GeV - t quark: ~173 GeV Down-type quarks: - d quark: ~4-8 MeV - s quark: ~80-130 MeV - b quark: ~4.18 GeV Leptons: - e: 0.511 MeV - μ: 105.7 MeV - τ: 1.777 GeV So, for each fermion, we need to check if 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV. Let's go through each option.
Let's think in parallel.

1: The decay X → c\bar{c} is considered, with the charm quark mass m_c ranging from 1.2-1.5 GeV. The product 2m_c falls within the range 2.4-3 GeV. This value is less than or equal to the boson X's mass of 6 GeV, indicating that this decay is kinematically allowed.
</Path>
<Path>
2: For the decay X → b\bar{b}, the quark mass is approximately 4.18 GeV, so the sum of the masses is 2 * 4.18 GeV ≈ 8.36 GeV, which is greater than the boson mass of 6 GeV. This decay is kinematically forbidden.

<Path>
3: The decay X → s\bar{s} is kinematically allowed, as the top quark mass is greater than 3 GeV and the s quark mass is less than 3 GeV.

4: The u quark has a mass of approximately 2-5 MeV, which means the combined mass of a u and anti-u quark is approximately 4-10 MeV, a value significantly less than the 6 GeV mass of the X boson. The decay X → u\bar{u} is therefore kinematically allowed.

<Conclusion>
The decays X → c\bar{c}, X → s\bar{s}, X → u\bar{u}, X → d\bar{d}, X → τ+τ-, X → μ+μ-, and X → e+e- are kinematically allowed. The decays X → b\bar{b} and X → t\bar{t} are kinematically forbidden because the combined masses of their respective fermion pairs (b quarks at approximately 8.36 GeV and top quarks at approximately 346 GeV) exceed the 6 GeV mass of the boson X.

So, putting this all together, the allowed decays are: - c\bar{c} (1.2-1.5 GeV, sum 2.4-3 GeV) - s\bar{s} (0.08-0.13 GeV, sum 0.16-0.26 GeV) - u\bar{u} (0.004-0.010 GeV, sum ~0.008-0.02 GeV) - d\bar{d} (0.004-0.008 GeV, sum ~0.008-0.016 GeV) - τ^{+}τ^{-} (1.777 GeV, sum 3.554 GeV) - μ^{+}μ^{-} (0.1057 GeV, sum 0.2114 GeV) - e^{+}e^{-} (0.000511 GeV, sum ~0.001 GeV) Wait, but t quark is way too heavy, so t\bar{t} is not allowed. So now looking at the options: A) X→c\bar{c},s\bar{s},u\bar{u},d\bar{d},τ^{+}τ^{-},μ^{+}μ^{-},e^{+}e^{-} B) X→b\bar{b},s\bar{s},u\bar{u},d\bar{d},τ^{+}τ^{-},e^{+}e^{-} C) X→c\bar{c},s\bar{s},u\bar{u},d\bar{d},t\bar{t},τ^{+}τ^{-},μ^{+}μ^{-},e^{+}e^{-} D) X→b\bar{b},s\bar{s},u\bar{u},d\bar{d},τ^{+}τ^{-},μ^{+}μ^{-},e^{+}e^{-} So, the correct answer should include all the fermions whose pair mass is less than 6 GeV. But let me check again: c\bar{c} is allowed, as 2*1.5=3 GeV <6 GeV. s\bar{s}: 2*0.1=0.2 GeV <6 GeV. u\bar{u}: same as s. d\bar{d}: same as s. τ\tau: 2*1.777=3.554 GeV <6 GeV. μ\mu: 2*0.1057=0.211 GeV <6 GeV. e\+e-: 2*0.0005=0.001 GeV <6 GeV. So all of these are allowed. But the options are A, B, C, D. Let's see: Option A lists c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, τ+τ−, μ+μ−, e+e−. That's all allowed. So that seems correct. Option B includes b\bar{b}, which is 2*4.18=8.36 GeV >6 GeV, so forbidden. So B is wrong. Option C includes t\bar{t}, which is 2*173=346 GeV, way more than 6 GeV. Forbidden. So C is wrong. Option D includes b\bar{b} again, which is forbidden, so D is wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is A. But wait, let me check if there are any other considerations. For example, the interaction term: \mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda{f}\bar{\psi}{f}(y)(\upsilon + X(y))\psi_{f}(y). This is similar to the Yukawa interaction. The term \upsilon is the vev, which gives mass to the fermions when X is the Higgs boson. But here, the interaction is with the X field itself. So, the coupling here would lead to the decay X → ff̄ via the vertex λf \bar{ψ}f X ψf. So, all fermions that couple to X are those present in the Lagrangian. Assuming that all fermions (quarks and leptons) are included in the Lagrangian term, then all these fermions are allowed. But the problem doesn't specify which fermions are involved, just "fermions" in general. But given the answer choices include quarks (c, s, u, d, b, t) and leptons (τ, μ, e), we need to check which ones are allowed. But since the problem is about kinematics only, not couplings, even if a fermion isn't coupled, kinematically, if their mass is below the limit, they could decay. But in the standard model, fermions get mass from the Higgs via Yukawa coupling, so the coupling λf should be non-zero only for fermions that get mass from the Higgs. So if X is another boson similar to the Higgs, then only fermions that couple to X can decay to them. But the problem says "fermions" in general, but the given answer choices include both quarks and leptons. However, the question is about kinematics, not dynamics. So even if dynamically the coupling is zero, kinematically, if the mass is below the threshold, the decay is allowed. But in the context of exam questions, usually, they consider that only the fermions that are coupled to the boson can decay. So if the interaction is given by that Lagrangian, then all fermions that are present in the term \bar{\psi}_f \psi_f coupled to X will decay. So perhaps the answer is all the ones listed in the options that are possible. But the options include heavy quarks like b and t. But according to the Lagrangian, if the boson X is similar to the Higgs, then all fermions couple to it. But in reality, the Higgs decays to fermions only if they are coupled, which all standard model fermions are. But kinematically, the boson mass is 6 GeV. So if the Higgs (or X) couples to all fermions, but only the ones with mass lower than 6 GeV/2 = 3 GeV can decay. However, the top quark is 173 GeV, so too heavy. But bottom quark is ~4.1 GeV, so B decay is not allowed. So if X couples to all fermions, then the possible decays are the ones where 2m_f <6 GeV. So fermions with mass less than 3 GeV. Then the allowed quarks are u, d, s, c (since c is ~1.5 GeV). Wait, but c is ~1.5 GeV, so 2*1.5=3 GeV. Hmm. So if exact, then c\bar{c} decay would have a threshold at 3 GeV. But the X boson is 6 GeV, so that would be allowed. But if c quark mass is around 1.2-1.5 GeV, so let's say the mass is 1.5 GeV, then the pair mass is 3 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So allowed. But if the quark mass is higher, like 1.5 GeV, then 3 GeV is still less than 6 GeV. So allowed. So all of the quarks u, d, s, c are allowed. Wait, but then t is too heavy, b is 4.1 GeV, so b\bar{b} would be 8.2 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So forbidden. So the allowed quarks are u, d, s, c. Leptons: tau is 1.777 GeV, so pair mass 3.554 GeV <6 GeV. Muon is 0.1057 GeV, pair mass 0.211 GeV. Electron is 0.0005 GeV, pair mass 0.001 GeV. So all leptons are allowed. So the decays allowed are u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, s\bar{s}, c\bar{c}, τ\tau, μ\mu, e\+e−. Looking at the options: Option A lists all of these. Option C includes t\bar{t}, which is forbidden. Option B includes b\bar{b}, which is forbidden. Option D includes b\bar{b}, which is forbidden. So the correct answer should be A. But wait, the options include different combinations. Let me check again: A) c\bar{c},s\bar{s},u\bar{u},d\bar{d},τ+τ−,μ+μ−,e+e− Yes, all these are allowed. B) b\bar{b},s\bar{s},u\bar{u},d\bar{d},τ+τ−,e+e− Here, b\bar{b} is forbidden. But includes τ and e, which are allowed. But since b\bar{b} is forbidden, B is incorrect. C) c\bar{c},s\bar{s},u\bar{u},d\bar{d},t\bar{t},τ+τ−,μ+μ−,e+e− But t\bar{t} is forbidden. So C is incorrect. D) b\bar{b},s\bar{s},u\bar{u},d\bar{d},τ+τ−,μ+μ−,e+e− Here, includes b\bar{b}, which is forbidden. So D is incorrect. Therefore, the correct answer is A. But wait, another thing to check: the problem says "at the lowest order". Since the interaction is a Yukawa coupling, the decay is a tree-level process. So all fermions coupled to X can decay at tree level. If all fermions are coupled (as per the Lagrangian), then the only limitation is kinematic. So if the only issue is kinematics (mass too high), then the answer is A. But in the options, D is similar to A but includes b\bar{b} and τ, μ, e. Wait, but D includes b\bar{b}, which is forbidden. So D is wrong. Option A is correct. Wait, the options might have some differences in the leptons. Let me check: Option A includes τ, μ, e. Option D includes τ, μ, e as well. But D also includes b\bar{b}, which is forbidden. So if the answer includes all the quarks u, d, s, c (which is in A) and the leptons τ, μ, e, then A is correct. The correct answer is A.

Answer: To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson X with a mass of 6 GeV, we need to ensure that the total mass of the decay products (fermion-antifermion pairs) is less than or equal to the boson's mass. 

1. **Quark Masses**:
   - **u, d**: ~0.005 GeV (pair mass ~0.01 GeV)
   - **s**: ~0.1 GeV (pair mass ~0.2 GeV)
   - **c**: ~1.5 GeV (pair mass ~3 GeV)
   - **b**: ~4.18 GeV (pair mass ~8.36 GeV, **forbidden**)
   - **t**: ~173 GeV (pair mass ~346 GeV, **forbidden**)

2. **Lepton Masses**:
   - **e**: ~0.0005 GeV (pair mass ~0.001 GeV)
   - **μ**: ~0.1057 GeV (pair mass ~0.211 GeV)
   - **τ**: ~1.777 GeV (pair mass ~3.554 GeV)

All quark and lepton pairs with a combined mass less than 6 GeV are allowed. The decays involving bottom quarks (b\bar{b}) and top quarks (t\bar{t}) are forbidden due to their high masses. 

Evaluating the options:
- **Option A** includes all allowed decays: \(c\bar{c}\), \(s\bar{s}\), \(u\bar{u}\), \(d\bar{d}\), \(\tau^+\tau^-\), \(\mu^+\mu^-\), and \(e^+e^-\).
- **Option B** and **Option D** include \(b\bar{b}\), which is forbidden.
- **Option C** includes \(t\bar{t}\), which is forbidden.

The correct answer is **Option A**.

9: the t quark has a mass of approximately 173 gev. the sum of its mass with its antiparticle is 2 * 173 gev, which is 346 gev. this exceeds the 6 gev mass of the boson x. the decay x → t\bar{t} is kinematically forbidden.

<conclusion>
the decays x → c\bar{c}, x → s\bar{s}, x → u\bar{u}, x → d\bar{d}, x → τ+τ-, x → μ+μ-, and x → e+e- are kinematically allowed. the decays x → b\bar{b} and x → t\bar{t} are kinematically forbidden because the combined masses of their respective fermion pairs (b quarks at approximately 8.36 gev and top quarks at approximately 346 gev) exceed the 6 gev mass of the boson x.

so, putting this all together, the allowed decays are: - c\bar{c} (1.2-1.5 gev, sum 2.4-3 gev) - s\bar{s} (0.08-0.13 gev, sum 0.16-0.26 gev) - u\bar{u} (0.004-0.010 gev, sum ~0.008-0.02 gev) - d\bar{d} (0.004-0.008 gev, sum ~0.008-0.016 gev) - τ^{+}τ^{-} (1.777 gev, sum 3.554 gev) - μ^{+}μ^{-} (0.1057 gev, sum 0.2114 gev) - e^{+}e^{-} (0.000511 gev, sum ~0.001 gev) wait, but t quark is way too heavy, so t\bar{t} is not allowed. so now looking at the options: a) x→c\bar{c},s\bar{s},u\bar{u},d\bar{d},τ^{+}τ^{-},μ^{+}μ^{-},e^{+}e^{-} b) x→b\bar{b},s\bar{s},u\bar{u},d\bar{d},τ^{+}τ^{-},e^{+}e^{-} c) x→c\bar{c},s\bar{s},u\bar{u},d\bar{d},t\bar{t},τ^{+}τ^{-},μ^{+}μ^{-},e^{+}e^{-} d) x→b\bar{b},s\bar{s},u\bar{u},d\bar{d},τ^{+}τ^{-},μ^{+}μ^{-},e^{+}e^{-} so, the correct answer should include all the fermions whose pair mass is less than 6 gev. but let me check again: c\bar{c} is allowed, as 2*1.5=3 gev <6 gev. s\bar{s}: 2*0.1=0.2 gev <6 gev. u\bar{u}: same as s. d\bar{d}: same as s. τ\tau: 2*1.777=3.554 gev <6 gev. μ\mu: 2*0.1057=0.211 gev <6 gev. e\+e-: 2*0.0005=0.001 gev <6 gev. so all of these are allowed. but the options are a, b, c, d. let's see: option a lists c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, τ+τ−, μ+μ−, e+e−. that's all allowed. so that seems correct. option b includes b\bar{b}, which is 2*4.18=8.36 gev >6 gev, so forbidden. so b is wrong. option c includes t\bar{t}, which is 2*173=346 gev, way more than 6 gev. forbidden. so c is wrong. option d includes b\bar{b} again, which is forbidden, so d is wrong. therefore, the correct answer is a. but wait, let me check if there are any other considerations. for example, the interaction term: \mathcal{l}(y) = -\lambda{f}\bar{\psi}{f}(y)(\upsilon + x(y))\psi_{f}(y). this is similar to the yukawa interaction. the term \upsilon is the vev, which gives mass to the fermions when x is the higgs boson. but here, the interaction is with the x field itself. so, the coupling here would lead to the decay x → ff̄ via the vertex λf \bar{ψ}f x ψf. so, all fermions that couple to x are those present in the lagrangian. assuming that all fermions (quarks and leptons) are included in the lagrangian term, then all these fermions are allowed. but the problem doesn't specify which fermions are involved, just "fermions" in general. but given the answer choices include quarks (c, s, u, d, b, t) and leptons (τ, μ, e), we need to check which ones are allowed. but since the problem is about kinematics only, not couplings, even if a fermion isn't coupled, kinematically, if their mass is below the limit, they could decay. but in the standard model, fermions get mass from the higgs via yukawa coupling, so the coupling λf should be non-zero only for fermions that get mass from the higgs. so if x is another boson similar to the higgs, then only fermions that couple to x can decay to them. but the problem says "fermions" in general, but the given answer choices include both quarks and leptons. however, the question is about kinematics, not dynamics. so even if dynamically the coupling is zero, kinematically, if the mass is below the threshold, the decay is allowed. but in the context of exam questions, usually, they consider that only the fermions that are coupled to the boson can decay. so if the interaction is given by that lagrangian, then all fermions that are present in the term \bar{\psi}_f \psi_f coupled to x will decay. so perhaps the answer is all the ones listed in the options that are possible. but the options include heavy quarks like b and t. but according to the lagrangian, if the boson x is similar to the higgs, then all fermions couple to it. but in reality, the higgs decays to fermions only if they are coupled, which all standard model fermions are. but kinematically, the boson mass is 6 gev. so if the higgs (or x) couples to all fermions, but only the ones with mass lower than 6 gev/2 = 3 gev can decay. however, the top quark is 173 gev, so too heavy. but bottom quark is ~4.1 gev, so b decay is not allowed. so if x couples to all fermions, then the possible decays are the ones where 2m_f <6 gev. so fermions with mass less than 3 gev. then the allowed quarks are u, d, s, c (since c is ~1.5 gev). wait, but c is ~1.5 gev, so 2*1.5=3 gev. hmm. so if exact, then c\bar{c} decay would have a threshold at 3 gev. but the x boson is 6 gev, so that would be allowed. but if c quark mass is around 1.2-1.5 gev, so let's say the mass is 1.5 gev, then the pair mass is 3 gev, which is less than 6 gev. so allowed. but if the quark mass is higher, like 1.5 gev, then 3 gev is still less than 6 gev. so allowed. so all of the quarks u, d, s, c are allowed. wait, but then t is too heavy, b is 4.1 gev, so b\bar{b} would be 8.2 gev, which is more than 6 gev. so forbidden. so the allowed quarks are u, d, s, c. leptons: tau is 1.777 gev, so pair mass 3.554 gev <6 gev. muon is 0.1057 gev, pair mass 0.211 gev. electron is 0.0005 gev, pair mass 0.001 gev. so all leptons are allowed. so the decays allowed are u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, s\bar{s}, c\bar{c}, τ\tau, μ\mu, e\+e−. looking at the options: option a lists all of these. option c includes t\bar{t}, which is forbidden. option b includes b\bar{b}, which is forbidden. option d includes b\bar{b}, which is forbidden. so the correct answer should be a. but wait, the options include different combinations. let me check again: a) c\bar{c},s\bar{s},u\bar{u},d\bar{d},τ+τ−,μ+μ−,e+e− yes, all these are allowed. b) b\bar{b},s\bar{s},u\bar{u},d\bar{d},τ+τ−,e+e− here, b\bar{b} is forbidden. but includes τ and e, which are allowed. but since b\bar{b} is forbidden, b is incorrect. c) c\bar{c},s\bar{s},u\bar{u},d\bar{d},t\bar{t},τ+τ−,μ+μ−,e+e− but t\bar{t} is forbidden. so c is incorrect. d) b\bar{b},s\bar{s},u\bar{u},d\bar{d},τ+τ−,μ+μ−,e+e− here, includes b\bar{b}, which is forbidden. so d is incorrect. therefore, the correct answer is a. but wait, another thing to check: the problem says "at the lowest order". since the interaction is a yukawa coupling, the decay is a tree-level process. so all fermions coupled to x can decay at tree level. if all fermions are coupled (as per the lagrangian), then the only limitation is kinematic. so if the only issue is kinematics (mass too high), then the answer is a. but in the options, d is similar to a but includes b\bar{b} and τ, μ, e. wait, but d includes b\bar{b}, which is forbidden. so d is wrong. option a is correct. wait, the options might have some differences in the leptons. let me check: option a includes τ, μ, e. option d includes τ, μ, e as well. but d also includes b\bar{b}, which is forbidden. so if the answer includes all the quarks u, d, s, c (which is in a) and the leptons τ, μ, e, then a is correct. the correct answer is a.

answer: to determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson x with a mass of 6 gev, we need to ensure that the total mass of the decay products (fermion-antifermion pairs) is less than or equal to the boson's mass. 

1. **quark masses**:
   - **u, d**: ~0.005 gev (pair mass ~0.01 gev)
   - **s**: ~0.1 gev (pair mass ~0.2 gev)
   - **c**: ~1.5 gev (pair mass ~3 gev)
   - **b**: ~4.18 gev (pair mass ~8.36 gev, **forbidden**)
   - **t**: ~173 gev (pair mass ~346 gev, **forbidden**)

2. **lepton masses**:
   - **e**: ~0.0005 gev (pair mass ~0.001 gev)
   - **μ**: ~0.1057 gev (pair mass ~0.211 gev)
   - **τ**: ~1.777 gev (pair mass ~3.554 gev)

all quark and lepton pairs with a combined mass less than 6 gev are allowed. the decays involving bottom quarks (b\bar{b}) and top quarks (t\bar{t}) are forbidden due to their high masses. 

evaluating the options:
- **option a** includes all allowed decays: \(c\bar{c}\), \(s\bar{s}\), \(u\bar{u}\), \(d\bar{d}\), \(\tau^+\tau^-\), \(\mu^+\mu^-\), and \(e^+e^-\).
- **option b** and **option d** include \(b\bar{b}\), which is forbidden.
- **option c** includes \(t\bar{t}\), which is forbidden.

the correct answer is **option a**.

\boxed{a}
