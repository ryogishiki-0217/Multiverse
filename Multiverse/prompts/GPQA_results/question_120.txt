Okay, let's see. The problem is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax, assuming stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. The options are 1 over parallax to the power of 1, 2, 3, or 4. Hmm. First, I need to recall what parallax is. Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star due to Earth's orbit around the Sun, right? The parallax angle is inversely proportional to the distance of the star. So, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (d). That means plx = 1/d. Or, d = 1/plx. Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, they want to know if we look at a certain range of parallax values, how does the number of stars in that range change as the parallax changes. Since parallax is related to distance, this is probably similar to asking how the number of stars per distance range changes with distance. But in astronomy, when we consider the number of stars as a function of distance, we have to consider that space is three-dimensional. So the number of stars in a spherical shell of radius d and thickness dd is proportional to the volume of that shell, which is 4πd2 dd. That's the surface area of a sphere (4πd2) times the thickness dd. So number of stars ∝ d2 dd. But here, the question is about parallax. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. Let's substitute that into the expression. If we have d = 1/plx, then the number of stars per unit parallax range... Wait, the problem says "number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx)". So they want the number of stars for a given range of plx, say d(plx). But how does that number vary with plx? Let me think. First, let's relate the number of stars in a distance interval to a parallax interval. Let's denote: - N(d) dd is the number of stars between distance d and d + dd, assuming uniform distribution in space. Since the volume between d and d + dd is 4πd2 dd, and if stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars is proportional to the volume. So N(d) = A d2, where A is some proportionality constant. That gives the number per unit distance? Wait, no. Wait, the number in the shell is proportional to d2 dd. So if you want the number per unit distance, you divide by dd, getting A d2. But here, the question is about parallax. So we need to express this in terms of parallax. Let's do a variable transformation. Given that plx = 1/d. So when d increases, plx decreases. The relation between the change in parallax and the change in distance: If plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. Take the derivative: dd = d(1/plx)/d plx * d plx = -1/plx2 d plx. So dd = -1/plx2 d plx. The absolute value would be 1/plx2 d plx. So, the number of stars between plx and plx + d plx would be N(d) |dd|, which is N(d) * 1/plx2 d plx. But N(d) is A d2. Since d = 1/plx, N(d) = A (1/plx)2. Therefore, substituting back in: Number of stars in plx range d plx is N(d) * 1/plx2 d plx = A (1/plx)2 * 1/plx2 d plx = A/plx4 d plx. Therefore, the number of stars per unit parallax range (d plx) is A/plx4. So the number density in terms of parallax would be proportional to 1/plx4. Therefore, the answer should be ~1/plx^4, which is option C. But wait, let me check again. The steps are: 1. Number of stars in a distance shell is ∝ d2 dd. 2. Convert dd to d plx using plx = 1/d, which gives dd = -1/plx2 d plx. 3. Substitute d = 1/plx into N(d) = A d2, giving N(d) = A/plx2. 4. But when converting the number per distance to number per parallax, we have to multiply by the factor relating dd to d plx, which is 1/plx2. So total number per unit parallax is A/plx2 * 1/plx2 = A/plx4. Yes, that makes sense. Since parallax is inversely related to distance, and the volume (and hence number of stars) increases with the square of the distance, but because we're converting the variable, the dependence becomes steeper. So as parallax decreases (which corresponds to distance increasing), the number of stars per unit parallax range decreases as 1/plx4. That seems right. Let me think if there's another approach. Alternatively, considering that parallax is 1/distance, and the number density of stars in distance is ~d2, so to convert from number per distance to number per parallax, we need to use the Jacobian of the transformation. The transformation is d = 1/plx, so the Jacobian (derivative) is dd/d plx = -1/plx2. The absolute value is 1/plx2. So to get the number density in parallax space, we take the number density in distance space, N(d) = A d2 (but wait, actually, number per unit distance is N(d) = A d2, because between d and d + dd, the volume is ~4πd2 dd, so number of stars is proportional to d2 dd. So per unit distance, it's A d2. Then, to convert to parallax space, you have: N(plx) = N(d) * |dd/d plx| = A d2 * (1/plx2) = A (1/plx)2 * (1/plx2) ) Wait, but since d = 1/plx, substituting back: N(plx) = A (1/plx)^2 * 1/plx2 = A/plx^4. So yes, same result. So the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to 1/plx^4. Therefore, the correct answer is C. But just to check, was there a mistake in the reasoning? The key steps are converting between distance and parallax, and correctly accounting for the change of variables in the density. Since number of stars in distance space is proportional to d2 dd, and when changing variables, we have to multiply by the absolute value of the derivative of d with respect to plx, which is 1/plx2. So putting it all together, it's proportional to d2 * 1/plx2. And since d = 1/plx, substituting back gives 1/(plx)^4. So that's correct. Alternatively, if we think in terms of flux or luminosity, but I think this is more about spatial distribution. Another way to think: in distance cubed, the number of stars would be proportional to volume. But when we look at parallax, which is 1/d, the transformation changes the distribution. So if you have a uniform distribution in space, the number of stars per unit parallax would fall off rapidly as parallax decreases (i.e., as distance increases). So 1/plx^4 makes sense because it combines the 1/plx2 from the original number density (since d^2 = 1/plx^2) and the 1/plx2 from the Jacobian, multiplying them together gives 1/plx^4. That's correct. So definitely, option C. It's not D, which is 1/plx^3. The mistake might be if someone forgets to account for the change of variables and just thinks that since number density goes as d2, and d is 1/plx, then it's 1/plx^2. But that's incorrect because you have to consider how the ranges transform. So the correct answer is C.

Answer: The problem asks how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, assuming stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. 

Key steps:
1. **Parallax and Distance Relationship**: Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance (d), i.e., \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \) or \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \).
2. **Volume Consideration**: The number of stars in a spherical shell of radius \( d \) and thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the volume of that shell, \( 4\pi d^2 dd \).
3. **Variable Transformation**: Convert the distance interval \( dd \) to a parallax interval \( d(\text{plx}) \). Using \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), the derivative \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d(\text{plx}) \). Taking the absolute value, \( |dd| = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d(\text{plx}) \).
4. **Substitution**: Substitute \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) into the volume term \( 4\pi d^2 \), resulting in \( 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \). Multiply this by the factor from the variable transformation \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \) to convert the distance interval to the parallax interval.

Combining these steps, the number of stars per unit parallax range is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{C}\).
