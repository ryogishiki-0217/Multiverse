Okay, so I need to solve this astronomy problem about planetary orbits and transits. Let me start by breaking down the question and understanding all the parts. The problem is about finding the maximum orbital period of a second planet that can exhibit both transit and occultation events. Both planets are in the same system, have circular orbits, and share the same orbital plane. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius, an orbital period of 3 days, and a transit impact parameter of 0.2. The star's radius is 1.5 times the Sun. The second planet has a radius of 2.5 Earth radii. The options for the maximum orbital period are given as A) ~7.5, B) ~33.5, C) ~37.5, D) ~12.5.
First, let's recall what a transit impact parameter is. The impact parameter in transits is the distance between the center of the star and the center of the planet's orbit, divided by the star's radius. For a circular orbit, the impact parameter (b) is calculated as the planet's orbital radius (a) times the cosine of the inclination angle (i), divided by the star's radius (R_star). So, b = (a * cos i) / R_star. The first planet has an impact parameter of 0.2. Since it transits, its inclination must be such that the projection of its orbit passes in front of the star from our viewpoint. The inclination for a transiting planet is typically close to 90 degrees, but the impact parameter can vary. However, since we are given the impact parameter, we can relate the orbital radius and inclination to the star's radius. The problem mentions that both planets share the same orbital plane. So, the second planet will have the same inclination angle as the first planet. The key here is that for both transit and occultation events to be possible, the second planet must have an orbital radius such that its distance of closest approach to the star (when it transits) is less than or equal to the star's radius plus the planet's radius. Otherwise, the planet won't block the star's light enough to be considered a transit. Similarly, for occultation, the planet must pass behind the star as seen from Earth, so the star must be large enough to cover the planet. Wait, but occultation usually refers to the planet passing behind the star. For that to be possible, the star's radius plus the planet's radius should be greater than the orbital radius projected onto our line of sight. But since the orbital plane is the same, the maximum possible projected distance of the planet from the star's center is the orbital radius times sine of inclination (because when the planet is at 90 degrees from the transit position). But for occultation, the planet must pass behind the star, so the star's radius must be larger than the planet's radius plus the projected distance from the star's center. Wait, maybe I need to think about both transit and occultation conditions.
Let's think in parallel.

1: A transit event occurs when a planet passes directly between its star and the observer, thereby blocking some of the star's light. This alignment requires the planet's orbital plane to be oriented such that the planet's path crosses the line of sight from Earth to the star. The specific condition for a transit is that the planet's orbital radius (a) multiplied by the cosine of its orbital inclination (i) must be less than or equal to the sum of the star's radius (R_star) and the planet's radius (R_p). This condition ensures the planet's disk passes in front of the star's disk as seen from Earth. The mathematical expression for this transit condition is a cos i ≤ R_star + R_p. The problem involves a first planet with a known orbital period (3 days) and a transit impact parameter (0.2), which provides information about the orbital parameters. A second planet, with a larger radius (2.5 Earth radii), is to be analyzed for transit and occultation possibilities. The orbital period of this second planet must be determined, with the maximum possible period being the answer.

2: An occultation occurs when a planet passes behind its star as observed from Earth, requiring the star to be large enough to cover the planet. The projected distance of the planet from the star's center at the midpoint of its orbit is given by the orbital radius (a) multiplied by the sine of the orbital inclination (sin i). For an occultation to be possible, this projected distance (a sin i) must be less than the sum of the radii of the star (R_star) and the planet (R_p). This condition ensures the planet can be hidden by the star. Thus, the requirement for an occultation is a sin i < R_star + R_p.
</Path>
<Conclusion>
A transit event is possible if the condition a cos i ≤ R_star + R_p is met, while an occultation is possible if a sin i ≤ R_star + R_p. These geometric conditions relate the orbital parameters and radii of the star and planet.
</Conclusion>

Since both transit and occultation are required, both conditions must be satisfied. So, for the second planet, both:
1. a2 cos i ≤ R_star + R_p2 (transit condition)
2. a2 sin i ≤ R_star + R_p2 (occultation condition)
But we need to find the maximum orbital period (which corresponds to the maximum semi-major axis a2, since orbital period T is related to a^3 via Kepler's third law). So, the maximum a2 that satisfies both conditions. The maximum a2 would be when both inequalities become equalities. So, the maximum a2 would be the smaller of (R_star + R_p2)/cos i and (R_star + R_p2)/sin i. But since we need to satisfy both conditions, the stricter constraint is the smaller value. However, since cos i and sin i are both less than or equal to 1, but depending on the value of i, one could be larger or smaller. But given that the first planet has a transit impact parameter of 0.2, which is b1 = 0.2 = a1 cos i / R_star. So, from the first planet, we can find cos i in terms of a1 and R_star. Then, using Kepler's third law, we can relate a1 and T1 (given as 3 days) to find cos i. Then use that to find the maximum a2 such that both transit and occultation conditions are satisfied. Let's proceed step by step. First, let's note down all given data: First planet: Radius R_p1 = 1 Earth radius. Orbital period T1 = 3 days. Impact parameter b1 = 0.2. Star's radius R_star = 1.5 R_sun. Second planet: Radius R_p2 = 2.5 Earth radii. We need to find the maximum orbital period T2 such that both transit and occultation are possible. Both planets are in circular orbits in the same orbital plane, so same inclination i.

1: Kepler's third law, which states that the square of the orbital period (T) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a), is applied. The orbital radius a1 for the first planet is expressed in terms of its orbital period T1 using the formula a1^3 = (T1^2 * G * (M_star + M_p1)) / (4 * π^2). Given that the mass of the planet (M_p1) is negligible compared to the mass of the star (M_star), the formula simplifies to a1^3 ≈ (T1^2 * G * M_star) / (4 * π^2). The orbital radius a1 can be approximated using the relation a1 ≈ R_sun * (T1 / (1 year))^(2/3), assuming the star's mass is similar to the Sun's. However, this approximation is not suitable for the current problem, which requires a more precise calculation. The mass of the star, M_star, is needed for an accurate calculation. The star's radius (R_star = 1.5 R_sun) is provided, but its mass is not. The problem might assume the star's mass is proportional to its radius, but this is not necessarily the case. The mass-radius relation for stars is generally non-linear. The problem might assume the star's mass is the same as the Sun's, but the star's radius is 1.5 R_sun. This assumption is unlikely, as stars with larger radii typically have masses different from the Sun. The problem's solution might not depend on the star's mass, as the orbital radius can be expressed in terms of the impact parameter and R_star.

The orbital radius a1 can be expressed in terms of the impact parameter and R_star, given that the impact parameter b1 is equal to (a1 cos i) / R_star. This expression for the impact parameter allows for the calculation of cos i without needing the star's mass. The value of cos i can be determined from the impact parameter.

2: The transit impact parameter (b1) is given by the formula b1 = (a1 cos i) / R_star. Substituting the known values, 0.2 = (a1 cos i) / (1.5 R_sun). Solving for the product a1 cos i yields 0.2 * 1.5 R_sun = 0.3 R_sun.

<Conclusion>
The orbital radius a1 is related to the impact parameter and R_star, and the cosine of the inclination angle (cos i) can be calculated using the first planet's impact parameter.
</Conclusion>
</Parallel>
So, from the first planet: b1 = 0.2 = (a1 cos i) / R_star => a1 cos i = b1 * R_star = 0.2 * 1.5 R_sun = 0.3 R_sun. But we also know the orbital period of the first planet is 3 days. Let's use Kepler's third law to relate a1 and M_star. Kepler's third law: (T / yr)^2 = (a / AU)^3 for a system with solar mass. But since the star here may not have solar mass, we need to adjust. The general form is: T^2 = (4π2 / G(M_star + M_p)) a^3. But since the planet masses are much smaller than the star, we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. Let's denote M_star in solar masses. Let's express a1 in terms of AU, T1 in years, and M_star in solar masses. Let's convert T1 to years: 3 days is 3/365.25 ≈ 0.008219 years. Then, Kepler's third law formula: T^2 = (a)^3 / (M_star)^(1/3) ??? Wait, no. Wait, the standard form for Kepler's third law is (T yr)^2 = (a AU)^3 / (M), where M is the mass of the star in solar masses. Wait, actually, more precisely, (T / yr)^2 = (a / AU)^3 / (M_star) when the period is in years, semi-major axis in AU, and M_star in solar masses. So, rearranged: a^3 = M_star * T^2. But this assumes that the gravitational constant G is incorporated into the units. But since we might not know M_star, perhaps we need another approach. However, we might not need the exact value of M_star because we can relate a1 and a2 via Kepler's third law, since the periods will be involved. Wait, but maybe we need to relate the orbital radius a1 of the first planet to find the inclination, and then use that inclination for the second planet. Given that a1 cos i = 0.3 R_star. But R_star is given as 1.5 R_sun. Let's keep track of the units. Let's express a1 in terms of R_sun. Since the star's radius is 1.5 R_sun, and a1 cos i = 0.3 R_sun. So, a1 is in units of solar radii. But for Kepler's third law, we might need to convert a1 into AU. Similarly, we need to relate a1 and T1 to get M_star. Alternatively, maybe we can express cos i in terms of a1 and R_sun, then express a2 in terms of the transit and occultation conditions, then use Kepler's third law to find T2 in terms of a2 and M_star, but since M_star cancels out, we can find T2 in terms of T1. Let me think. First, from the first planet: Kepler's third law: T1^2 = (a1^3 / M_star) * (4π2 / G) ) ? But if we use SI units, it's complicated. Alternatively, use astronomical units. Let me recall that in Kepler's third law, for a given star, (T1 / T2)^2 = (a1^3 / a2^3). But if M_star is the same for both planets, which it is, since they orbit the same star. Therefore, (T1 / T2)2 = (a13 / a23) => T2 = T1 * (a2 / a1)^(3/2). Therefore, if we can find the ratio a2 / a1, then we can find T2. But to find a2, we need to use the transit and occultation conditions for the second planet. But first, we need to find a1 and cos i from the first planet's data. So, let's first get expressions for a1 and cos i. From the first planet: Transit impact parameter: b1 = 0.2 = (a1 cos i) / R_star => a1 cos i = b1 * R_star = 0.2 * 1.5 R_sun = 0.3 R_sun. So, a1 cos i = 0.3 * R_sun. But we need to relate a1 to T1. Let's express a1 in AU. First, convert R_sun to AU. 1 AU is approximately 215 R_sun. So, 0.3 R_sun is 0.3 / 215 ≈ 0.001395 AU. Wait, but maybe we need a more precise value. 1 AU is exactly defined, but approximately, the Sun's radius is about 0.00465 AU. So, let's check: 1 AU = 149,597,870,700 meters. The Sun's radius is about 696,340,000 meters. Therefore, R_sun = 696,340,000 m / 149,597,870,700 m/AU ≈ 0.00465 AU. Therefore, 1.5 R_sun is 1.5 * 0.00465 ≈ 0.00698 AU. Wait, but a1 cos i = 0.2 * R_star = 0.2 * 1.5 R_sun = 0.3 R_sun. So, 0.3 R_sun is 0.3 * 0.00465 AU ≈ 0.001395 AU. Therefore, a1 cos i ≈ 0.001395 AU. But from Kepler's third law, we can find a1. Let's use the formula (T / yr)^2 = (a / AU)^3 / (M_star) But we need M_star. However, since we don't know M_star, perhaps we can express a1 in terms of M_star. Let me write: a13 = M_star * T12 Wait, no. The standard form is: For a planet orbiting a star of mass M_star (in solar masses), the orbital period T (in years) and semi-major axis a (in AU) are related by: a3 = M_star * T2 But wait, actually, I think that formula is incorrect. The correct formula is: (T / yr)2 = (a3 / (M_star + M_p)) for a system where M_star and M_p are in solar masses. But since M_p is much smaller, we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. Therefore, T2 = (a3 / M_star) Therefore, M_star = (a3) / T2 So, if we can express a1 in AU and T1 in years, we can compute M_star. But we need to find a1 first. However, we only have a1 cos i. Hmm. Let me see. Alternatively, maybe we can express cos i in terms of a1: cos i = (a1 cos i) / a1 = (0.3 R_sun) / a1. But a1 is the orbital radius in AU. However, we can write: From Kepler's third law: T12 = (a13 / M_star) So, M_star = a13 / T12 But we need to find M_star in terms of the given data. However, we can also relate cos i from the first planet. So, let's see. Let's express everything step by step. First, we need to relate a1 and cos i from the first planet. We have a1 cos i = 0.3 R_sun. We need to find a1. For that, we need to express M_star in terms of a1 and T1. From Kepler's third law: T12 = (a13 / M_star) => M_star = a13 / T12. But we need to express a1 in AU and T1 in years. Let's convert T1 = 3 days to years: T1 = 3 / 365.25 ≈ 0.008219 years. Now, let's plug into M_star = a13 / T12. But M_star must be in solar masses. Wait, perhaps it's better to express M_star in terms of a1 in AU. Let's do that. Let me denote a1 in AU. Then: M_star = (a13) / (T12) in units of solar masses if a1 is in AU and T1 is in years. So, M_star = (a1)^3 / (0.008219)^2. Therefore, M_star = (a1)^3 / (6.756e-5) ≈ 14808.7 * a13 solar masses. But this can't be correct, since the star's radius is 1.5 R_sun, so it's a star with 1.5 solar radii, which would typically have a mass close to the Sun or a bit higher, but not 14,000 solar masses. Therefore, there must be a miscalculation. Wait, perhaps I need to use the correct form of Kepler's third law. Let's recall that the correct formula is: (T / yr)^2 = (a / AU)^3 / (M_star + M_p) in solar masses. Assuming M_p is negligible, then (T)^2 = (a)^3 / M_star. Therefore, M_star = (a)^3 / T^2. So, yes, that formula. But if we use the given T1 = 3 days = 3/365.25 ≈ 0.008219 years, then M_star would be (a1)^3 / (0.008219)^2. But a1 is in AU. However, the problem is that we don't know a1. But we have a1 in terms of cos i from the impact parameter. So, perhaps we can express M_star in terms of cos i? Wait, a1 is related to cos i via: a1 = (0.3 R_sun) / cos i. But we need to express a1 in AU. 0.3 R_sun is 0.3 * 0.00465 AU ≈ 0.001395 AU. Therefore, a1 = 0.001395 / cos i AU. Then, plugging into M_star = (a1)^3 / T12: M_star = (0.001395 / cos i)^3 / (0.008219)^2 solar masses. Let me compute the numerator and denominator. Numerator: (0.001395 / cos i)^3 Denominator: (0.008219)^2 ≈ 6.756e-5. Therefore, M_star = (0.001395^3 / cos i^3) / 6.756e-5 ≈ (2.705e-9 / cos i^3) / 6.756e-5 ≈ 3.996e-5 / cos i^3 solar masses. Therefore, M_star is approximately 3.996e-5 / cos i^3 solar masses. But this seems very low. For example, if cos i is 1 (i.e., inclination i=0, which is face-on, but impossible for a transiting planet), but in reality, for a transiting planet, cos i must be ≤ (R_star + R_p) / a1, but in this case, the impact parameter is given, so maybe cos i is related to the actual observed transit. Wait, perhaps this approach is getting too convoluted. Let me think if there's another way. Since we need to find the maximum orbital period of the second planet such that both transit and occultation are possible, given the same orbital plane (so same inclination i as the first planet). The key is that for transit, the second planet's orbital radius projected along the line of sight (a2 cos i) must be ≤ R_star + R_p2. Similarly, for occultation, the projected radius perpendicular to the line of sight (a2 sin i) must be ≤ R_star + R_p2. Therefore, both conditions must be satisfied: a2 cos i ≤ R_star + R_p2 a2 sin i ≤ R_star + R_p2 Since we need to maximize a2, we need to consider the most constraining condition. Given that cos i and sin i are both ≤ 1, but their actual values depend on the inclination. However, from the first planet, we can find cos i. Given that the first planet has R_p1 = 1 Earth radius, a1 cos i = 0.3 R_sun (from impact parameter b1 = 0.2 * R_star = 0.3 R_sun). But for the first planet, since it transits, we know that a1 cos i = 0.3 R_sun. Moreover, the star's radius is 1.5 R_sun. The planet's radius is 1 Earth radius; let's convert that to solar radii. Earth's radius is approximately 0.000109 R_sun. Therefore, R_p1 = 0.000109 R_sun. But wait, maybe the planet's radius is given in Earth radii, so R_p2 = 2.5 Earth radii. Therefore, R_p2 = 2.5 * 1 Earth radius. But Earth's radius is about 6,371 km, and the Sun's radius is about 696,340 km. So Earth's radius is approximately 0.0091 * R_sun. Wait: 6371 / 696340 ≈ 0.00914. Therefore, R_p2 = 2.5 Earth radii ≈ 2.5 * 0.00914 R_sun ≈ 0.02286 R_sun. Similarly, the first planet's radius is 1 Earth radius ≈ 0.00914 R_sun. Wait, but in the problem, they mention the radii as "1 Earth radius" and "2.5 times that of Earth". So, R_p1 = 1 Earth radius, R_p2 = 2.5 Earth radii. So, R_p2 = 2.5 * R_p1. But for converting to solar radii, we can compute R_p1 = 1 Earth radius ≈ 0.00914 R_sun, so R_p2 ≈ 0.02286 R_sun. Similarly, the star's radius is 1.5 R_sun. Therefore, for transit and occultation of the second planet: a2 cos i ≤ 1.5 R_sun + 0.02286 R_sun ≈ 1.52286 R_sun a2 sin i ≤ 1.52286 R_sun But we need to find cos i from the first planet. From the first planet: a1 cos i = 0.3 R_sun. Also, the first planet has R_p1 = 0.00914 R_sun. The transit condition for the first planet would require that a1 cos i ≤ R_star + R_p1. Indeed, a1 cos i = 0.3 R_sun. The star's radius is 1.5 R_sun, so 1.5 R_sun + 0.00914 R_sun ≈ 1.50914 R_sun. Since 0.3 R_sun is less than 1.50914 R_sun, the first planet does transit. Therefore, the transit is possible. Now, from this, we can compute cos i. But we also need to find sin i. However, to find sin i, we need to know the orbital inclination. However, since we don't have the inclination, we need to find another way. But wait, we can relate a1 from Kepler's third law. Let's get back to that. From Kepler's third law: T12 = (a13 / M_star) => M_star = (a13) / T12 But we can also express a1 from the impact parameter. Since a1 cos i = 0.3 R_sun. Therefore, a1 = 0.3 R_sun / cos i. But a1 is in units of R_sun. Wait, no: a1 is in AU, while 0.3 R_sun is in R_sun. We need to convert R_sun to AU. As before, 1 R_sun ≈ 0.00465 AU. Therefore, 0.3 R_sun = 0.3 * 0.00465 AU ≈ 0.001395 AU. Therefore, a1 = 0.001395 AU / cos i. Then, plugging into M_star: M_star = ( (0.001395 / cos i )3 ) / (0.008219 )2 ) in solar masses. Let's compute numerator and denominator: Numerator: (0.001395 / cos i )3 Denominator: (0.008219 )2 ≈ 6.756e-5 Therefore, M_star = (0.0013953 / cos i3 ) / 6.756e-5 = (0.0013953 / 6.756e-5) / cos i3. Compute 0.001395^3: 0.001395 * 0.001395 = 0.000001946, then * 0.001395 ≈ 0.000000002708. Divided by 6.756e-5: M_star ≈ (0.000000002708 / 6.756e-5) / cos i3 ≈ (3.999e-5) / cos i3 ≈ 4.0e-5 / cos i3 solar masses. But this is the mass of the star. Wait, but this result is very small. For example, if cos i = 1, then M_star ≈ 4e-5 solar masses, which is a brown dwarf or a very low-mass star. However, the star's radius is 1.5 R_sun, which is larger than the Sun. Such a low-mass star cannot have such a large radius. For example, low-mass stars are generally smaller than the Sun. Therefore, there must be an error in assumptions here. Wait, perhaps the problem is being considered in natural units where G = 1, but I might need to use the correct conversion. Alternatively, maybe I should not convert R_sun to AU, but instead keep the equations in terms of R_sun. Let me try that. Let me express a1 in units of R_sun. From the impact parameter: a1 cos i = 0.3 R_sun. So a1 = 0.3 R_sun / cos i. From Kepler's third law, T12 = (a13 / M_star). But in terms of R_sun and solar masses, the gravitational constant G is such that (T in years, a in AU, M in solar masses): T2 = ( (a3) / (M) ) * (0.002007) where 0.002007 is derived from converting the units. Wait, Kepler's third law in SI units is T2 = (4π2 / (G(M_star)) ) a3. If we plug in G = 6.6743e-11 m3 kg−1 s−2, M_star in kg, a in meters, we can convert to astronomical units. But perhaps an easier way is to remember that for a period in Earth years, semi-major axis in AU, and mass in solar masses, the relation is: (T / yr)2 = ( (a / AU )3 ) / (M_star + M_p) Again, for M_p << M_star, this simplifies to T2 = a3 / M_star. But if T is in years, a in AU, and M_star in solar masses. But in our problem, a1 is in AU, which we need to express. Since we have a1 in terms of R_sun, let's convert AU to R_sun. 1 AU ≈ 215 R_sun (since R_sun ≈ 0.00465 AU => 1 AU / 0.00465 R_sun ≈ 215 R_sun). Therefore, a1 = 0.3 R_sun = 0.3 / 215 AU ≈ 0.001395 AU. But then, plugging into Kepler's third law: T12 = (a13) / M_star => M_star = a13 / T12. a1 = 0.001395 AU (since 0.3 R_sun is 0.001395 AU). T1 = 3 days = 0.008219 years. Therefore, M_star = (0.0013953) / (0.008219)2 ≈ (2.705e-9) / (6.756e-5) ≈ 3.996e-5 solar masses. Again, we get an absurdly low mass for the star, which contradicts the given star radius of 1.5 R_sun. Therefore, there must be a fundamental error in my approach. Wait a second. The error is that I confused the orbital radius a1 with a1 cos i. The transit impact parameter is a1 cos i / R_star = 0.2. So a1 cos i = 0.2 * R_star = 0.2 * 1.5 R_sun = 0.3 R_sun. However, this a1 is in units of R_sun. But when we use Kepler's third law, a1 must be in AU. Therefore, to get a1 in AU, we need to convert 0.3 R_sun to AU. Since 1 R_sun ≈ 0.00465 AU, so 0.3 R_sun ≈ 0.001395 AU. But the problem is that 0.001395 AU is an extremely tight orbit, which would correspond to a very low-mass star or even a planet. For example, Kepler's third law would give, with a1 = 0.001395 AU and T1 = 3 days = 0.008219 years: M_star = a13 / T12 = (0.001395)^3 / (0.008219)^2 ≈ 3.996e-5 solar masses, which is indeed a brown dwarf. But the problem states that the star has a radius of 1.5 R_sun, so this cannot be a brown dwarf, as such low-mass objects cannot have such large radii. Therefore, there must be an error in my interpretation. Wait, perhaps the orbital radius a1 is not 0.3 R_sun, but rather a1 cos i is 0.3 R_sun. The actual semi-major axis a1 is 0.3 R_sun / cos i. Therefore, if cos i is less than 1, a1 would be larger. Therefore, the orbital radius is larger, which would make sense. Let me correct this. So, a1 = (0.3 R_sun) / cos i. Now, to use Kepler's third law, we need a1 in AU. But this a1 is in R_sun. So, converting a1 to AU: 1 R_sun ≈ 0.00465 AU, so a1 = 0.3 R_sun / cos i = 0.3 * 0.00465 / cos i AU ≈ 0.001395 / cos i AU. Then, plugging into Kepler's third law: T12 = (a13 / M_star). So, M_star = a13 / T12. Plugging the numbers: a1 ≈ 0.001395 / cos i AU T1 = 3 days = 0.008219 years. Therefore, M_star = ( (0.001395 / cos i )^3 ) / (0.008219 )^2 ) = (0.001395^3 / cos i^3 ) / 0.008219^2 ≈ (2.705e-9 / cos i^3 ) / 6.756e-5 ≈ 3.996e-5 / cos i^3 solar masses. So, M_star ≈ 3.996e-5 / cos i3. But given that the star's radius is 1.5 R_sun, and low-mass stars can have larger radii, but generally, stars that are more massive than the Sun have larger radii. However, in this case, the derived mass is on the order of 1e-5 solar masses, which is way too low for a star with 1.5 R_sun. Therefore, there must be an issue. Wait, maybe the problem is using R_star = 1.5 R_sun, but the actual calculation for a1 is in units of R_sun. So perhaps we can keep a1 in terms of R_sun, and compute M_star in terms of solar masses. Let me try that. Let's denote a1 in R_sun. Then, a1 = 0.3 R_sun / cos i. Then, using Kepler's third law, but in SI units or appropriate conversion. Alternatively, recall that the orbital period is given by: T = 2π √(a3 / G(M_star)) where a is in meters and M_star in kg. But perhaps we can relate T and a in terms of R_sun. But let's see. Let me use cgs units for simplicity. G = 6.6743e-8 cm3 g−1 s−2. M_star is in units of solar masses (M_sun = 1.989e33 g). a is in AU (1 AU = 1.496e13 cm). T is in seconds, which we can convert to days. But we can use Kepler's third law as: T2 (in seconds) = (4π2 / (G M_star))

okay, so i need to solve this astronomy problem about planetary orbits and transits. let me start by breaking down the question and understanding all the parts. the problem is about finding the maximum orbital period of a second planet that can exhibit both transit and occultation events. both planets are in the same system, have circular orbits, and share the same orbital plane. the first planet has a radius of 1 earth radius, an orbital period of 3 days, and a transit impact parameter of 0.2. the star's radius is 1.5 times the sun. the second planet has a radius of 2.5 earth radii. the options for the maximum orbital period are given as a) ~7.5, b) ~33.5, c) ~37.5, d) ~12.5.
first, let's recall what a transit impact parameter is. the impact parameter in transits is the distance between the center of the star and the center of the planet's orbit, divided by the star's radius. for a circular orbit, the impact parameter (b) is calculated as the planet's orbital radius (a) times the cosine of the inclination angle (i), divided by the star's radius (r_star). so, b = (a * cos i) / r_star. the first planet has an impact parameter of 0.2. since it transits, its inclination must be such that the projection of its orbit passes in front of the star from our viewpoint. the inclination for a transiting planet is typically close to 90 degrees, but the impact parameter can vary. however, since we are given the impact parameter, we can relate the orbital radius and inclination to the star's radius. the problem mentions that both planets share the same orbital plane. so, the second planet will have the same inclination angle as the first planet. the key here is that for both transit and occultation events to be possible, the second planet must have an orbital radius such that its distance of closest approach to the star (when it transits) is less than or equal to the star's radius plus the planet's radius. otherwise, the planet won't block the star's light enough to be considered a transit. similarly, for occultation, the planet must pass behind the star as seen from earth, so the star must be large enough to cover the planet. wait, but occultation usually refers to the planet passing behind the star. for that to be possible, the star's radius plus the planet's radius should be greater than the orbital radius projected onto our line of sight. but since the orbital plane is the same, the maximum possible projected distance of the planet from the star's center is the orbital radius times sine of inclination (because when the planet is at 90 degrees from the transit position). but for occultation, the planet must pass behind the star, so the star's radius must be larger than the planet's radius plus the projected distance from the star's center. wait, maybe i need to think about both transit and occultation conditions.
let's think in parallel.

1: a transit event occurs when a planet passes directly between its star and the observer, thereby blocking some of the star's light. this alignment requires the planet's orbital plane to be oriented such that the planet's path crosses the line of sight from earth to the star. the specific condition for a transit is that the planet's orbital radius (a) multiplied by the cosine of its orbital inclination (i) must be less than or equal to the sum of the star's radius (r_star) and the planet's radius (r_p). this condition ensures the planet's disk passes in front of the star's disk as seen from earth. the mathematical expression for this transit condition is a cos i ≤ r_star + r_p. the problem involves a first planet with a known orbital period (3 days) and a transit impact parameter (0.2), which provides information about the orbital parameters. a second planet, with a larger radius (2.5 earth radii), is to be analyzed for transit and occultation possibilities. the orbital period of this second planet must be determined, with the maximum possible period being the answer.
</path>
<path>
2: an occultation occurs when a planet passes behind its star as observed from earth, requiring the star to be large enough to cover the planet. the projected distance of the planet from the star's center at the midpoint of its orbit is given by the orbital radius (a) multiplied by the sine of the orbital inclination (sin i). for an occultation to be possible, this projected distance (a sin i) must be less than the sum of the radii of the star (r_star) and the planet (r_p). this condition ensures the planet can be hidden by the star. thus, the requirement for an occultation is a sin i < r_star + r_p.
</path>
<conclusion>
a transit event is possible if the condition a cos i ≤ r_star + r_p is met, while an occultation is possible if a sin i ≤ r_star + r_p. these geometric conditions relate the orbital parameters and radii of the star and planet.
</conclusion>
</parallel>
since both transit and occultation are required, both conditions must be satisfied. so, for the second planet, both:
1. a2 cos i ≤ r_star + r_p2 (transit condition)
2. a2 sin i ≤ r_star + r_p2 (occultation condition)
but we need to find the maximum orbital period (which corresponds to the maximum semi-major axis a2, since orbital period t is related to a^3 via kepler's third law). so, the maximum a2 that satisfies both conditions. the maximum a2 would be when both inequalities become equalities. so, the maximum a2 would be the smaller of (r_star + r_p2)/cos i and (r_star + r_p2)/sin i. but since we need to satisfy both conditions, the stricter constraint is the smaller value. however, since cos i and sin i are both less than or equal to 1, but depending on the value of i, one could be larger or smaller. but given that the first planet has a transit impact parameter of 0.2, which is b1 = 0.2 = a1 cos i / r_star. so, from the first planet, we can find cos i in terms of a1 and r_star. then, using kepler's third law, we can relate a1 and t1 (given as 3 days) to find cos i. then use that to find the maximum a2 such that both transit and occultation conditions are satisfied. let's proceed step by step. first, let's note down all given data: first planet: radius r_p1 = 1 earth radius. orbital period t1 = 3 days. impact parameter b1 = 0.2. star's radius r_star = 1.5 r_sun. second planet: radius r_p2 = 2.5 earth radii. we need to find the maximum orbital period t2 such that both transit and occultation are possible. both planets are in circular orbits in the same orbital plane, so same inclination i.

1: kepler's third law, which states that the square of the orbital period (t) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a), is applied. the orbital radius a1 for the first planet is expressed in terms of its orbital period t1 using the formula a1^3 = (t1^2 * g * (m_star + m_p1)) / (4 * π^2). given that the mass of the planet (m_p1) is negligible compared to the mass of the star (m_star), the formula simplifies to a1^3 ≈ (t1^2 * g * m_star) / (4 * π^2). the orbital radius a1 can be approximated using the relation a1 ≈ r_sun * (t1 / (1 year))^(2/3), assuming the star's mass is similar to the sun's. however, this approximation is not suitable for the current problem, which requires a more precise calculation. the mass of the star, m_star, is needed for an accurate calculation. the star's radius (r_star = 1.5 r_sun) is provided, but its mass is not. the problem might assume the star's mass is proportional to its radius, but this is not necessarily the case. the mass-radius relation for stars is generally non-linear. the problem might assume the star's mass is the same as the sun's, but the star's radius is 1.5 r_sun. this assumption is unlikely, as stars with larger radii typically have masses different from the sun. the problem's solution might not depend on the star's mass, as the orbital radius can be expressed in terms of the impact parameter and r_star.

the orbital radius a1 can be expressed in terms of the impact parameter and r_star, given that the impact parameter b1 is equal to (a1 cos i) / r_star. this expression for the impact parameter allows for the calculation of cos i without needing the star's mass. the value of cos i can be determined from the impact parameter. the orbital radius a1 can subsequently be found if necessary.

2: the transit impact parameter (b1) is given by the formula b1 = (a1 cos i) / r_star. substituting the known values, 0.2 = (a1 cos i) / (1.5 r_sun). solving for the product a1 cos i yields 0.2 * 1.5 r_sun = 0.3 r_sun.
</path>
<conclusion>
the orbital radius a1 is related to the impact parameter and r_star, and the cosine of the inclination angle (cos i) can be calculated using the first planet's impact parameter.

</parallel>
so, from the first planet: b1 = 0.2 = (a1 cos i) / r_star => a1 cos i = b1 * r_star = 0.2 * 1.5 r_sun = 0.3 r_sun. but we also know the orbital period of the first planet is 3 days. let's use kepler's third law to relate a1 and m_star. kepler's third law: (t / yr)^2 = (a / au)^3 for a system with solar mass. but since the star here may not have solar mass, we need to adjust. the general form is: t^2 = (4π2 / g(m_star + m_p)) a^3. but since the planet masses are much smaller than the star, we can approximate m_star + m_p ≈ m_star. let's denote m_star in solar masses. let's express a1 in terms of au, t1 in years, and m_star in solar masses. let's convert t1 to years: 3 days is 3/365.25 ≈ 0.008219 years. then, kepler's third law formula: t^2 = (a)^3 / (m_star)^(1/3) ??? wait, no. wait, the standard form for kepler's third law is (t yr)^2 = (a au)^3 / (m), where m is the mass of the star in solar masses. wait, actually, more precisely, (t / yr)^2 = (a / au)^3 / (m_star) when the period is in years, semi-major axis in au, and m_star in solar masses. so, rearranged: a^3 = m_star * t^2. but this assumes that the gravitational constant g is incorporated into the units. but since we might not know m_star, perhaps we need another approach. however, we might not need the exact value of m_star because we can relate a1 and a2 via kepler's third law, since the periods will be involved. wait, but maybe we need to relate the orbital radius a1 of the first planet to find the inclination, and then use that inclination for the second planet. given that a1 cos i = 0.3 r_star. but r_star is given as 1.5 r_sun. let's keep track of the units. let's express a1 in terms of r_sun. since the star's radius is 1.5 r_sun, and a1 cos i = 0.3 r_sun. so, a1 is in units of solar radii. but for kepler's third law, we might need to convert a1 into au. similarly, we need to relate a1 and t1 to get m_star. alternatively, maybe we can express cos i in terms of a1 and r_sun, then express a2 in terms of the transit and occultation conditions, then use kepler's third law to find t2 in terms of a2 and m_star, but since m_star cancels out, we can find t2 in terms of t1. let me think. first, from the first planet: kepler's third law: t1^2 = (a1^3 / m_star) * (4π2 / g) ) ? but if we use si units, it's complicated. alternatively, use astronomical units. let me recall that in kepler's third law, for a given star, (t1 / t2)^2 = (a1^3 / a2^3). but if m_star is the same for both planets, which it is, since they orbit the same star. therefore, (t1 / t2)2 = (a13 / a23) => t2 = t1 * (a2 / a1)^(3/2). therefore, if we can find the ratio a2 / a1, then we can find t2. but to find a2, we need to use the transit and occultation conditions for the second planet. but first, we need to find a1 and cos i from the first planet's data. so, let's first get expressions for a1 and cos i. from the first planet: transit impact parameter: b1 = 0.2 = (a1 cos i) / r_star => a1 cos i = b1 * r_star = 0.2 * 1.5 r_sun = 0.3 r_sun. so, a1 cos i = 0.3 * r_sun. but we need to relate a1 to t1. let's express a1 in au. first, convert r_sun to au. 1 au is approximately 215 r_sun. so, 0.3 r_sun is 0.3 / 215 ≈ 0.001395 au. wait, but maybe we need a more precise value. 1 au is exactly defined, but approximately, the sun's radius is about 0.00465 au. so, let's check: 1 au = 149,597,870,700 meters. the sun's radius is about 696,340,000 meters. therefore, r_sun = 696,340,000 m / 149,597,870,700 m/au ≈ 0.00465 au. therefore, 1.5 r_sun is 1.5 * 0.00465 ≈ 0.00698 au. wait, but a1 cos i = 0.2 * r_star = 0.2 * 1.5 r_sun = 0.3 r_sun. so, 0.3 r_sun is 0.3 * 0.00465 au ≈ 0.001395 au. therefore, a1 cos i ≈ 0.001395 au. but from kepler's third law, we can find a1. let's use the formula (t / yr)^2 = (a / au)^3 / (m_star) but we need m_star. however, since we don't know m_star, perhaps we can express a1 in terms of m_star. let me write: a13 = m_star * t12 wait, no. the standard form is: for a planet orbiting a star of mass m_star (in solar masses), the orbital period t (in years) and semi-major axis a (in au) are related by: a3 = m_star * t2 but wait, actually, i think that formula is incorrect. the correct formula is: (t / yr)2 = (a3 / (m_star + m_p)) for a system where m_star and m_p are in solar masses. but since m_p is much smaller, we can approximate m_star + m_p ≈ m_star. therefore, t2 = (a3 / m_star) therefore, m_star = (a3) / t2 so, if we can express a1 in au and t1 in years, we can compute m_star. but we need to find a1 first. however, we only have a1 cos i. hmm. let me see. alternatively, maybe we can express cos i in terms of a1: cos i = (a1 cos i) / a1 = (0.3 r_sun) / a1. but a1 is the orbital radius in au. however, we can write: from kepler's third law: t12 = (a13 / m_star) so, m_star = a13 / t12 but we need to find m_star in terms of the given data. however, we can also relate cos i from the first planet. so, let's see. let's express everything step by step. first, we need to relate a1 and cos i from the first planet. we have a1 cos i = 0.3 r_sun. we need to find a1. for that, we need to express m_star in terms of a1 and t1. from kepler's third law: t12 = (a13 / m_star) => m_star = a13 / t12. but we need to express a1 in au and t1 in years. let's convert t1 = 3 days to years: t1 = 3 / 365.25 ≈ 0.008219 years. now, let's plug into m_star = a13 / t12. but m_star must be in solar masses. wait, perhaps it's better to express m_star in terms of a1 in au. let's do that. let me denote a1 in au. then: m_star = (a13) / (t12) in units of solar masses if a1 is in au and t1 is in years. so, m_star = (a1)^3 / (0.008219)^2. therefore, m_star = (a1)^3 / (6.756e-5) ≈ 14808.7 * a13 solar masses. but this can't be correct, since the star's radius is 1.5 r_sun, so it's a star with 1.5 solar radii, which would typically have a mass close to the sun or a bit higher, but not 14,000 solar masses. therefore, there must be a miscalculation. wait, perhaps i need to use the correct form of kepler's third law. let's recall that the correct formula is: (t / yr)^2 = (a / au)^3 / (m_star + m_p) in solar masses. assuming m_p is negligible, then (t)^2 = (a)^3 / m_star. therefore, m_star = (a)^3 / t^2. so, yes, that formula. but if we use the given t1 = 3 days = 3/365.25 ≈ 0.008219 years, then m_star would be (a1)^3 / (0.008219)^2. but a1 is in au. however, the problem is that we don't know a1. but we have a1 in terms of cos i from the impact parameter. so, perhaps we can express m_star in terms of cos i? wait, a1 is related to cos i via: a1 = (0.3 r_sun) / cos i. but we need to express a1 in au. 0.3 r_sun is 0.3 * 0.00465 au ≈ 0.001395 au. therefore, a1 = 0.001395 / cos i au. then, plugging into m_star = (a1)^3 / t12: m_star = (0.001395 / cos i)^3 / (0.008219)^2 solar masses. let me compute the numerator and denominator. numerator: (0.001395 / cos i)^3 denominator: (0.008219)^2 ≈ 6.756e-5. therefore, m_star = (0.001395^3 / cos i^3) / 6.756e-5 ≈ (2.705e-9 / cos i^3) / 6.756e-5 ≈ 3.996e-5 / cos i^3 solar masses. therefore, m_star is approximately 3.996e-5 / cos i^3 solar masses. but this seems very low. for example, if cos i is 1 (i.e., inclination i=0, which is face-on, but impossible for a transiting planet), but in reality, for a transiting planet, cos i must be ≤ (r_star + r_p) / a1, but in this case, the impact parameter is given, so maybe cos i is related to the actual observed transit. wait, perhaps this approach is getting too convoluted. let me think if there's another way. since we need to find the maximum orbital period of the second planet such that both transit and occultation are possible, given the same orbital plane (so same inclination i as the first planet). the key is that for transit, the second planet's orbital radius projected along the line of sight (a2 cos i) must be ≤ r_star + r_p2. similarly, for occultation, the projected radius perpendicular to the line of sight (a2 sin i) must be ≤ r_star + r_p2. therefore, both conditions must be satisfied: a2 cos i ≤ r_star + r_p2 a2 sin i ≤ r_star + r_p2 since we need to maximize a2, we need to consider the most constraining condition. given that cos i and sin i are both ≤ 1, but their actual values depend on the inclination. however, from the first planet, we can find cos i. given that the first planet has r_p1 = 1 earth radius, a1 cos i = 0.3 r_sun (from impact parameter b1 = 0.2 * r_star = 0.3 r_sun). but for the first planet, since it transits, we know that a1 cos i = 0.3 r_sun. moreover, the star's radius is 1.5 r_sun. the planet's radius is 1 earth radius; let's convert that to solar radii. earth's radius is approximately 0.000109 r_sun. therefore, r_p1 = 0.000109 r_sun. but wait, maybe the planet's radius is given in earth radii, so r_p2 = 2.5 earth radii. therefore, r_p2 = 2.5 * 1 earth radius. but earth's radius is about 6,371 km, and the sun's radius is about 696,340 km. so earth's radius is approximately 0.0091 * r_sun. wait: 6371 / 696340 ≈ 0.00914. therefore, r_p2 = 2.5 earth radii ≈ 2.5 * 0.00914 r_sun ≈ 0.02286 r_sun. similarly, the first planet's radius is 1 earth radius ≈ 0.00914 r_sun. wait, but in the problem, they mention the radii as "1 earth radius" and "2.5 times that of earth". so, r_p1 = 1 earth radius, r_p2 = 2.5 earth radii. so, r_p2 = 2.5 * r_p1. but for converting to solar radii, we can compute r_p1 = 1 earth radius ≈ 0.00914 r_sun, so r_p2 ≈ 0.02286 r_sun. similarly, the star's radius is 1.5 r_sun. therefore, for transit and occultation of the second planet: a2 cos i ≤ 1.5 r_sun + 0.02286 r_sun ≈ 1.52286 r_sun a2 sin i ≤ 1.52286 r_sun but we need to find cos i from the first planet. from the first planet: a1 cos i = 0.3 r_sun. also, the first planet has r_p1 = 0.00914 r_sun. the transit condition for the first planet would require that a1 cos i ≤ r_star + r_p1. indeed, a1 cos i = 0.3 r_sun. the star's radius is 1.5 r_sun, so 1.5 r_sun + 0.00914 r_sun ≈ 1.50914 r_sun. since 0.3 r_sun is less than 1.50914 r_sun, the first planet does transit. therefore, the transit is possible. now, from this, we can compute cos i. but we also need to find sin i. however, to find sin i, we need to know the orbital inclination. however, since we don't have the inclination, we need to find another way. but wait, we can relate a1 from kepler's third law. let's get back to that. from kepler's third law: t12 = (a13 / m_star) => m_star = (a13) / t12 but we can also express a1 from the impact parameter. since a1 cos i = 0.3 r_sun. therefore, a1 = 0.3 r_sun / cos i. but a1 is in units of r_sun. wait, no: a1 is in au, while 0.3 r_sun is in r_sun. we need to convert r_sun to au. as before, 1 r_sun ≈ 0.00465 au. therefore, 0.3 r_sun = 0.3 * 0.00465 au ≈ 0.001395 au. therefore, a1 = 0.001395 au / cos i. then, plugging into m_star: m_star = ( (0.001395 / cos i )3 ) / (0.008219 )2 ) in solar masses. let's compute numerator and denominator: numerator: (0.001395 / cos i )3 denominator: (0.008219 )2 ≈ 6.756e-5 therefore, m_star = (0.0013953 / cos i3 ) / 6.756e-5 = (0.0013953 / 6.756e-5) / cos i3. compute 0.001395^3: 0.001395 * 0.001395 = 0.000001946, then * 0.001395 ≈ 0.000000002708. divided by 6.756e-5: m_star ≈ (0.000000002708 / 6.756e-5) / cos i3 ≈ (3.999e-5) / cos i3 ≈ 4.0e-5 / cos i3 solar masses. but this is the mass of the star. wait, but this result is very small. for example, if cos i = 1, then m_star ≈ 4e-5 solar masses, which is a brown dwarf or a very low-mass star. however, the star's radius is 1.5 r_sun, which is larger than the sun. such a low-mass star cannot have such a large radius. for example, low-mass stars are generally smaller than the sun. therefore, there must be an error in assumptions here. wait, perhaps the problem is being considered in natural units where g = 1, but i might need to use the correct conversion. alternatively, maybe i should not convert r_sun to au, but instead keep the equations in terms of r_sun. let me try that. let me express a1 in units of r_sun. from the impact parameter: a1 cos i = 0.3 r_sun. so a1 = 0.3 r_sun / cos i. from kepler's third law, t12 = (a13 / m_star). but in terms of r_sun and solar masses, the gravitational constant g is such that (t in years, a in au, m in solar masses): t2 = ( (a3) / (m) ) * (0.002007) where 0.002007 is derived from converting the units. wait, kepler's third law in si units is t2 = (4π2 / (g(m_star)) ) a3. if we plug in g = 6.6743e-11 m3 kg−1 s−2, m_star in kg, a in meters, we can convert to astronomical units. but perhaps an easier way is to remember that for a period in earth years, semi-major axis in au, and mass in solar masses, the relation is: (t / yr)2 = ( (a / au )3 ) / (m_star + m_p) again, for m_p << m_star, this simplifies to t2 = a3 / m_star. but if t is in years, a in au, and m_star in solar masses. but in our problem, a1 is in au, which we need to express. since we have a1 in terms of r_sun, let's convert au to r_sun. 1 au ≈ 215 r_sun (since r_sun ≈ 0.00465 au => 1 au / 0.00465 r_sun ≈ 215 r_sun). therefore, a1 = 0.3 r_sun = 0.3 / 215 au ≈ 0.001395 au. but then, plugging into kepler's third law: t12 = (a13) / m_star => m_star = a13 / t12. a1 = 0.001395 au (since 0.3 r_sun is 0.001395 au). t1 = 3 days = 0.008219 years. therefore, m_star = (0.0013953) / (0.008219)2 ≈ (2.705e-9) / (6.756e-5) ≈ 3.996e-5 solar masses. again, we get an absurdly low mass for the star, which contradicts the given star radius of 1.5 r_sun. therefore, there must be a fundamental error in my approach. wait a second. the error is that i confused the orbital radius a1 with a1 cos i. the transit impact parameter is a1 cos i / r_star = 0.2. so a1 cos i = 0.2 * r_star = 0.2 * 1.5 r_sun = 0.3 r_sun. however, this a1 is in units of r_sun. but when we use kepler's third law, a1 must be in au. therefore, to get a1 in au, we need to convert 0.3 r_sun to au. since 1 r_sun ≈ 0.00465 au, so 0.3 r_sun ≈ 0.001395 au. but the problem is that 0.001395 au is an extremely tight orbit, which would correspond to a very low-mass star or even a planet. for example, kepler's third law would give, with a1 = 0.001395 au and t1 = 3 days = 0.008219 years: m_star = a13 / t12 = (0.001395)^3 / (0.008219)^2 ≈ 3.996e-5 solar masses, which is indeed a brown dwarf. but the problem states that the star has a radius of 1.5 r_sun, so this cannot be a brown dwarf, as such low-mass objects cannot have such large radii. therefore, there must be an error in my interpretation. wait, perhaps the orbital radius a1 is not 0.3 r_sun, but rather a1 cos i is 0.3 r_sun. the actual semi-major axis a1 is 0.3 r_sun / cos i. therefore, if cos i is less than 1, a1 would be larger. therefore, the orbital radius is larger, which would make sense. let me correct this. so, a1 = (0.3 r_sun) / cos i. now, to use kepler's third law, we need a1 in au. but this a1 is in r_sun. so, converting a1 to au: 1 r_sun ≈ 0.00465 au, so a1 = 0.3 r_sun / cos i = 0.3 * 0.00465 / cos i au ≈ 0.001395 / cos i au. then, plugging into kepler's third law: t12 = (a13 / m_star). so, m_star = a13 / t12. plugging the numbers: a1 ≈ 0.001395 / cos i au t1 = 3 days = 0.008219 years. therefore, m_star = ( (0.001395 / cos i )^3 ) / (0.008219 )^2 ) = (0.001395^3 / cos i^3 ) / 0.008219^2 ≈ (2.705e-9 / cos i^3 ) / 6.756e-5 ≈ 3.996e-5 / cos i^3 solar masses. so, m_star ≈ 3.996e-5 / cos i3. but given that the star's radius is 1.5 r_sun, and low-mass stars can have larger radii, but generally, stars that are more massive than the sun have larger radii. however, in this case, the derived mass is on the order of 1e-5 solar masses, which is way too low for a star with 1.5 r_sun. therefore, there must be an issue. wait, maybe the problem is using r_star = 1.5 r_sun, but the actual calculation for a1 is in units of r_sun. so perhaps we can keep a1 in terms of r_sun, and compute m_star in terms of solar masses. let me try that. let's denote a1 in r_sun. then, a1 = 0.3 r_sun / cos i. then, using kepler's third law, but in si units or appropriate conversion. alternatively, recall that the orbital period is given by: t = 2π √(a3 / g(m_star)) where a is in meters and m_star in kg. but perhaps we can relate t and a in terms of r_sun. but let's see. let me use cgs units for simplicity. g = 6.6743e-8 cm3 g−1 s−2. m_star is in units of solar masses (m_sun = 1.989e33 g). a is in au (1 au = 1.496e13 cm). t is in seconds, which we can convert to days. but we can use kepler's third law as: t2 (in seconds) = (4π2 / (g m_star))
